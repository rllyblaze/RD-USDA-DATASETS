Referring to the owner can also mean the owner's representative or \nengineer. \n \n \nBorrowers or their engineering representatives will need to complete and add to this \nspecification as appropriate.  Modifications to this specification may be necessary to \nconsider special applications or preferences of the owner. \n \n2   \nSCOPE   \n \n \nThis suggested purchase specification covers the technical aspects of design, materials, \nmanufacturing, inspection, testing, and delivery of direct embedded standard class \nprestressed concrete poles. It is recommended that this specification be limited to poles \nwhich are not guyed, not subjected to unbalanced lateral loads, or do not have deflection \nlimitations or other special limitations. For concrete pole applications which consider \nthese items, it is recommended that the owner use Guide Specification for Prestressed \nConcrete Pole and Concrete Pole Structures, Bulletin 1724E-206.  \n \n \nThis guide specification does not include contract (front-end) documents or specifications \nfor construction.  The user of this specification should add these documents, including \ngeneral conditions and any supplemental instructions to the bidders.  This specification \nmay be expanded to include H-frame structures. \n \n3   \nINITIAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS   \n \n \nThere are several engineering decisions required of the user of this specification to \ndetermine which standard class concrete poles to specify.  Some examples include, but \nare not limited to: \n \n\u2022 Amount of foundation rotation and deflection to consider for incorporating P-delta \nmoments; \n\u2022 Location of point of fixity; \n\u2022 Embedment depths; \n\u2022 Load cases to be considered in addition to those required by the National Electrical \nSafety Code (NESC); and \n\u2022 Deflection limitations. \n \n \nPrior to the selection of a standard class pole, the user should perform the engineering \nrequired for these types of issues or employ an engineering consultant to do so. See \nAppendix A of this bulletin for a discussion of some of these items."

The specification should contain sufficient requirements and information \nso that all bids can be evaluated equally and so that the manufacturer clearly understands \nwhat is expected of the manufacturer. \n \nScope \n \nWhile this standard class concrete pole specification does not prohibit the application to \npoles which are guyed, which are subjected to unbalanced lateral loads, or which have \ndeflection or other special limitations, the owner must be prudent in this type of \napplication. \n \nIt is recognized that, with the proper understanding and usage of some computerized \nstructural analysis and transmission line design programs, it is possible to select a \nstandard class concrete pole which might otherwise be beyond the scope of this \nspecification. The owner must be sure that combined bending and buckling analysis is \nperformed, that cracking strength and zero tension strength is evaluated, and that \ndeflections are properly modeled.  \n \nThe owner should recognize when the design of a concrete pole may be more prudently \naccomplished using the Guide Specification for Prestressed Concrete Pole and Concrete \nPole Structures, RUS Bulletin 1724E-206, which requires the actual loading conditions \nto be specified. In using RUS Bulletin 1724E-206, the manufacturer assumes full \nresponsibility in designing and manufacturing a structurally adequate pole.  \n \nStandard Class Pole \n \nIn some cases, utilities prefer to specify certain concrete poles to be designed according \nto a standardized loading criteria, much like the standard classifications for wood poles. \n \nIn utilizing standard class concrete poles, a complete structural analysis is still required \nfor all structures. All appropriate loading criteria are considered in the analysis. Once the \nrequired concrete pole strength is determined, a standard class concrete pole which meets \nthe actual loading conditions can be selected. A design example is shown in Appendix C. \n \nThis specification was developed to establish a standard classification system and to \nassist the owner in procuring a standard class concrete pole which is properly designed \nfor the intended loading criteria. \n \nThis guide specification attempts to eliminate ambiguity in specifying and purchasing \nstandard class concrete poles.

      "content": "Bulletin 1724E-216 \nAppendix A \nPage 2 \n \nto design and manufacture poles which are based on the wood pole classification system \nof the American National Standards Institute (ANSI 05.1), the concrete pole \nclassifications developed in this specification generally follow the wood pole \nclassification system. However, to avoid confusion with the wood pole classifications, the \nconcrete pole classifications have a unique naming system. \n \nWood Pole Equivalency \n \n \n \nIn some cases, the owner may design a transmission line based on wood pole \nclassifications as described in ANSI 05.1, Wood Pole Specifications and Dimensions, and \nthen wish to order concrete poles which meet the wood pole equivalent loadings. Because \nof the differences in strength factors applied to wood poles in comparison to concrete \npoles, the owner must be sure that the strength factors are properly accounted for in the \ndesign of the concrete poles.  \n \n\u201cWood pole equivalent\u201d is a term that may be defined in a number of ways. For purposes \nof this commentary, the term \u201cwood pole equivalent\u201d is defined as a standard class \nprestressed concrete pole which is equated by required ultimate loading to an ANSI 05.1 \nstandard class wood pole. The equation is made by a ratio of the strength factors \napplicable for each pole type and loading criteria. \n \nThe design and purchase of concrete poles as an equivalent to wood poles can be vague \neven with clear instructions. As such, the owner should be sure that the equivalency is \nproperly determined. Once the equivalency is determined, the owner should specify the \nstandard class concrete pole based on the classifications detailed in Section 4.1.2. In \ndoing this, the manufacturer will not be involved in the equivalency process and the \nambiguity should be eliminated. \n \nThe wood pole equivalency is based on the required ultimate moment capacity of the pole \nat the groundline based on embedment depths shown in ANSI 05.1. In obtaining a \nsuitable equivalency, the owner must consider factors other than the equivalent \ngroundline moment. For example, the differences in material and section properties of the \nwood pole versus the concrete pole will result in differences in buckling analysis, pole \ndeflections, secondary moments, applied wind forces, and so forth. \n \nIt is impossible to completely equate the concrete pole and wood pole at all points along \nthe pole. The owner must be certain that the concrete pole selected by equivalency \nmethods will have a strength sufficient for the actual application. \n \nEquivalency Factor (Eq.F) \n \nThe equivalency factor (Eq.F) is defined as the ratio of the wood pole strength factor to \nthe concrete pole strength factor for a given loading condition.  \n \nFor example, for NESC Grade B district loading, the wood pole strength factor is 0.65 \nand the concrete pole strength factor is 1.00. Thus, the equivalency factor will be \n0.65/1.00 = 0.650."

      "content": "Bulletin 1724E-216 \nAppendix A \nPage 3 \n \nThe equivalency factor is a useful concept to understand as the owner requires a wood \npole equivalent under various loading conditions and load factors. Several examples of \nequivalencies are listed in the following sections. \n \nWood Pole Equivalency \u2013 0.65 TO 1.00 Ratio (0.65 Eq.F) \n \nFor the NESC Grade B district loadings, the NESC allows for a strength factor of 1.00 to \nbe applied to a load on a concrete pole while it requires a strength factor of 0.65 to be \napplied to a load on a wood pole. As such, the ultimate strength requirement for the \nconcrete pole will be less than the ultimate strength of the wood pole for the district \nloading conditions. \n \nFor example, the owner designs a transmission line for wood poles based on NESC \ndistrict wind loading conditions. The owner wishes to purchase a concrete pole which is \nequivalent to a Class 1 wood pole. Based on ANSI 05.1, the Class 1 wood pole \ngroundline strength is derived by applying a horizontal ultimate load of 4,500 pounds at \n2' from the pole tip based on a simple cantilever. Since the owner had classed the wood \npole based on an NESC strength factor of 0.65, the owner wishes to select a concrete pole \nmeeting the same NESC district wind loading conditions. To do this, the owner will \nmultiply the required tip loading of 4,500 pounds by 0.65/1.00, which equals 2,925 \npounds. The 0.65/1.00 ratio (or 0.65 Eq.F) adjusts for the difference between wood and \nconcrete strength factors for NESC district loads. The owner will then select a standard \nclass concrete pole which has an ultimate moment capacity based on the horizontal tip \nloading of at least 2,925 pounds. From Section 4.1.2, the owner selects a class  \nC-02.9 pole, which has a tip loading of 2,925 pounds. \n \nBased on the method shown in this example, Table A-1 (at the end of this section) is a \ntabulation of wood pole equivalencies based on the NESC Grade B district loading. \n \nWood Pole Equivalency - 0.75 TO 1.00 Ratio (0.75 Eq.F) \n \nFor the NESC Grade B extreme wind loadings, this specification requires a strength \nfactor of 1.00 to be applied to concrete poles for the transverse extreme wind \nload condition  while the NESC requires a strength factor of 0.75 to be applied to a wood \npole under the extreme wind load condition. As such, the initial ultimate strength \nrequirement for the concrete pole will appear to be less than the ultimate strength of the \nwood pole for the NESC extreme wind loading conditions. \n \nFor example, the owner designs a transmission line for wood poles based on NESC \nextreme wind loading conditions. The owner wishes to purchase a concrete pole which is \nequivalent to a Class 1 wood pole. Based on ANSI 05.1, the Class 1 wood pole \ngroundline strength is derived by applying a horizontal ultimate load of 4,500 pounds at \n2' from the pole tip based on a simple cantilever. Since the owner had classed the wood \npole based on an NESC extreme wind strength factor of 0.75, the owner wishes to select \na concrete pole meeting the same extreme wind loading conditions. To do this, the owner \nwill multiply the required tip loading of 4,500 pounds by 0.75/1.00, which equals 3,375 \npounds. The 0.75/1.00 ratio (or 0.75 Eq.F) adjusts for the difference between wood and \nconcrete extreme wind strength factors. The owner will then select a standard class"

One common application of this is when the \nowner designs a transmission line using wood pole properties, but utilizing concrete pole \nstrength factors. In this case, the owner has accounted for the difference in wood versus \nconcrete strength factors during the design of the project. \n \nFor example, the owner designs a transmission line for wood poles based on NESC \ndistrict wind loading conditions. However, knowing that concrete poles will be utilized, \nthe owner uses the NESC district wind strength factor of 1.00 (applicable to concrete \npoles) in the calculations. The owner selects a wood pole Class 1 at a specific location. \nThus, the owner wishes to purchase a concrete pole which is equivalent in ultimate \nstrength to a Class 1 wood pole. Based on ANSI 05.1, the Class 1 wood pole groundline \nstrength is derived by applying a horizontal ultimate load of 4,500 pounds at 2' from the \npole tip based on a simple cantilever. Therefore, the owner will require a concrete pole \nwith an ultimate moment capacity based on the same 4,500 pound tip loading. From \nSection 4.1.2, the owner selects a Class C-04.9 concrete pole, which has a tip loading of \n4,875 pounds. \n \nBased on the method shown in the this example, Table A-3 at the end of this section is a \ntabulation of wood pole equivalencies based on the ultimate-to-ultimate strength \ncomparison, or 1.0 equivalency factor."

Consideration should be given for \nstrength requirements at all points along the pole, not just at the groundline. \n \nP-Delta Moment \n \nPrior to selecting a standard class concrete pole, the owner should determine the effect of \nthe secondary moments due to the vertical loadings, including the effect of the pole \nweight, during the transmission line design process. \n \nWhenever there is a transverse or longitudinal load, the pole will deflect in the direction \nof the load.  As a result, the vertical load is no longer in its original position.  The vertical \nload moves over as the pole deflects, causing additional moments in the pole.  Also, the \npole weight can place significant secondary moment loads in the pole. The additional \nstress caused by this secondary moment is dependent on the magnitude of the vertical \nload and deflected shape of the pole.  Many pole designs, particularly tall poles, have to \nbe calculated for the position of equilibrium of forces in the fully displaced position.  The \nsolution typically takes many iterations.  A full nonlinear analysis will consider the \nchange in orientation of the loads relative to the displaced positions of the structural \nmembers.  \n \nAs a minimum, an approximate method for determining the effect of the secondary \nmoments should be utilized, such as the method given in the RUS Bulletin 1724E-200. \n \nPole Tip Strength (Section 4.1.2) \n \nThis specification sets minimum ultimate moment capacity requirements near the pole tip \nfor each standard pole classification.

When applied to the Douglas Fir or Southern Yellow Pine poles with a \nfiber stress of 8,000 psi, the resulting tip strength is calculated as 41.5 ft-kips for the \nClass 1 wood pole.  \n \nBecause the conductors and shield wire supports are typically located on crossarms away \nfrom the pole axis, significant moments can be generated in the pole near the tip. The \nmoments are greatly increased whenever a braced pole top assembly is utilized. These \nmoments are not accounted for by applying the horizontal ultimate loading alone. \nTherefore, in the design of transmission poles, it is critical that a minimum ultimate \nmoment capacity be specified near the pole tip. In the absence of a minimum tip strength \nrequirement, a concrete pole tip strength can theoretically be negligible. \n \nThe minimum pole tip strength required by this specification should be suitable for most \ntransmission line applications. However, the owner must be sure that the tip strength is \nproperly evaluated, especially when working with wood pole equivalencies and braced \nstructures. \n \nPoint of Fixity (Section 4.1.2) \n \nPoint of fixity for this specification is defined as the location on the pole where maximum \nmoment occurs.  Maximum moment is calculated by the pole designer using the loadings \nprovided by the owner and multiplying those loadings by the appropriate moment arms.  \nThe existing soil and backfill has to be able to support the pole with these bending \nmoments applied.  The location of this point of fixity could be at or below the groundline.  \nThe exact location is theoretical and depends on the soil condition and backfill used to \nsupport the pole. \n \nFor the standard class pole, the point of fixity should remain at the same location on the \npole, regardless of the embedment depth the owner may specify for a given application. \nOtherwise, the required pole strength could vary as the location of the point of fixity \nvaries. Within the scope of this standard class pole specification, the point of fixity is \narbitrarily considered to be located at a distance from the pole butt, which is equal to 7% \nof the pole length. This value seems to work quite well over a range of pole lengths and is \napproximately the same value as a point of fixity located at 1/3 of the distance below the \ngroundline based on an embedment depth of 10% of the pole length + 2'.  \n \nThe reinforcing steel required at the point of fixity is required to continue to the pole butt. \nHowever, due to the loss of prestressing steel strength near the pole butt, the ultimate \nmoment capacity near the pole butt will be reduced. \n \nTip Loading (Section 4.1.2) \n \nThe tip loading is used to develop a required ultimate moment capacity diagram at any \npoint along the pole from 2' below the pole tip down to the point-of-fixity. This ultimate \nmoment capacity is determined by multiplying the tip load by the moment arm based on a \nsimple cantilever. As a result, the required ultimate moment diagram is linear in shape. \nThis same method may be utilized in structural analysis and automated transmission line"

They should be considered during the analysis of the actual loading \nconditions applied to the concrete pole. Typically, this type of analysis should be \naccomplished by nonlinear structural analysis techniques. Since the electrical clearances \nmust be assured in the operation of transmission lines, deflections must remain within an \nacceptable range.  \n \nThis specification limits the allowable pole deflection to 15% of the pole height above the \npoint of fixity when the tip load specified in Section 4.1.2 is applied under a horizontal \ntesting procedure under short term loading conditions. Long term loading will cause \ncontinued deflection due to the plastic deformation of the concrete. \n \nThe owner should recognize that the actual pole deflection for an application will be less \nthan the specified deflection limit of 15% of the pole height. With the standard class pole, \nall of the loading is applied near the pole tip. In a typical transmission line application, \nthe actual horizontal loading will be some distance from the pole tip. As such, the actual \ndeflection at the conductor under short term ultimate loading conditions can be expected \nto be less than 10% of the height above ground. \n \nThis specification also limits the allowable pole deflection to 5% of the pole height above \nthe point of fixity when 40% of the tip load specified in Section 4.1.2 is applied under a \nhorizontal testing procedure under long term loading conditions. This 40% loading \napproximates the unfactored NESC loading conditions as is discussed in the commentary \non cracking strength. \n \nThe NESC requires that electrical clearances be maintained under a wind loading of 6 \npsf. It is expected that the deflection of a standard class pole under this 6 psf loading \ncondition will be less than 3% of the height above ground. \n \nFor situations where the owner wishes to know the deflection for a standard class pole, \nthe owner should use a suitable structural analysis computer program in which the actual \ndesign loading conditions and concrete pole properties are input into the program. \nAnother option would be to ask the pole manufacturer to provide the analysis.  \n \nIf the owner has special deflection limitations, it is recommended that RUS Bulletin \n1724E-206, Guide Specification for Prestressed Concrete Pole and Concrete Pole \nStructures, be utilized instead of this specification.

Under this standard class concrete pole specification, these \nservice loads are not specified, but are considered to be 40% of the specified ultimate \nloads. \n \nFor concrete poles designed within the limits of this specification, the predominant pole \nloading will be transverse wind loads. The service load is determined based on the ratio \nof the transverse load factor. The NESC load factor applied to district wind loads is 2.5. \nAs such, the service load will be equal to the ultimate load divided by 2.5, or 40% of the \nultimate load.  \n \nFor typical concrete pole designs, initial cracking occurs at about 40-55 percent of the \nultimate strength of the pole. Therefore, the requirement for the cracking strength to be at \nleast 40% of the required ultimate strength should not cause the pole to be stronger than \nwhen considering ultimate strength alone.  \n \nSince it may be theoretically possible to have a cracking strength at less than 40% of the \nultimate strength, it is not desirable to do so. By requiring the cracking strength to exceed \n40% of the required ultimate strength, the owner is assured of an adequate cracking \nstrength for the standard class concrete pole. \n \nZero Tension Strength (Section 4.1.6) \n \nThe zero tension strength is defined as the moment at which a crack that was previously \ncreated by exceeding the cracking moment strength will open again. Under this condition, \nan applied moment will not cause any tensile stress in the concrete. \n \nIt is important to avoid open cracks in situations of significant unbalanced lateral loading \nand in extremely corrosive environments in order to protect the steel reinforcing. Typical \nstructures with permanent unbalanced lateral loads are unguyed angle and unguyed \ndeadend structures. While the design of these structure types is generally outside the \nrecommended scope of this specification, this specification does require a minimum zero \ntension strength for all pole classes. \n \nIt has been demonstrated that the zero tension strength will typically be 70% to 85% of \nthe cracking strength. With a minimum cracking strength of 40% of ultimate, 70% of this \nvalue would be equal to 28% of ultimate. Thus, it is natural for all concrete poles to have \na zero tension strength of at least 28% of ultimate. As such, this specification requires the \nstandard class concrete pole to have a zero tension strength exceeding 28% of the \nrequired ultimate strength."

A typical situation \nwhere the owner may wish to do this is when the owner uses a transmission line design \ncomputer program in which zero tension strength values are input for each pole type. \n \nThe owner should recognize that the zero tension strength for most concrete poles is \ngreater than the minimum required strength of 28% of the ultimate strength. In fact, the \nzero tension strength can be as high as 50% of the ultimate strength. Thus, for concrete \npole applications which must be designed for the zero tension strength requirements, such \nas unguyed or unbalanced lateral loadings, it is quite possible for the owner to obtain the \nconcrete pole at a significantly lesser cost by submitting the actual loading conditions to \nthe manufacturer using RUS Bulletin 1724E-206. \n \nFoundation Rotation and Deflection \n \nAlthough significant foundation rotation and deflection criteria are considered to be \nbeyond the scope of this standard class concrete pole specification, some allowances can \nbe made for these effects. They should be considered during the owner\u2019s analysis of the \nactual loading conditions to apply to the concrete pole.

In this case, the \ndesign of the structure based on zero tension strength is emphasized. (Refer to the \nCommentary regarding Zero Tension Strength.) \n \nBecause concrete poles are flexible structures, there may be a reduction in induced \nmoments in a pole under some types of longitudinal loads due to the restraining effect of \nthe overhead ground wires.  Traditionally, static longitudinal loads are specified due to \nthe complexity of calculating the influence of structure flexibility. \n \nGuy Wires \n \nIt is generally beyond the scope of this standard class concrete pole specification to \nconsider guy wires in the design of the structure.

Once the wood pole \nclass is determined, a standard class concrete pole could be selected based on an \nequivalency. In this case, it is recommended that the 1:1 equivalency ratio be utilized. It \nis generally agreed that a concrete pole has a greater buckling strength than an \nequivalently classed wood pole; therefore, the selected concrete pole class should be \nadequate for a situation in which a wood pole would normally be specified. The owner \nshould use caution in using this equivalency method and its usage should be prudently \ninfluenced by the owner\u2019s experience in similar applications where actual design loadings \nwere utilized under similar guying conditions. \n \nAny time a concrete pole structure is guyed, the guy type, size, modulus of elasticity and \nguy slope or angle has to be determined by the owner and properly modeled in the \nanalysis of the concrete structure. As is required by RUS Bulletin 1724E-206, the load in \nthe guy wire should be limited to 65 percent of its ASTM rated breaking strength under \nactual ultimate loading conditions.  The concrete pole and guy wire(s) must be designed \nas a system.  \nThe guy modulus of elasticity can increase from a minimum value at the time of \nmanufacture, to a maximum value, which results from periodic stretching and relaxing \nduring the load cycles. Ranges from 19,000 ksi to 28,000 ksi have been stated. The \nASCE steel pole specification (ASCE Manual 72) has suggested a guy wire modulus of \nelasticity of 23,000 ksi be used by the engineer whenever it is not specified. \n \nGroundline \n \nThe location of the groundline for the standard class pole should be specified on the \nowner\u2019s drawings. \n \nWhile the strength of the standard class pole is not effected by the groundline location, \nthe proper placement of climbing devices, ground wire clips, cant hole, vent hole, name \nplate, and so forth, depends upon the location of the groundline. \n \nIn addition, the ultimate moment capacity at the groundline is to be noted on the \nmanufacturer\u2019s drawings (see Section 7.2.5) and stamped on the pole name plate (see \nSection 4.12.1). \n \nAir Entrainment in Concrete Poles (Section 4.2) \n \nThe general effects of air entrainment are to increase workability, decrease density (unit \nweight), decrease strength, reduce bleeding and segregation, and increase durability. \n \nAn air content of 5% plus or minus 1% is required by ASTM C935 for statically cast \npoles \u201cunless otherwise specified\u201d. The owner should refer to ACI 318, Section 4.4 for \nconcrete exposed to freezing and thawing.

For a spun concrete pole, \nthe spinning process creates a very dense concrete and counteracts the air entrainment \neffects.  Since pumping occurs prior to the pole being spun, the air entrainment effects \nare present during the fabrication of spun poles.  The percentage of air entrained in a spun \nconcrete pole after it is spun is unknown.  However, it is believed poles that have \nconcrete containing an air entrainment agent will have a higher void ratio than those \nwithout this agent.  The owner has to be aware that as the percentage of air entrainment \nincreases the concrete strength decreases. \n \nCross-Sectional Shape (Section 4.3) \n \nConcrete poles can be manufactured in many different shapes, depending upon each \nmanufacturer\u2019s equipment and capabilities. Some shapes are more conducive than others \nwhen it comes to bolt hole orientation and hardware fit.  \n \nFor example, if the owner allows a square pole shape, it would be difficult to install \nthrough holes in a direction other than on the pole flats which are 90\u00b0 apart. Even with \nholes installed out of the flat plane, the hardware fit would be cumbersome at best. \nDepending on the manufacturer and situation, some poles can be made with blockouts \nthat create a type of flat over a short distance to allow the hardware to be properly \nattached. For 12-sided poles, the flats are 30\u00b0 apart which lends itself to better hole \norientation. Even with round cross-sections, there can be some deviation in the specified \nhole orientation due to longitudinal reinforcement placement.  \n \nBecause of these issues, the owner should specify in the Application Requirements which \npole shapes are acceptable for each structure. The owner should also specify the \nallowable angular tolerance on the hole orientation as this can significantly impact the \nmanufacturing process and cost. For example, if a deadend structure is to be installed at a \ncenterline survey line angle of 50\u00b0, is a hole orientation of 60\u00b0 acceptable if that is at the \ncenter of a flat or between longitudinal stranding?  \n \nGrounding (Section 4.5) \n \nThe advantages of an external ground wire include the following: (1) it is visible and can \nbe inspected, (2) hardware can be easily bonded and inspected, (3) it can be easily \nrepaired or replaced, and (4) potentially offers the benefit of suffering less damage from \nlightning strike (particularly in areas with high isokeraunic levels). For these reasons, \nexternal ground wires are preferred in this specification.  \n \nIf these specifications are altered to allow internal ground wires, then the following \nshould be addressed adequately: (1) requiring grounding lugs at hardware attachments, \n(2) requiring grounding lugs at pole top and groundline (for external ground electrode), \n(3) considering the possibility of damage from lightning strike, and (4) considering \ngrounding requirements for maintenance workers."

In \nseveral locations, concrete poles are to replace wood pecker damaged wood poles.  The \nexisting damaged poles are 80 ft class 1 wood poles with the TUS pole top assembly.  \nDetermine which standard size concrete pole should be used to replace the wood pole.  \nExtreme wind design load is 20.7 psf (90 mph).  The line is located in the heavy loading \ndistrict.  The conductor is 795 ACSR Drake and the overhead groundwire is 3/8\" HSS. \n \nNESC heavy district loads with a strength factor of .65 and a load factor of 2.5 controlled the \ndesign of the original wood pole line.  However, a quick comparison of the unit loads for the \nextreme wind and the NESC heavy district load with load factors and strength factors for \nconcrete, indicates that the extreme wind load will control the design of the concrete pole.1  \nBecause the extreme wind case controls design of the concrete replacement pole, the engineer \nmay use Table A-2 for convenience. \n \nTable A-2 indicates that for a class 1 wood pole, a C03.5 may be used.  There may be other \nissues in matching classes of wood poles to concrete poles that the engineer may need to \nconsider.  This example, however, shows the importance of determining the loading condition \nthat controls the design of the concrete pole.  If the engineer had assumed that the NESC heavy \ndistrict load controlled design of the concrete pole replacement since it controlled the design of \nthe wood pole when initially installed, then Table A-1 would have been mistakenly used and a \nS02.9 would have been selected as the replacement pole. \n \n \n \n \n \n \nNote 1: Unit loads for extreme wind is 1.9113 lbs/ft, or 2.102 with a 1.1 LF and for the NESC heavy district load, \nthe unit load is 1.7567 lbs/ft with a 2.5 LF."
