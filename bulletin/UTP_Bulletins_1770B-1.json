These accounts reflect, to the extent feasible, those functions. For example, the primary bases of the accounts containing the investment in telecommunications plant are the functions performed by the assets. In addition, because of the anticipated effects of future innovations, the telecommunications plant accounts are intended to permit technological distinctions. Similarly, the primary bases of plant operations, customer operations and corporate operations expense accounts are the functions performed by individuals. The revenue accounts, on the other hand, reflect a market perspective of natural groupings based primarily upon the products and services purchased by customers.",
    "account_structure_alternatives": "(c) In the course of developing the bases for this account structure, several other alternatives were explored. It was, for example, determined that because of the variety and continual changing of various costs allocation mechanisms, the financial accounts of a company should not reflect an a priori allocation of revenues, investments or expenses to products or services, jurisdictions or organizational structures. (Note also ù32.14 (c) and (d) of Subpart B). It was also determined that costs (in the case of assets) should not be recorded based solely upon physical attributes such as location, description or size.",

Whereas in the past specific organizations may have performed specific functions, the future environment with its increasing mechanization and other changes will result in entirely new or restructured organizations. Thus, any relationships drawn between organizations and accounts would become increasingly meaningless with the passage of time.",
