The capacitor bank is charged to the test voltage and then discharged through the forming resistor and test sample. The test sample will be considered to have passed the test if there is no distinct change in the wave shape obtained with the initial reduced voltage compared to that obtained after the application of the test voltage.",

    "Test_Procedure": "Using a suitable tool, expose enough of sheath slitting cord to permit grasping with needle nose pliers.",
    "Specimen_Temperature": "The prepared test specimens shall be maintained at a temperature of 23 ± 1°C for at least 4 hours immediately prior to and during the test.",
    "Cord_Wrap": "Wrap the sheath slitting cord around the plier jaws to ensure a good grip.",
    "Cable_Grasp": "Grasp and hold the cable in a convenient position while gently and firmly pulling the sheath slitting cord longitudinally in the direction away from the cable end. The angle of pull may vary to any convenient and functional degree. A small starting notch is permissible.",
    "Acceptable_Cord": "The sheath slitting cord is considered acceptable if the cord can slit the jacket and/or shield for a continuous length of 0.6 m (2 ft) without breaking the cord."
