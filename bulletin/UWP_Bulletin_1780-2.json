  "Short-Lived Assets": "Short-lived assets (SLA) are items that require periodic replacement prior to the end of a project's useful life. They do not include items covered by O&M or items that are usually funded with long-term capital financing. The short-lived asset table in Appendix A of the Interagency Memorandum contains a list of examples of short-lived assets. Depending on local practices and applicants, some of these items may not be considered short-lived assets if they are considered part of O&M or long-term capital financing. Consulting engineers and applicants should coordinate with each other and with the Agency to determine which items should be considered short-lived assets for specific projects. For Rural Development underwriting purposes, only assets with life spans of 15 years or less will be considered SLAs. Note that the list of SLAs provided for underwriting purposes may differ from the SLA list provided for the alternatives analysis. A list of SLAs for the entire system are needed for funding underwriting whereas only a list of SLAs relevant to project is needed for the alternatives analysis.",
  "Cyber Security": "The projected operation and maintenance (O&M) budget must include a line item for cyber security costs (see Appendix C), even if it is zero, but applicants are encouraged to enter into a cyber security contract.",
  "Collaborative Delivery Methods": "The PER guidance within this Bulletin assumes the use of standard design-bid-build method of project delivery. If collaborative methods are used (such as design build – stipulated price) the PER should be written and developed with this method in mind. Cost opinions will likely have different cost breakouts, particularly for engineering and construction related services. In some situations, an alternatives analysis may not be necessary if a project includes a request for proposals allowing competing design builders to present alternative designs. Use of collaborate delivery methods requires approval of the Agency and the Agency's Office of General Counsel. Project schedules should account for this effort.",
  "Sole Sourcing Equipment": "Sole sourcing equipment and materials is generally not allowed by 2 CFR 200.319. Projects wishing to sole source equipment must obtain Agency approval. Sole sourced equipment must conform with applicable domestic preference requirements.",
  "Amendments": "In certain situations, a previously concurred with PER may require modification due to unforeseen circumstances that affect the scope of work needed to complete the project objectives. In such cases, an amendment to the PER, that clearly demonstrates the PER modifications, may be submitted for agency review, consideration and concurrence. This amendment will be an official document, stamped and signed by the engineer of record.",
  "PER Finalized": "The PER is not finalized until the agency has concurred with the document. Any modifications made to the PER prior to agency concurrence should be made within the original document.",
  "PER Amendments": "PER amendments are rare after funding obligation and cannot be accepted after bids are opened for all contracts within the original project scope."

PRELIMINARY ENGINEERING REPORT OPTIONS", "PER Template Options Description": "The four PER template options available for WEP funded projects are described below. Not every template is suitable for every situation or project. Please read the details below to see which templates are allowed for a particular project in consideration. Irrespective of the template used, the PER must be sealed by an engineer licensed in the state where the project will be constructed.", "Option 1": "3.1 OPTION 1 - INTERAGENCY PER TEMPLATE", "Interagency PER Template Details": "Government at both state and federal levels endeavor to improve coordination between funding agencies in the processes involved in applications for infrastructure funding. A GAO report, \"Rural Water Infrastructure: Additional Coordination Can Help Avoid Potentially Duplicative Application Requirements” (GAO-13-111), released October 16, 2012, called the effort of the working group led by USDA to develop the attached Interagency PER Template “encouraging\" and stated that it would \"help communities”. In 2012 the USDA, Rural Development (RD), Rural Utilities Service (RUS), Water and Environmental Programs (WEP) formed a working group to develop an interagency template for PERs for use by both federal agencies and state administering agencies. The USDA-led working group included 36 individuals representing 4 federal agencies, 16 state agencies, the Border Environment Cooperation Commission, and the North Carolina Rural Center. Also, the effort was supported by the Small Community Water Infrastructure Exchange. On January 16, 2013, the principals of the federal participants executed an interagency memorandum supporting use of the interagency template, attached as Exhibit One.", "Content of Interagency PER": "Content of an Interagency PER: The attached Interagency PER Template describes the content of a PER and should be used without modification, unless noted otherwise. Often an applicant will initially consider only a single funding source and later determine that an application to additional funding agencies is necessary. To avoid having to revise the PER to meet the additional agencies' needs, the consulting engineer should provide responses to all sections of PER outline, unless specific sections do not apply to a proposed project.", "Funding Decision Data": "Requirements for providing funding decision (financial) data are integrated within the body of this template. The PER preparer may elect to provide this data within the body of the report or use Appendix C.", "Interagency PER Template Use": "The Interagency PER Template may be used for all WEP-funded projects and may be particularly helpful when other federal funding programs are contributing to the project financing.", "Option 2": "3.2 OPTION 2 – WEP-SPECIFIC PER TEMPLATE"}

Complete but concise PERs should be developed when utilizing this template. The WEP-Specific PER Template is provided in Exhibit Two.", "Option 3": "3.3 OPTION 3 \u2013 OTHER ENGINEERING REPORT WITH CROSS-REFERENCES", "Capital Improvement Plans and Engineering Reports": "Capital improvement plans and engineering reports prepared for other agencies may be used if those reports include the information described in the Option 1 or Option 2 templates, described above. To use this option, the location of the necessary information must be identified. Three methods to do this cross-reference are: a) Writing the page numbers from the other engineering report onto the Option 1 or Option 2 table of contents to identify the locations of the respective information; b) Providing a letter that explains where the required information can be found within the other engineering report. A cross-reference table should be attached to this letter; c) Providing a copy of the table of contents from the other engineering report and notating upon it where the necessary information required by the Option 1 or Option 2 templates can be found.", "Required Information": "Required information not furnished in the other engineering report may be provided in a separate document, sealed by an engineer licensed in the state where the project will be constructed.", "Option 4": "3.4 OPTION 4 \u2013 STREAMLINED PER TEMPLATE (LIMITED USE)", "Streamlined PER Template Use": "The Streamlined PER Template may be used for simple projects when there are no technical alternatives to the proposed action. Appendix B provides a list of such projects for which this PER template may be used. Projects that apply for only loan funding (no grant) may also qualify for the Streamlined PER. Projects not fitting in one of these categories must use one of the other template alternatives. In rare circumstances, the State Engineer might request analysis of an alternative for projects listed in Appendix B. The Streamlined PER Template is provided in Exhibit Three."}

The construction subtotal should be separated out from the non-construction costs. Construction costs should reflect domestic preference requirements required by funding sources. The non- construction subtotal should be included and added to the construction subtotal to establish the total project cost. A reasonable and uninflated construction contingency should be added as part of the non-construction subtotal. Contingency greater than 10% of construction cost must be justified based on project-specific issues.
