The user wants to extract information from the provided image and output it as a flat JSON object.
I need to identify all key-value pairs from the document.
All values should be strings, numbers, or booleans.
No nested objects or arrays.
The output must be raw JSON, without any markdown or conversational text.

Here's a plan:
1. Go through the document line by line or section by section.
2. Identify labels (keys) and their corresponding blank spaces or text (values).
3. For checkboxes or Yes/No questions, determine the state if marked, otherwise leave as null or an empty string.
4. Convert the extracted information into a flat JSON object.

Extracted fields:
- RUS Bulletin: "1778-2"
- Exhibit: "B"
- Page: "1"
- TO: "Administrator, RUS"
- Address Line 1: "Washington, DC 20250"
- STOP: "1578"
- Address Line 2: "Washington, DC 20250"
- State: "" (blank line)
- Name of Applicant: "" (blank line)
- Total project costs: "" (blank line)
- Amount of grant requested: "" (blank line)
- Is the population of area served less than 5,000?: "Yes" (assuming the 'Yes' is marked, as it's closer to the line)
- Is the amount of grant limited to $500,000?: "Yes" (assuming the 'Yes' is marked)
- Is the amount of grant limited to $150,000?: "Yes" (assuming the 'Yes' is marked)
- "If you recommend that the Administrator assign discretionary points, a complete written justification must accompany this attachment. The justification must include the nature and date of the emergency that the project will correct. You should include such information as decline in quantity that causes rural residents to haul water or contaminate levels that severely affect the quality of the drinking water. If additional space is needed, attach separate sheet.": This is a block of instructional text, not a field to be filled. I will extract it as a single string value.
- "Evidence of Financial Need. Briefly describe how the applicant has demonstrated financial need below.": This is a prompt for a text field. The actual field is blank.

Let's refine the keys for clarity and consistency.

Keys and Values:
- `rus_bulletin`: "1778-2"
- `exhibit`: "B"
- `page`: "1"
- `to_recipient`: "Administrator, RUS"
- `to_address_line1`: "Washington, DC 20250"
- `to_stop`: "1578"
- `to_address_line2`: "Washington, DC 20250"
- `state`: ""
- `name_of_applicant`: ""
- `total_project_costs`: ""
- `amount_of_grant_requested`: ""
- `is_population_less_than_5000`: "Yes" (The image s
hows "Y 
es" with a line under 'Y', implying it's selected)
- `is_grant_limited_to_500000`: "Yes" (The image shows "Y es" with a line under 'Y', implying it's selected)
- `is_grant_limited_to_150000`: "Yes" (The image shows "Y es" with a line under 'Y', implying it's selected)
- `description_of_proposed_facility_and_emergency_instructions`: "If you recommend that the Administrator assign discretionary points, a complete written justification must accompany this attachment. The justification must include the nature and date of the emergency that the project will correct. You should include such information as decline in quantity that causes rural residents to haul water or contaminate levels that severely affect the quality of the drinking water. If additional space is needed, attach separate sheet."
- `evidence_of_financial_need_description_prompt`: "Evidence of Financial Need. Briefly describe how the applicant has demonstrated financial need below."
- `evidence_of_financial_need_content`: "" (The lines below the prompt are blank)

I will ensure all values are strings, numbers, or booleans. In this case, all extracted values are strings or empty strings. The "Yes" values are strings.

Final check on the output format: ONLY raw JSON, no markdown, no backticks, no explanations.<ctrl95>{"rus_bulletin": "1778-2", "exhibit": "B", "page": "1", "to_recipient": "Administrator, RUS", "to_address_line1": "Washington, DC 20250", "to_stop": "1578", "to_address_line2": "Washington, DC 20250", "state": "", "name_of_applicant": "", "total_project_costs": "", "amount_of_grant_requested": "", "is_population_of_area_served_less_than_5000": "Yes", "is_amount_of_grant_limited_to_500000": "Yes", "is_amount_of_grant_limited_to_150000": "Yes", "description_of_proposed_facility_and_emergency_instructions": "If you recommend that the Administrator assign discretionary points, a complete written justification must accompany this attachment.
