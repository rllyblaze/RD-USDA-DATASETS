    "1. GENERAL": "The function of plant accounting is to record the various elements of construction and retirement costs in a manner that satisfies the requirements of Part 32, the Federal Communications Commission's Uniform System of Accounts, as supplemented by 7 CFR Part 1770, Accounting Requirements for REA Telephone Borrowers (Part 1770), and to form the basis for recording plant additions and retirements.",
    "1.1": "The telecommunications plant accounts are designed to show the investment in the entity's tangible and intangible telecommunications plant that has an estimated service life of more than one year.",
    "1.2": "The account numbers used in this bulletin are subaccounted to four digits after the decimal place. The first two digits after the decimal place are used to satisfy the requirements of Part 32 and Part 1770.",

    "5.1 Retirement Work Order": "The number of property record units to be retired and the original installed cost of each should be entered in a section of the form entitled \"Units to be Retired\". By multiplying the unit cost by the quantities and adding the products, the total original cost of units retired is obtained. To complete the work order costing, the cost of removal and the salvage value of reusable material should be estimated.",
    "6. CONSTRUCTION WORK ORDERS": "A construction work order should accumulate, in one record, all costs assignable to a specific addition of telecommunications plant. The cost of all completed work orders should be cleared to the telecommunications plant accounts on a monthly basis.",
    "7. BLANKET WORK ORDERS": "In order to eliminate many small work orders, a system of blanket work orders may be used. Through the use of blanket work orders, many projects for which individual work orders were previously prepared may be merged, decreasing the number of work orders necessary to record plant changes.",
    "7.1 Normal Operations": "In normal operations, certain types of new construction and certain replacements of retirement units recur frequently due to the necessity of adding new subscribers and maintaining and improving service to existing subscribers. When it is not necessary to maintain a record of the individual costs of each job, blanket construction and retirement work orders are often used to accumulate the costs of similar jobs performed within a given period of time. Blanket work orders may be closed to plant on a quarterly basis.",
    "8. JOB ORDERS": "The term \"job order\" usually refers to maintenance activities chargeable to expense. The term, however, may be used to identify small construction jobs that are not considered large enough to require a separate work order. Under the blanket work order system, job order numbers may be assigned to individual construction projects covered by one blanket work order and maintenance job order numbers may be assigned to individual maintenance jobs.",
    "8.1 Job Order Use": "A job order is used to provide documentation for subscribers' requests for service and is not used to accumulate the costs of any associated construction or maintenance activity. The cost of construction related job orders should, therefore, be accumulated on a blanket work order.",

    "9.1.2": "When the replacement involves a minor item of property, the cost of replacing it is charged to the appropriate Plant Specific/Plant Nonspecific Operations Expense account.",
    "9.2": "To eliminate the need for many small work orders, blanket retirement work orders may be used. An individual or blanket retirement work order, as appropriate, should be prepared for all retirements consisting of retirement units.",
    "9.3": "When construction of plant also includes plant retirements, separate construction and retirement work orders should be prepared, cross-referenced, and listed on the same Summary of Work Orders, REA Form 771 (Exhibit M).",

As subsequent stages of the work order are completed, the completion dates are entered in the Work Order Register.

The quantity should be reported, by work order number, in the column under the appropriate description of the work performed. The \"Condition of Material\" removed should be reported as \"G\" if good and reusable, or as \"W\" if worthless or nonusable. Materials representing major components of property record units that have been abandoned should also be reported in this section.",
    "11.1.4 Motor Vehicle": "The foreman, or the individual workmen when working alone, should distribute the total hours a vehicle was used during the day under the same columnar heading on the Daily Work Report as the labor and material. If a vehicle made one trip to a job on which several types of work were performed, distribution of the vehicle time is made on the same basis as the direct labor hours for each type of work. This distribution should be made by the foreman or individual plant employees so that the accounting department can properly distribute costs.",
    "11.2 Payroll Distribution sheet": "The hours worked by each employee, as reported on the Daily Work Report (Exhibit B), should be posted to the individual employee's Payroll Distribution Sheet (Exhibit C) to calculate payroll and distribute labor costs to the appropriate accounts.",
    "11.2.1": "Although individual plant account numbers are shown on the Daily Work Report, all labor costs applicable to work order construction or retirement are charged first to the respective construction (2003.3000/2004.3000) and retirement work in progress (3100.X000) accounts.",
    "11.2.2": "Upon completion of the work order, the costs are then cleared to the appropriate telecommunications plant in service and accumulated depreciation accounts. Time chargeable to maintenance is distributed directly to the appropriate Plant Specific/Plant Nonspecific Operations Expense accounts on the Payroll Distribution Sheet.",

    "SAMPLE CASE": "The remainder of this bulletin focuses on a sample case that illustrates the work order procedure and demonstrates the relationship of the exhibits included in this lesson. The forms contained the attached exhibits are designed for both overhead and underground construction and retirement activities. This sample case, however, illustrates only overhead construction and retirement activities because the construction and retirement is less technical and, as a result, easier to understand and illustrate.",
    "17.1": "This sample case is designed solely for the purpose of illustrating the concepts relating to work order construction and to show the interrelationship of the various forms. This sample is not designed to indicate what REA will finance, nor is it designed to promote the use of a specific form. Only the REA forms that are referenced are required to be used, all other forms are provided for illustrative purposes only. REA telephone borrowers are free to design their own forms provided such forms contain sufficient information so as to allow for the proper accumulation and distribution of work order construction costs.",
    "17.2": "In this sample case, the Mill Valley Telecommunications Company replaced three pairs of aerial wire and extended a pole line and circuits to serve two new subscribers on Pine Street. The construction crew completed the job in two days. The construction was included in Blanket Construction Work Order No. B5 and the related retirement in Blanket Retirement Work Order No. B5X. The costs incurred replaced three pairs of aerial wire and six pair aerial distribution wire, extended the pole line, and added three pair distribution wire to serve two new subscribers.",
    "17.3": "In this case, REA is primarily concerned with the accounting for the costs of the Pine Street construction. The costs of other job orders included in the blanket work order, however, appear on some of the forms to demonstrate the manner in which the costs of material, labor, and overhead are determined when several job orders are involved. It should be noted that additional maintenance and line construction activities may have been performed on the same days as the Pine Street construction and that work on a particular job may cover longer periods of time."
