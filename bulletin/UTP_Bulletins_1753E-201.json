    "1.1": "The switching system acceptance tests specified in this bulletin should be made by the Owner or its Engineer before the equipment is placed into service or accepted for final payment. The acceptance test instructions, checklists, and guidance presented in this bulletin are based on the requirements of Part 1 of RUS Bulletin 1753E-001, \"General Specification for Digital, Stored Program Controlled Central Office Equipment (Form 522).\" Paragraph references in this bulletin refer to Bulletin 1753E-001, Part I, unless specifically stated otherwise. Although this bulletin was developed with new digital switches in mind, much of the material is also applicable for acceptance testing of additions and upgrades.",
    "1.2": "Certification should be obtained from the supplier that the equipment is ready for testing, and arrangements should be made with all connecting companies before starting any call tests. The configuration of system software and equipment and the complexity of operating and diagnostic tests make it desirable to conduct a number of these tests with the assistance of the equipment supplier's representative. The diversified design and applications of the various makes of digital switches require flexibility in the implementation of acceptance tests. Special considerations should be made for test processes on additions and upgrades to \"on-line\" systems on a case by case basis. Any acceptance test procedures provided by the switch supplier should be reviewed and used if deemed satisfactory.",
    "1.3": "In addition to the tests included in this bulletin the Owner or its Engineer should develop procedures and methods to test special features in the particular system.",
    "1.4": "Before any system acceptance tests are conducted, a physical inspection of the quality of workmanship and appearance of the installation should be made. This is to be followed by an inventory to ascertain that all required equipment has been installed.",

This is a two-trial test and should be considered the minimum sample size to be tested in a system. If the system passes Trial 1, Trial 2 is omitted. Table 1 is to be considered a minimum sample size for the number of subscriber lines in the office or trunks in trunk groups. A larger sample may be used if considered necessary.",

The originating calls should be directed to as many terminations and types of terminations as time permits.

The operator should be able to repeat this tone. Check that conversation with the operator, 911 or other emergency numbers is possible without depositing a coin. On local-to-local calls, check that the calling pay station cannot talk without deposit of coin after answer by the called party.

This is not likely to be the case; therefore, other methods should be used and the connecting company equipment simulated. For inward voice frequency trunk testing, a test set can be plugged into the line side jack of two-way or incoming trunks and the tests made inward on loop dial trunks. For E & M trunks, the E & M leads are to be accessed with the test set for signaling inward; and calls completed to a local line and or another trunk in case of tandem switching. In each case, a talking test should be made to ensure continuity.",
    "4.2.1": "If the trunks are direct digital connected and the connecting company is not ready for tests, a portable channel bank, or appropriate test equipment, can be used to simulate the distant end. The trunk should be pulsed with the proper mode. For dial pulse signaling, a simple telephone will suffice; but if MF signaling is required, an MF sending test set is needed.",

If this is not possible, access the busy verification trunk (or toll completing trunk) from the distant office end either by a portable channel bank if the trunk is direct digital connected or jack access if the trunk is VF.
