    "Qualification": "Sheath Slitting Cord Qualification",
    "Procedure Description": "The test procedures described in this appendix are for qualification of initial and subsequent changes in sheath slitting cords.",
    "Sample Selection": "All testing must be performed on two 1.2 m (4 ft) length of wire removed sequentially from the same 3 pair, 22 gauge jacketed wire. This wire must not have been exposed to temperatures in excess of 38°C since its initial cool down after sheathing.",
    "Test Procedure": "TEST PROCEDURE",
    "Tool Usage": "Using a suitable tool, expose enough of sheath slitting cord to permit grasping with needle nose pliers.",
    "Specimen Temperature": "The prepared test specimens shall be maintained at a temperature of 23 ± 1°C for at least 4 hours immediately prior to and during the test.",
    "Cord Wrapping": "Wrap the sheath slitting cord around the plier jaws to ensure a good grip.",
    "Wire Holding": "Grasp and hold the wire in a convenient position while gently and firmly pulling the sheath slitting cord longitudinally in the direction away from the wire end.",
    "Angle Variation": "The angle of pull may vary to any convenient and functional degree.",
    "Notch Permissibility": "A small starting notch is permissible.",
    "Acceptable Cord": "The sheath slitting cord is considered acceptable if the cord can slit the jacket and/or shield for a continuous length of 0.6 m (2 ft) without breaking the cord."

    "Qualification": "Thermal Reel Wrap Qualification",
    "Test Procedures Description": "The test procedures described in this appendix are for qualification of initial and subsequent changes in thermal reel wraps.",
    "Sample Selection": "All testing must be performed on two 450 mm (18 in.) lengths of wire removed sequentially from the same 3 pair, 22 gauge jacketed wire. This wire must not have been exposed to temperatures in excess of 38°C since its initial cool down after sheathing.",
    "Test Procedure": "TEST PROCEDURE",
    "Sample Placement": "Place the two samples on an insulating material such as wood, etc.",
    "Thermocouple Placement": "Tape thermocouples to the jackets of each sample to measure the jacket temperature.",
    "Sample Covering": "Cover one sample with the thermal reel wrap.",
    "Heat Exposure": "Expose the samples to a radiant heat source capable of heating the uncovered jacket sample to a minimum of 71°C. A 600 watt photoflood lamp or an equivalent lamp having the light spectrum approximately that of the sun shall be used.",
    "Lamp Height": "The height of the lamp above the jacket shall be 380 mm (15 in.) or a height that produces the 71°C jacket temperature on the unwrapped sample.",
    "Temperature Recording": "After the samples have stabilized at the temperature, the jacket temperatures of the samples must be recorded after one hour of exposure to the heat source.",
    "Temperature Difference Computation": "Compute the temperature difference between the jackets.",
    "Acceptance Criteria": "For the thermal reel wrap to be acceptable to REA, the temperature differences between the jacket with the thermal reel wrap and the jacket without the reel wrap must be greater than or equal to 17°C."
