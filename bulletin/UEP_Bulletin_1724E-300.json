    "content": "Bulletin 1724E-300\nPage 37\nCHAPTER 1\nINTRODUCTION\n1.1   PREFACE\nThis bulletin provide s design guidance for the increasing numbers of substations necessary to meet the\nincreasing electrical demands in areas served by Rural Utilities Service borrowers (here and after called\ncooperative s). This guide bulletin  is intended for the benefit of cooperative s, their consulting and staff\nengineers, and others interested in rural substation design and construction concerns and considerations.\nSubstations should be designed, constructed, and operated to meet customer s’ needs at the lowest possible\ncost commensurate with the quality of service desired.  The typical system may include substations for\nvoltage transformation, sectionalizing, distribution, and metering a number of times between generation\nand utilization.\n1.2  PURPOSE AND SCOPE\nThis bulletin covers rural transmission and distribution with air-insulated, outdoor substations 345 kV\n(phase-to-phase) and below.\nPossible design responsibilities of the engineer are covered, including preparation of construction\ndrawings, material, equipment and labor specifications, and any other engineering design services that\nmay be required.\nThe engineering function is generally more than furnishing of design and specifications.  Recognition of\nthis function becomes especially important when a c ooperative employs an engineering firm to\nsupplement its staff.  (See U.S. Code of Federal Regulations, Title 7, Part 1724 ( 7 CFR 1724 ), “Electric\nEngineering, Architectural Services and Design Policies and Procedures .”)  The contract between a\ncooperative  and an engineering firm should be clear in its definition of the engineering functions to be\nperformed.  Within this bulletin, it should be understood that the term “engineer” could mean either a\ncooperative ’s staff engineer(s) or a consultant’s engineer(s).\nThe engineer needs to use these guidelines together with experience and knowledge.  A list of references\nat the end of most chapters will aid in the search for more detailed information.   It is recommended that,\nwhere other resources are referenced, such as those of ANSI, IEEE, RUS, and ASTM, the substation\ndesigner obtain  and become familiar with the appropriate document.\nUse of this publication for substation design will usually result in an economical approach from a system\nstandpoint.  This should eventually result in the evolution of standard designs for a given system.\nStandardization is a desirable and achievable objective that should be pursued.\nTechnical advances and changes in codes and standards  that could cause some of the material in this\nbulletin to become obsolete  continue to proliferate in the electric power industry .  Users, therefore, need\nto continue their own efforts to stay up to date with the changing technologies.\n1.3 RELATIONSHIP OF SUBSTATION TO OVERALL POWER SYSTEM\nA substation is part of a system and not an entity to itself.  Normally, a power system is designed so that"

An\noutage of the bus results in a complete interrup -\ntion of power through the substation.  The\nengineer  will need to consider other equipment in\nthe substation, such as a transfer bus or different\nmulti-bus arrang ement.  The engineer should also\nevaluate the adjacent system to determine if the\nload can be diverted around the substation for\noutages  to minimize the equipment that is\ninstalled in a substation.the effects of an outage  (caused by the failure of a single component such as a transformer, transmission\nline, or distribution line)  will result in minimal interruption of service and affect the fewest customers\npossible.\nFailure of one component in a system often forces a greater than normal load to be carried by other\ncomponents of the system.  Such contingencies are normally planned for and incorporated into design\ncriteria.\nWhen evaluating the switching arrangement for a\nsubstation, an engineer needs to be aware of the\nsystem configuration of which the substation will\nbe a part.  System contingency arrangements need\nto permit the outage of components in a\nsubstation for maintenance and unscheduled\noutages.\nMost substations are designed to operate un-\nattended.  Remote indication, control, metering,\nand methods of communication are often\nprovided so that systems and portions of systems\ncan be monitored from a central point.\n1.4  IMPORTANCE OF ADEQUATE SUBSTATION PLANNING AND ENGINEERING\n(See Bulletins 1724D-101A, “Electric System Long-Range Planning Guide,” and 1724D-101B, “System\nPlanning Guide, Construction Work Plans.”)\nSubstation planning considers the location, size, voltage, sources, loads, and ultimate function of a\nsubstation.  If adequate planning is not followed , a substation may require unnecessary and costly\nmodification .\nThe engineer’s detailed work requires use of valid requirements and criteria, appropriate guidelines, and\nengineer’s  own expertise  in order  to provide construction drawings and associated documents  appropriate\nfor needed system improvements .  The engineer ’s ability to meld the diverse constraints into an\nacceptable design is essential.\nDuring the design phase, the engineer should avoid personal preferences  in solving technical problems\nthat diverge from the use of nationally accepted standards, Rural Utilities Service ( RUS) standards, or the\nconcept of the cooperative’s  standard designs.\nAdequate engineering design provides direction for construction, procurement of material and equipment,\nand future maintenance requirements while taking into account environmental, safety, and reliability\nconsiderations.\n1.5   TYPES OF SUBSTATIONS\n1.5 .1  General\nSubstations may be categorized as distribution substations, transmission substations, switching\nsubstations, or any combination thereof."

Further discussion\nrevealed the customer’s  definition of outage was\nany voltage drop  of 20 percent or more for more\nthan three  cycles.  The utility ’s definition of\noutage was any discontinuance of service after\nall reclosing of a feeder failed.   Differing usage\nof common terms resulted in unacceptable\nservice to the customer, requiring modifications\nto the installation.One design tendency is to reduce costs by reducing the number of substations and taking advantage of\neconomies of scale.  Conversely, practical system design and reliability considerations tend to include\nmany substations.   One function of system studies  is to balance these two viewpoints.\n1.5.2  Distribution Substations\nA distribution substation is a combination of\nswitching, controlling, and voltage step-down\nequipment arranged to reduce subtransmission voltage\nto primary distribution voltage for residential, farm,\ncommercial, and industrial loads.\nRural distribution substation capacities vary.\nSubstations generally include  one l.5 MVA to three\n5 MVA transformers .  These substations  may be\nsupplied radially, tapped from a subtransmission line,\nor may have two sources of supply.  Most\ncooperative s’ substations have 12,470Y/7200-volt or\n24,490Y/14,400-volt distribution circuits.\nA special class of distribution substation would\ninclude a dedicated customer substation.  This\nsubstation would be similar to a distribution substation\nexcept that all of its capacity would be reserved for the\nservice of one customer.  The secondary voltages of a\ndedicated substation would also be modified to match\nspecial requirements of the customer.  Coordination\nwith the customer is of primary importance in\ndetermining the technical requirements.  Confirmation of the technical terms being used is likely to be\nrequired since electrical engineers in differing industries may use the same terms to describe similar, yet\ntechnically different, criteria.\n1.5.3  Transmission Substations\nA transmission substation is a combination of switching, controlling, and voltage step-down equipment\narranged to reduce transmission voltage to subtransmission voltage for distribution of electrical energy to\ndistribution substations.  Transmission substations frequently have two or more large transformers.\nTransmission substations function as bulk power distribution centers, and their importance in the  system\noften justifies bus and switching arrangements that are much more elaborate than distribution substations.\n1.5.4  Switching Substations\nA switching substation is a combination of switching and controlling equipment arranged to provide\ncircuit protection and system switching flexibility.\nSwitching stations are becoming common on cooperative s’ transmission systems.  Flexible switching\narrangements in a transmission network can aid in maintaining reliable service under  certain  abnormal or\nmaintenance conditions."

These requirements s hould\nbe considered with the utilit y’s\nability to serve the load during  any\noutage.CHAPTER 2\nGENERAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS\n2.1  INITIAL AND ULTIMATE REQUIREMENTS\nCooperatives should consider both short- and long-range plans in the development of their systems.\nTimely development of plans is not only essential for the physical and financial integrity of electrical\nsystems , it is also essential in  supply ing customers with adequate service.\nThe long-range plan identifies the requirements of a\nsubstation not only for its initial use but also for some years\nin the future.  Consider ultimate requirements during  the\ninitial design .  Make e conomic comparisons  to discover what\nprovisions are necessary for ease of addition.\nRemember that development plans embrace philosophies  of\nequipment and system  operation and protection before\nconstruction is started.  Changes in the cooperative’s  standard design philosophies should be reviewed by\nthe personnel who design, operate, and maintain the proposed equipment.  Departures from standard\ndesigns c ould  jeopardize the operation of the system.\nUse the Substation Design Summary in Appendix B to  Chapter 3 to summarize basic design data.\n2.2   SITE CONSIDERATIONS\nTwo of the most critical factors in the design of a substation are its location and siting.  Failure to\ncareful ly consider  these factors  can result in excessive investment in the number of substations and\nassociated transmission and distribution facilities.\nIt is becoming increasingly important to perform initial site investigations prior to the procurement of\nproperty.  Previous uses of a property might render it very costly to use as a substation site.\nSuch previous uses might include its use as a dumping ground where buried materials or toxic waste has\nto be removed prior to any grading or installation of foundations.\nThe following factors should be evaluated when selecting a substation site:\na. Location of present and future load center\nb. Location of existing and future sources of power\nc. Availability of suitable right-of-way and access to site by overhead or underground\ntransmission and distribution circuits\nd. Alternative land use considerations\ne. Location of existing distribution lines\nf. Nearness to all-weather highway and railroad siding, accessibility to heavy equipment under all\nweather conditions , and access roads into the site\ng. Possible objections regarding appearance, noise, or electrical effects\nh. Site maintenance requirements including equipment repair, watering, mowing, landscaping,\nstorage, and painting\ni. Possible objections regarding present and future impact on other private or public facilities"

It also references additional authorities,\ndirectives, and instructions relevant to protection of the environment.\nAs a general rule, substations requiring greater than 2 hectares (5 acres) of new physical disturbance need\nan Environmental Assessment (EA), while those below generally require an Environmental Report (ER)\n(see RUS Bulletins 1794A-600, “Guide for Preparing an Environmental Report for Categorically\nExcluded Projects” and 1794-601, “Guide for Preparing an Environmental Report for Electric Projects\nRequiring an Environmental Assessment”).\n2.3.1.2  Appearance:  Appearance is becoming increasingly important to the public.  In some areas,\nzoning regulations and suggestions by civic organizations often mean screening, low-profile designs, or\nother measures to improve appearance.  The absence of such direct influence in rural areas should not be\na reason for not considering newer design practices.  The general trend is to locate substations in a way\nthat they are not strikingly visible to the public.  A substation set back from a heavily traveled road may\nrequire little or no architectural treatment to be acceptable.\nCoordinate engineering of transmission, distribution, and substation facilities to develop the least overall\nobjectionable layout.

Lowering of the substation profile may also be accomplished by means other than underground\ncircuits although this approach may necessitate a larger surface area, resulting in larger site requirements .\nLower profile designs for substation high -voltage equipment may be cost -effective in design  and in\nreducing the profile that the substation projects.\nLandscaping or architectural screening may offer effective means to blend a substation into the\nsurrounding environment.   Landscaping has typically included the use of trees, bushes , and the like to\nscreen the substation.  In some cases, masonry  walls or enclosures have been necessary to meet permitting\nrequir ements in special use areas.   Some sites may provide a natural screening with either vegetation  or\nnatural barriers.\nGenerally, it is better to use complementary rather than contrasting colors.  Sometimes, coloring can be\nused to blend substation equipment into the background.\nOutdoor lighting of the substation site  may have an effect on the acceptance of the substation in a\ncommunity .  Lighting is typically a means to deter  vandalism.  It also provides safety for line crews who\nmay be performing maintenance at night.  A means of switching off a portion of the lights at night to\nprovide reduced lighting may make  the site more accepta ble to the community.\n2.3.1.3   Public Safety:   Substations should be safe for people who may have occasion to be near them.\nThe primary means of ensuring public safety at substations is by the erection of a suitable barrier such as\na metal fence.  Unless local restrictions are more conservative, the fence needs to meet the minimum\nrequirements specified in the National Electrical Safety Code  and IEEE Std . 1119, “IEEE Guide for\nFence Safety Clearances. ”  (RUS recommends 8 feet for the fence height: 7 feet of fabric and a 1-foot\nextension of barbed wire.)  Metal fences have to be properly grounded; grounding of fences is covered in\nChapter 9.  Material and specification of fences is covered in Chapter 6, Section 6.9 .\nAdditional means of protecting the public are provided through adequate design of all facilities inside the\nfence and the addition of a peripheral ground outside the fence.  Protection that alleviates possible\npotential differences is discussed in Chapter 9.\nAppropriate warning signs should be posted on the substation’s peripheral barrier fence.  The engineer\nshould specify their location and design.  Substations , no matter how small , should have one sign per side ,\nas a minimum.   For each substation site , assess whether  standard signs are sufficient.  Special bilingual\nsigns may be advisable  for some areas.  Additional signs, such as “No Trespassing, ” may be advisable in\nsome areas.   See ANSI Std. Z535.2, “Environmental and Facility Safety Signs,” for further information.\n2.3.1.4   Audible Noise :  Sources of audible noise within a substation include transformers, voltage\nregulators, circuit breakers, and other intermittent noise generators.  Among the sources, transformers\nhave the greatest potential for producing objectionable noise.  The design engineer should consider\naudible noise reference documents and regulations.\nCorona, which is localized incomplete dielectric failure, causes a hissing sound.  Corona noise occurring\nat voltages of 230 kV and below is seldom serious.  Corona noise is usually kept to a tolerable level if\nguidelines for minimizing electrical effects are followed.   Design for 345  kV systems will normally\nrequire extra-high-voltage ( EHV ) connectors and fittings or corona shields to reduce the amount of noise\nfrom corona to tolerable levels."

Once a transformer is located, its noise level at any distance\ncan be estimated by using standard formula s.  See  IEEE Std . 1127 , “IEEE Guide for the Design,\nCons truction, and Operation of Electric Power Substations for Community Acceptance and\nEnvironmental  Compatibility ,” for formulas that may be used .  If noise is anticipated to be a problem,\nreduced sound levels are available from the transformer manufacturer or the equipment layout should be\narranged to permit the installation of a sound barrier. Anticipated future requirements should also be\nconsidered since additional transformers will increase the noise level.\n2.3.1.4.3   Level :  As a general rule, substation noise will not be a problem if, when combined with\nambient noise, it is less than 5 dBA above the ambient noise level.  It may be desirable to measure the\nambient noise levels at locations of concern.  Measurements should be taken during the quietest periods,\napproximately midnight to 4 a.m.  Calculation of the resultant sound level will then indicate whether\nfurther study is required.  The references at the end of this chapter suggest methods to rigorously address\nnoise problems.\n2.3.1.4.4   Transformers :  Chapter 5, Section 5.2, “Power Transformers” provides additional guidelines.\n2.3.1.5   Electrostatic and Electromagnetic Effects:   Consideration should be given to preventing radio\nand television interference that could result from visible corona.  Significant corona could be caused by\nenergized parts having small radii or from small-diameter conductors, particularly when conductive\nclimatic conditions prevail.  Experience has shown, though, that conductor fittings and energized parts\nother than conductors do not produce serious corona at phase-to-phase voltages of 230 kV and below.   At\n345 kV, electrical voltage gradients are such that corona shields  and connectors designed to mitigate\ncorona  should  be used .\nIt is necessary, however, to consider  the size of conductors.  Chapter 4, “Physical Layout,” provides\nguidelines for fault and load-carrying conductors .  Connections to equipment such as voltage transformers\nand coupling capacitors should not be sized from a current-carrying standpoint only.  From a corona\nstandpoint, conductors should not be smaller than 3/0 at 230 kV or 1/0 at 161 kV and 138 kV.   At 345  kV,\nequipment jumpers should consist of bundled conductors.\n2.3.1.6   Effluent:   40 CFR 110 and 112 provide  regulations to eliminate the pollution of navigable\nwaterways.  The essence of these regulations is that, upon  the failure of a contain er filled with  a pollutant,\nsuch as oil in a transformer or oil circuit breaker , no harmful  quantity of such pollutant  (oil)  may be\nallowed to enter a navigable waterway.  Absolute  prevention and containment of oil spills is not required\nby the regulations;  however , the discharge of harmful quantities of pollutants into navigable waterways is\nprohibite d.  The regulations and interpretations thereof are dynamic.   It is necessary to have a Spill\nPrevention Control and Countermeasures (SPCC) plan of action for disposing of effluent, should spills or\nleaks occur. Some oil pollution prevention measures are described in Chapter 8 and in RUS Bulletin\n1724E-302, “Design Guide for Oil Spill Prevention and Control at Substations.”  If more than 5.0 acres of\nland will be disturbed during construction, a stormwater discharge permit has to be obtained from the\nappropriate state agency prior to the start of construction.  See the above -mentioned C FR regulations and\nIEEE Std . 980, “IEEE Guide for Containment and Control of Oil Spills in Substations ,” for assistance in\ndetermining the appropriateness of in-place structures and items to be included in a n SPCC plan."

This type of impregnant has been phased out, because of its resistance\nto biodegradation, in favor of materials potentially less harmful to the environment.\n2.3.2  Weather\n2.3.2.1   General :  As dependence on the use of electricity grows, it is increasingly important that\nsubstations operate more reliably in extremes of weather than in the past.\n2.3.2.2   Temperature :  It is necessary to design a substation for the extreme temperatures expected.\nExtreme temperatures could affect circuit breakers, relay protection, or the bus.\n2.3.2.3   Wind:   As a minimum, substations should be resistant to wind velocities as shown in\nFigure  2-1.  Chapter  4, “Physical Layout, ” and Chapter 7, “Structures, ” provide specific guidelines on\ndesign.  Local conditions may dictate more stringent wind designs.\n2.3.2.4   Ice:  A substation should  continue to operate despite ice accumulation.  Generally, consensus\nequipment standards specify ice loadings for both electrical and mechanical withstands .  The complete\nsubstation assembly should  also be undamaged by ice accumulation.  From  the ice accumulation history\nfor a given substation ’s location, the engineer can judge whether more severe loadings than consensus\nequipment standards are necessary.  Additional viewpoints on ice loading are provided  in Chapter 4 ,\n“Physical Layout, ” and Chapter 7, “Structures. ”\n2.3.2.5   Rain :  A substation should be designed to be operable under predictable conditions of rainfall.\nAdditionally, it is desirable that substation drainage be sufficient enough to  exhibit little standing water\nwithin a few hours after a heavy rainfall.  See Chapter 6 , “Site Design, ” for guidelines.\n2.3.2.6   Snow :  Snow introduces an extremely variable hazard to substations because of uncertainties in\ndrifting and accumulation.  The substation has to  be impervious to snow damage, and consideration needs\nto be given to snow accumulation and the maintenance of clearances.  The engineer should seek local data\non this weather variable.\n2.3.2.7   Electrical Storms :  The two measures normally employed for  substation  lightning protection\nare surge arresters and shielding.  Application guidelines for surge arresters are included  in Chapters 4\nand 5 .  Surge arresters provide little protection against direct strokes.  Shielding is provided by overhead\nwires, masts that are extensions of structures, or independent masts as covered in Chapter 4 .  A\ncombination of surge arresters and shielding will reduce the probability of damage from lightning.\n2.3.2.8  Humidity :  Consideration should be given to installation of differential thermostat -controlled\nheating in outdoor cabinets such as circuit breaker control cabinets where condensation could be a\nproblem.  In areas where fog occurs often , and particularly where airborne contamination exists, frequent\ninsulator flashovers may occur.  Methods of reducing flashovers include the application of special\ninsulation and insulator cleaning.\n2.3.3  Altitude\nEquipment that depends on air for its insulating and cooling medium will have a higher temperature rise\nand a lower dielectric strength when operated at higher altitudes; see ANSI Std.

The\nprimary means of protection is the perimeter barrier.  This is generally a chain link fence that keeps out\nlarger animals.  It may also be necessary to have rodent and/or reptile barriers.  It is recommended that all\nsubstation materials be non-nutrients, since impregnable barriers would be too difficult to attain.  Insect\nscreening should be applied where local experience indicates  it is beneficial .  Avoiding attractive nesting\nand perching sites usually minimizes bird damage.

Other utility concerns include but are not limited to:\n1. Telecommunications\n2. Cable television\n3. Water and sewer\n4. Gas\n5. Radio and television stations\nThere should be little difficulty ensuring proper substation interfacing with distribution, subtransmission,\nand transmission lines.  Timely plans should be made so there is mutual agreement between the substation\nengineer and the various line engineers on the following:\n1. Connecting hardware procurement responsibility\n2. Mating of hardware to line support structure\n3. Line identifications and electrical connections to suit planning engineering requirements\n4. Substation orientation and line approach\n5.

In some cases, line\ntensions on the line side of a line approach or deadend structure will be much greater than on the line\nsupport structure in the substation.  The substation engineer  should  specify  the tension that will result in\nthe maximum  load  on the substation line support structure with the wire under the most severe\ncombination of temperature, wind , and ice loading.  The condition at which maximum tension occurs has\nto be known in order to select  appropriate  overload factors.  Chapter 7, “Structures, ” covers overload\nfactor selection.\nAs a general rule, takeoff tensions should not exceed 8900 newtons (2000 pounds) per conductor for\nsmall distribution substations.   However, the incoming transmission line alignment, wire size, and\nelevation differences can increase the required tensions.\n2.5 RELIABILITY CONSIDERATIONS\nA prime objective in the operation of an electric power system is to provide reliable service within\nacceptable voltage limits.  Information on reliability may be found in ANSI  Std.

These regulations are included in 29 CFR 1910 for general industry and\n29 CFR 1 926 for construction.  In addition, various states may have standards the same as or stricter than\nthose of OSHA.  The engineer is expected to follow the regulations appropriate to the jurisdiction in\nwhich a substation is built.\nIt should be recognized that this bulletin presents substation design guidance information only and not\ndetailed regulatory provisions, especially related to safety.  The engineer is responsible for researching\nand ensuring substations are designed in compliance with the applicable requirements of RUS, the\nNational Electrical Safety Code , National Electrical Code , OSHA, and local regulations.  The engineer is\nalso responsible for analyzing expected local conditions, and, where warranted, including provisions in\nsubstation designs beyond the minimum provisions for safety established in the various regulatory codes.\n2.8 MAINTENANCE CONSIDERATIONS\nSubstation design needs to allow maintenance to be accomplished with a minimum impact on a\nsubstation’s operation.  Allocation of adequate working space is necessary .\nIn selecting equipment , consider the service intervals recommended by the manufacturers and past\nexperience in using a particular manufacturer ’s equipment.\nSee Chapter 20, “Maintenance,” for more information.\n2.9  REFERENCES\n7 CFR 1792, subpart C, “Seismic Safety of Federally Assisted New Building Construction”\n7 CFR 1794, “Environmental Policies and Procedures.”\n40 CFR 110, “Discharge of Oil.”\n40 CFR 112, “Oil Pollution Prevention.”"

Since the electric utility industry uses English units\nfor specifying substation design construction and materials, documentation may be completed using\nEnglish units of measure.  Metric equivalent units may also be included in parentheses, e.g., 8.0 feet (2.45\nmeters).  During the formulation of design, some sketching and calculations are required to arrive at\noptimum designs.  While these are not a part of the formal plans, they are nevertheless useful in planning\nand are often valuable for future reference.\n3.2  NEED FOR DOCUMENTATION\nDocumentation forms the basis for the expression and evaluation of engineering concepts.  A document\nserves as a vehicle for the cooperative and engineer to reach agreement on a particular subject.  In its final\nform, a document fulfills its primary role of establishing design and functional requirements.  A document"

Successful designs and accurate records are convenient references\nfor designs and for standardized approaches for new substations.  Records can also be very useful in\ndiagnosing and correcting problems.  Appendix B to this chapter is a Substation Design Summary where\ndesign information can be recorded for future reference.\n3.3  PROCEDURES\nRUS has required substation design procedures and, in addition, each cooperative may have certain\nprocedures that suit its needs.\nThe chronology of a substation design is generally as shown in Table 3-1 with elapsed times varying\naccording to a particular project’s requirements.

Lead times for\nprocurement of major and/or special equipment in many cases may favor incremental purchases of\nequipment.\nSmaller projects may lend themselves more to “standard package”-type procurement while the\nprocurement for larger projects may require many vendors.\n3.5  DRAWINGS\n3.5.1  General\nFor a basic distribution substation, a “One-Line Diagram” and “Plot Plan” may be the only drawings that\nneed to be custom made by the engineer.  For example, if a substation is small, it may be possible to show\nfoundation details on the “Plot Plan.”  Similarly, the grounding layout and details might also be shown on\na “Plot Plan.”\nLarger substations will, of necessity, require more extensive documentation.  RUS Form 235,\n“Engineering Services Contract—Electric Substation Design and Construction,” details a basic list of\ndrawings often necessary.\n3.5.2  Quality\n3.5.2.1   Substation drawings of any kind should conform to industry accepted quality requirements.\n3.5.2.2   Drafting Practice:   It is recommended that drafting practices be in accordance with American\nDrafting Standards Manual , ANSI Std. Y14.  Prints of the drawings will be used in construction, not\nalways under the most convenient environmental conditions.  Experience indicates a preference for\nequipment outlines with detailed pictorial representations.  Pertinent component interfaces and\nconnections should be illustrated in adequate detail for construction and record purposes.  The dimensions\nof pertinent distances need to be shown.  Drawings, though made to scale, should not have to be scaled\nfor construction purposes.  Thought should be given to choosing scales and lettering sizes appropriate for\nthe type of drawing.  It would be desirable to use bar-type graphic scales on all drawings since many of\nthem may be reproduced in different sizes.  Plans, elevations, and sections should be organized for\nmaximum clarity.  Tolerances should be noted on drawings, such as those that specify foundation anchor\nbolt locations and equipment mounting holes on control panels.  Simplicity and clarity of drawings are\nessential."

With proper planning, CADD\nis a very productive tool.  Virtually all modern substations are now designed on CADD systems.\n3.5.2.3.2   Startup :  Parameters need to be established before the creation of any drawings with CADD.\nThese parameters are basic to CADD and permit CADD to make use of its strength and flexibility to\nproduce quality products.  These parameters will ultimately lead to the increased productivity that users\nexpect from CADD:\n1. Establish or revise key drawing criteria. The engineer needs to know what is to be shown on\neach drawing.\n2. Establish legends for the symbols that will be used.\n3. Standardize the line weights and text sizes.\n4. Establish standard layer or level schemes.\n5. Provide for the ability to isolate layers and reference other files.\n6. Provide for the ability to make changes on one file and have the changes reflected on related\ndrawings, eliminating having to change the other drawings.\n7. Establish a cell library or blocks, in a location for standard files, of items that will be\ncontinually reused in the cooperative’s drawings.\n8. Create seed files or prototype files that may be used as the base for drawing preparation.\n3.5.2.3.3   Detailing Guidelines :  The use of CADD generates new considerations and requires new\nguidelines. However, good manual detailing practices such as the following still apply to computer\ndetailing:\n1. Draw everything to scale if possible.\n2. Use good clear dimensioning.\n3. Carefully select line weights and text sizes.  Use standard sizes where applicable.\n4. Do not overdetail drawings with the use of CADD.  It makes no sense to show the threads on\nthe bolts just because you can.\n5. Use the cooperative’s standard detailing manuals and procedures, or coordinate with other key\ndesign and detailing personnel in the cooperative.\n6. If you wouldn’t show a detail with ink on mylar, it should not be drawn with CADD software.\n7. Avoid translations.  CADD software will seldom translate drawings prepared by another\nvendor’s software completely accurately.  It’s always best to use the cooperative’s standard\nCADD software.\n8. Avoid mixing drawings from different CADD packages on a project or within a cooperative.\nThe use of several different CADD packages within an organization will tend to lead to\nconfusion in detailing.\n3.5.2.4   Legends, Notes, and Symbols:   Put a definitive legend on the first sheet of each type of\ndrawing.  This legend should not only include the standard symbols, but all special symbols or\ndesignations.  A set of notes is often found to be a desirable supplement on a drawing.  Use judgment to\navoid overdoing notation.  It may be better to consider additional details on the drawings rather than a\nlong list of notes.  Electrical symbols should be in accordance with IEEE Std. 315, “Graphic Symbols for\nElectrical and Electronics Diagrams.”\n3.5.2.5   Reference Drawings:   Give proper care to the listing of reference drawings to ensure a\ncoherent, concise pattern."

On large stations, it generally is desirable to have a separate\ncable identification list.  A cable identification system should be devised to indicate the location of one\nend of each cable and the function of the cable.  An alphanumeric designation often works well.  In such a\nsystem, C4-3 could be a cable from a circuit breaker at location C4 on a grid system where C designates\nan equipment row centerline in a series A, B, C, D, etc., and 4 designates a row centerline in a series\n1,2,3,4,5,6, etc., at a right angle to centerline C.

Information concerning insulation, electrical clearances, bare conductors,\nsubstation bus design, and the application of mobile transformers and mobile substations is included.\n4.2 LAYOUT CONSIDERATIONS\n4.2.1  Initial Design Parameters\nA careful analysis of basic parameters establishing the purposes and design criteria for the substation has\nto precede the detailed design.  Much of this information can be found on the Substation Design\nSummary form of Appendix B to Chapter 3.  In addition, circuit quantities, configurations, and ratings;\nsystem and equipment protective relay schemes; the necessity for specialized equipment (such as\ncapacitor banks, current-limiting reactors, and neutral grounding devices); details of surge protection\nequipment; and requirements for direct stroke protection should be considered.\n4.2.2  Selection of Switching Scheme\nThe power system as a whole has to be considered when deciding the substation switching scheme.\nFuture system growth based on long-range forecasts may indicate the necessity for an economical, basic\narrangement initially with possible future conversion to a more sophisticated scheme as the number of\ncircuits increases.  Important circuits may require additional protection or redundant supply.  Equipment\nmaintenance requirements may necessitate bypassing facilities to enable circuit operation during\nmaintenance periods.  Since the equipment that can be out of service for maintenance or during faults\nwithout sacrificing system operation depends on alternative supplies and duplication of circuits, the\nflexibility of the switching scheme is often one of the most important selection criteria.  Large substations\nwith many circuits handling great amounts of power need to have high degrees of both flexibility and\nreliability to continue service without interruption during the most undesirable conditions.  Since\nflexibility and reliability are directly proportional to cost, the ultimate configuration has to be the result of\na compromise.\n4.2.3  Substation Expansion\nFrequently, after initial substation construction, requirements change, and plans for the ultimate\ncapabilities of the substation are altered.  As a result, expansion of the substation facilities may deviate\nfrom the anticipated initial plan.  To accommodate unforeseen future system modifications, consider the\nflexibility of the arrangement.  Since a typical substation can be expected to continue in service\nindefinitely, maintaining maximum flexibility throughout each stage of expansion will ensure the least\ncostly and most efficient use of the facilities during the service period.\nTo facilitate future expansion, arrange the initial design to accommodate all requirements of a current\nlong-range system forecast.  The site should be as large as practical to allow for future development.\nLarge areas readily allow for changes in the basic substation configuration and switching scheme should"

When a basic initial arrangement is planned, placement of equipment should take into\naccount future expansion of the substation into a more complex, reliable, and flexible configuration.\nFrequently, additional switches, switch stands, and bus supports are installed initially to facilitate future\nexpansion.\n4.2.4  Substation Profile\nThe profile of substation structures and equipment has become an increasingly important aspect to\nconsider in substation layout.  In the past, large lattice and box-type structures supporting overhead strain\nbuses were commonly used.  Most substations currently being designed and constructed use low-profile\nstructures and rigid buswork, particularly for low-voltage distribution substations or in areas with natural\nenvironmental screening.\nLow-profile construction generally uses lower structures with a minimum number of members for\nsupport.  Larger pieces of equipment, such as power transformers and power circuit breakers, have\nbecome smaller over the years.  Consequently, substations are considered less obtrusive overall.  The\nheight limitations causing the use of low-profile construction sometimes result in arrangements of\nincreased area, particularly for the lower voltage levels.  Generally, the advantages of easier equipment\noperation and maintenance as a result of reduced equipment sizes and effective locations make up for the\nexpense of purchasing somewhat larger sites.\n4.2.5  Underground Circuits\nAn effective method to improve substation appearance is to install circuits underground as they leave the\nsubstation.  Low-profile construction using lower structures with fewer support members lends itself to\nthe use of underground circuits.  Installing underground circuits  can similarly improve the appearance of\nsubstations with larger structures by reducing the size of some of the large supporting structures or\neliminating them altogether.\n4.2.6  Equipment Removal\nSubstation arrangements have to include adequate space for the installation and possible removal of large\npieces of equipment such as power transformers and power circuit breakers.  Buses, particularly in low-\nprofile arrangements, even when at acceptable operating elevations, can block the removal of equipment.\nConsequently, it is important to consider equipment removal routes during the structure layout.  Often the\nmost desirable arrangement has the main buses at higher elevations than the buses and equipment in the\nsubstation bays.  In this way, the main buses will not block the removal of equipment located in the\nsubstation interior.\nRemovable bus sections can also be provided to permit movement of large equipment.  This, however,\nrequires bus de -energization during the procedure.\nBay spacing has to be carefully evaluated during layout to allow for removal of equipment.  In multi-bay\nconfigurations, it is common to limit the number of bays to two before increasing the bay center-to-center\nspacing.  This allows equipment to be removed from a bay to the side and  provides additional space for\nmoving the equipment between a bay and an adjacent bay, as diagrammed in Figure 4-1."

It is becoming more common to\neliminate the intermediate transmission substations and directly reduce the transmission voltages to\nprimary distribution levels.  The distribution substations discussed are generally limited to the traditional\ntype characterized by simple bus arrangements and minimal equipment.  However, the arrangements can\nbe expanded for use in larger distribution substations with higher voltages.\n4.3.1  Basic Distribution Substation\nFigure 4-2 is a one-line diagram for a basic distribution substation.  Depending on the load being served,\nit is possible that initial construction may be limited to one distribution circuit.\nThe subtransmission circuit enters the substation through a primary disconnect switch used principally to\nisolate the substation from the subtransmission system for maintenance or when replacement of substation\nequipment is required.  It is usually of the three-pole, single-throw, group-operated type."

    "content": "Bulletin 1724E-300\nPage 122\nFigure 4-2:  Basic Distribution Substation\nThe power transformers commonly used in this application are two-winding type and may be single- or\nthree-phase units.  In new substations and when replacing transformers or increasing transformer\ncapacity, the trend has been toward using three-phase transformers.  In configurations using single-phase\ntransformers, a fourth transformer may be added as a spare.  Use of three-phase transformers results in a\nneater and less cluttered arrangement.  However, since failure of a three-phase transformer means loss of\nthe substation, the overall design layout should provide facilities for the rapid installation of a mobile\ntransformer or a mobile substation.\nThe two primary distribution feeders of the substation illustrated in Figure 4-2 are protected by either\npower circuit breakers or automatic circuit reclosers.  Disconnect switches on both the source and load\nsides permit isolation during maintenance or other periods when complete de-energization is required.\nThe switches can be either single-pole, single-throw, hook stick-operated or three-pole, single-throw,\ngroup-operated, depending on the arrangement.\n4.3.2  Transformer Primary Protective Devices\nTo prevent equipment damage from transformer or low-voltage bus faults, protective devices are\ngenerally provided on the primary side of the transformer.  These devices may also serve as primary\ndisconnects to enable isolation from the transmission system.\nSeveral types of devices are available, including power fuses, circuit breakers, circuit switchers, and\nvacuum interrupters.  Selection of the type of device is based on the voltage, short-circuit conditions, and\ntransformer capacity.\n4.3.3  Voltage Regulation\nTo maintain voltage at a uniform level, voltage regulation equipment is usually required in rural\ndistribution substations.  The voltage can be regulated by using either feeder or bus regulation.  Feeder\nregulation may be used in multi-circuit distribution substations, where the circuits are very diverse in load\ncharacteristics.  With feeder regulation, the voltage of each distribution circuit can be individually\nmaintained to conform to the load characteristics.  Bus regulation may be used in rural distribution\nsubstations where the distribution feeders have similar load characteristics.  Bus voltage may be\ncontrolled by using power transformers with load tap changing mechanisms, single- or three-phase\nvoltage regulators , or switched capacitor banks."

Various arrangements of power transformers and switchgear equipment are available to suit\nindividual requirements.\nUse of switchgear, unit substations, and other types of enclosed equipment eliminates  the need for\nextensive field construction since most of the equipment is preassembled by the manufacturer or supplier.\nDepending on the configuration, the equipment may be shipped completely assembled or in sections to be\nconnected together at the job site.  Feeders are normally installed underground from the switchgear\ncompartments.\nPartial enclosure of some of the low-voltage distribution equipment can be implemented to improve the\nappearance of the substation.  The equipment can be furnished in modular form to facilitate installation.\nInterconnections between modules are usually underground, although overhead bus duct is occasionally\nused.\n4.4 TRANSMISSION SUBSTATIONS\nTransmission substations are usually characterized by primary and secondary voltages of 69 kV or higher.\nSince one transmission substation may supply several distribution substations and large loads, reliability\nof service and flexibility of operation are extremely important.

Disconnect switches on both the source and\nload sides permit isolation during maintenance or other periods when complete de -energization is\nrequired.  The switches are normally of the three-pole, single-throw, group-operated type, but can be of\nthe single-pole, single-throw, and hook stick-operated type, depending on the voltage and arrangement.\nHook stick-operated switches usually are not considered above 69 kV.\n4.4.2  Circuit Breaker Bypass Facilities\nBypass facilities can be provided for the power circuit breakers to permit maintenance without circuit de-\nenergization.  Figure 4-7 illustrates a typical arrangement.\nFigure 4-7:  Typical Circuit Breaker Bypass Arrangement\nThe bypass facilities normally consist of three independent three-pole, single-throw, group-operated\nswitches.  The circuit breaker disconnect switches may be of the single-pole, single-throw, hook stick-\noperated type, depending on system voltage and bus configuration.\nIn most cases bypassing circuit breakers removes normal relay protection since the circuit breaker current\ntransformers are also removed from service.  The overall protection scheme, have to be designed to\nprovide for this situation.  Fused bypass switches may be used for temporary feeder protection.\n4.4.3  Surge Arresters\nBecause of the desire for high reliability and the high cost of equipment replacement, surge arresters are\ninstalled in various positions in transmission substations.  Since power transformers are particularly\nsensitive to overvoltages, they normally have arresters on each phase of both the primary and secondary.\nAlso install arresters on each ungrounded phase of the tertiary winding when it is brought out to provide\nservice.\nThe highest degree of equipment protection occurs with the surge arresters located as close as possible to\nthe equipment to be protected.  Power transformers can usually be furnished with arrester mounting\nbrackets adjacent to the transformer bushings.\nOccasionally, surge arresters or other surge protective equipment are located at the line entrances and\nexits.  In these instances, it is best to locate the arresters or other protective equipment on the line side of\nthe substation equipment to be protected to limit the lightning and switching surges to acceptable levels as\nthey enter the substation.  Locating the arresters on the line side of the circuit breakers will also protect\nthe gap in the breakers when in the open position."

In some instances, the two pieces of\nequipment may be mounted on a common structure or stand, depending on the arrangement.  The\nparticular relaying and communications schemes being used on the circuit will dictate the number of\nphases containing line traps and coupling capacitor voltage transformers.\n4.4.5  Voltage Transformers\nVoltage transformers are used in conjunction with the circuit and equipment protection, synchronization,\nand metering schemes.  They are normally mounted on individual or three-position stands.  Depending on\nthe bus configuration and the relaying schemes, the voltage transformers may be positioned near the\ncircuit entrance positions or adjacent to the buses.\nIt is usually desirable to provide a method for disconnecting the voltage transformers.  One possible\nmethod is to install the primary connections to the appropriate buses by using disconnectable clamps.  In\narrangements using voltage transformers at the circuit positions, they can be positioned to allow de-\nenergization by opening the power circuit breaker and the line disconnect switches.\n4.4.6  Current Transformers\nCurrent transformers used in both relaying and metering schemes can usually be located inside major\nequipment such as power circuit breakers and power transformers.  These current transformers are\nnormally multi-ratio bushing type and therefore do not require special mounting provisions.  In some\ncases, separately mounted current transformers may be required, such as for revenue metering purposes.\nThey are usually installed on individual stands and located as required.\n4.4.7  Grounding Switches\nManually operated grounding switches are frequently used to ground incoming circuits during\nmaintenance or other out-of-service periods.  These switches can be separately mounted or, as is usually\nthe case, can be furnished as part of the circuit disconnect switches.  The switches can then be interlocked\nin such a way as to prevent both from being closed simultaneously.\nHigh-speed grounding switches are sometimes used in power transformer protection schemes to initiate\ntripping of remote circuit breakers during transformer faults.  As with manually operated grounding\nswitches, high-speed grounding switches can be separately mounted or can be furnished as part of group-\noperated disconnect switches.  High-speed grounding switches are normally installed on one phase only.\nThe use of high-speed grounding switches, while still in practice, is generally not preferred since its use\nsubjects the system to more of a shock and potentially affects more customers on the system.\n4.5 SWITCHING STATIONS\nSwitching stations do not change system voltage from one level to another and therefore do not contain\npower transformers.  Switching stations usually operate at subtransmission or transmission voltage levels."

Possible\ncircuit or substation outages and equipment damage as a result of the unprotected surges should be\nconsidered.  In general, if there is any question, surge arresters should be installed for equipment and\ncircuit protection.\n4.6 TYPICAL BUS CONFIGURATIONS\nThe typical bus configurations may be used for distribution, transmission, or switching substations at\nvoltages up to 345 kV.  Details will vary depending on the type and voltage(s) of the substations.

Portions of\ndifferent layouts may be combined, as required, to achieve desired configurations.\nIt is important that the engineer’s plans remain as flexible as possible during substation layout to allow for\nunforeseen difficulties as designs progress.  Coordinate activities with the equipment manufacturers to\nensure that each design detail reflects the actual equipment to be used."

This arrangement is the simplest, but provides the least amount of system reliability.  Bus\nfaults or failure of circuit breakers to operate under fault conditions results in complete loss of the\nsubstation.  The single bus configuration can be constructed by using either low- or high-profile\nstructures.  Figure 4-9 illustrates the single bus arrangement with low-profile structures and presents a\nneat, orderly plan.  The high-profile design, shown in Figure 4-10, accomplishes the same purpose and\nmay not require as large a site for a given system voltage.\nThe single bus arrangement is not recommended without circuit breaker bypass facilities that permit\ncircuit breaker maintenance while maintaining circuit operation.  The high-profile configuration can\neasily be modified to provide this feature by installing group-operated switches and the associated\nbuswork and connections in the positions shown in Figure 4-10.  This arrangement, however, results in\nloss of overcurrent protection for the circuit except by remote circuit breakers during the bypassing\noperations.  A fault occurring on the line with the breaker bypassed would result in complete substation\nshutdown.  The low-profile arrangement does not allow for future addition of this type of bypassing\nequipment.  Consequently, in both low-profile and some high-profile substations, the bypass facilities can\nbe installed outside the substation.  Switches can be provided that, when closed, parallel two lines to\nenable one circuit breaker to be removed from service.  The other breaker then protects both circuits.  If\nthis bypassing method is used, the equipment associated with both circuits, have to be capable of carrying\nthe total load of both circuits.  If the load is greater than the equipment capability, the load should be\nreduced.  This method of circuit breaker bypassing may be more desirable in high-profile arrangements\nthan that shown in Figure 4-10 for lines where frequent or lengthy equipment maintenance is expected.\nThe high-profile configuration shown in Figure 4-10 is generally limited to distribution and\nsubtransmission voltage levels.  At transmission voltage levels, independent structures and strain bus\ninterconnections are usually used.\n4.6.1.1  Advantages:\n1. Lowest cost\n2. Small land area required\n3. Easily expandable\n4. Simple in concept and operation\n5. Relatively simple for the application of protective relaying\n4.6.1.2  Disadvantages:\n1. High-profile arrangement equipped with circuit breaker bypass facilities does not provide for\ncircuit protection when bypass facilities are being used inside the substation.\n2. A single bus arrangement has the lowest reliability.\n3. Failure of a circuit breaker or a bus fault causes loss of the entire substation.\n4. Maintenance switching can complicate and disable some of the protective relay scheme and\noverall relay coordination.\n5.

The sectionalizing breakers may be operated normally open or closed, depending on system\nrequirements.  In this arrangement, a bus fault or breaker failure causes only the affected bus section to be\nremoved from service and thus eliminates total substation shutdown.  Usually, the fault can be isolated\nand nonfaulted portions of the system restored to service easier and faster because of the increased\nflexibility of this arrangement.\nFigure 4-11:  Sectionalized Bus\nPhysically, the equipment can be organized similar to that shown in Figures 4-9 and 4-10 for the single\nbus arrangement.  The sectionalizing breakers and their associated isolation switches are located in line\nwith the main bus.  In the high-profile configuration, it is usually desirable to provide a separate bay for\nthe sectionalizing breakers and switches to facilitate maintenance and removal.\nThe arrangement of lines and transformers in a sectionalized bus arrangement depends on system\noperating criteria.  They should be arranged so as to prevent outage of lines or other circuits dependent on\neach other.  This can be accomplished by positioning the interrelated circuits on different bus sections to\neliminate concurrent shutdown.

Additional circuit breakers are required for sectionalizing.\n3. Sectionalizing may cause interruption of nonfaulted circuits.\n4.6.3  Main and Transfer Bus\nA main and transfer bus configuration consists of two independent buses, one of which, the main bus, is\nnormally energized.  Under normal operating conditions, all incoming and outgoing circuits are fed from\nthe main bus through their associated circuit breakers and switches.  If it becomes necessary to remove a\ncircuit breaker from service for maintenance or repairs, the integrity of circuit operation can be\nmaintained through use of the bypass and bus tie equipment.  The bypass switch for the circuit breaker to\nbe isolated is closed, the bus tie breaker and its isolation switches are closed, and the bypassed breaker\nand its isolation switches are opened to remove the breaker from service.  The circuit is then protected by\nthe bus tie breaker.\nFigure 4-12 illustrates a main and transfer bus configuration in a low-profile arrangement.  For\ncomparison, Figure 4-13 shows the same switching scheme with high-profile box-type structures.  With\nthe box-type structure arrangement, two circuit positions can be accommodated per equipment bay.\nHowever, with the low-profile arrangement, each circuit requires its own bay and, as a result, somewhat\nmore land area may be required.  When the low-profile configuration is used, equipment bays should be\nlimited in width to a maximum of two bays before the bay-to-bay centerline spacing is increased to\naccommodate circuit breaker maintenance and removal.  Without the additional space, these tasks can\nbecome very difficult.\nThe high-profile, box-type structure arrangement shown in Figure 4-13 can accommodate multiple\ncircuits in a relatively small area.  The configuration is particularly suitable in environmentally shielded\nor otherwise isolated locations, where only a limited substation site is available.  This arrangement is\ngenerally limited to distribution and subtransmission voltage levels.  At transmission voltage levels,\nindependent structures and strain bus interconnections can be used.\n4.6.3.1  Advantages:\n1. Accommodation of circuit breaker maintenance while maintaining service and line protection\n2. Reasonable in cost\n3. Fairly small land area\n4. Easily expandable\n4.6.3.2  Disadvantages:\n1. An additional circuit breaker is required for bus tie.\n2. Since the bus tie breaker, have to be able to be substituted for any line breaker, its associated\nrelaying may be somewhat complicated.\n3. Failure of a circuit breaker or a bus fault causes loss of the entire substation.\n4. Somewhat complicated switching is required to remove a circuit breaker from service for\nmaintenance."

This results in a\nclosed loop or ring with each bus section separated by a circuit breaker.  For maximum reliability and\noperational flexibility, each section should supply only one circuit.\nIn this arrangement, as with the sectionalized bus configuration, only limited bus sections and circuits are\nremoved from service because of line or bus faults or circuit breaker failure.  For a line or bus fault, the\ntwo circuit breakers on the sides of the affected bus section open to isolate the fault.  The remaining\ncircuits operate without interruption.  For a breaker failure, the two breakers on the sides of the affected\nbreaker open, along with a transfer trip to a remote breaker, to isolate the failed breaker and remove two\nbus sections from service.\nThe ring bus arrangement provides for circuit breaker maintenance since any breaker can normally be\nremoved from service without interruption of service to any circuits.  As a result, separate circuit breaker\nbypass facilities are not required.\nA number of equipment arrangements may be used to provide a ring bus configuration, depending on\nanticipated substation expansion and possible system modifications.  Figure 4-14 illustrates a typical ring\nbus configuration.  The arrangement shows four circuit positions, which is a practical maximum for a ring\nbus configuration.  Rather than expanding the ring bus to accommodate additional circuits, other more\nflexible and reliable configurations, such as the breaker-and-a-half scheme, can be adopted.  The ring bus\narrangement shown in Figure 4-14 is readily adaptable in the future to a breaker-and-a-half configuration\nas shown in Figure 4-15.

Electrically\nconnected between the buses are three circuit breakers and, between each two breakers, a circuit as\ndiagrammed in Figure 4-15.  In this arrangement, three circuit breakers are used for two independent\ncircuits; hence, each circuit shares the common center circuit breaker, so there are one-and-a-half circuit\nbreakers per circuit.\nThe breaker-and-a-half configuration provides for circuit breaker maintenance, since any breaker can be\nremoved from service without interrupting any circuits.  Additionally, faults on either of the main buses\ncause no circuit interruptions.

Prepare detailed construction\nestimates for all schemes under consideration.\n4.7 PROTECTION OF SUBSTATION INSULATION\n4.7.1  General\nSubstation electrical equipment is subject to abnormal conditions as a result of direct lightning strokes,\nlightning surges, switching surges, and faults on the system.  These abnormal conditions can cause\novervoltages that may result in equipment flashover or insulation failure.  To prevent equipment damage\nand/or system shutdown from overvoltages, protective devices are used to limit the overvoltages to\nreasonable levels.  Application of these devices is usually a compromise between the costs of the devices\nand the degree of protection desired.\nThe protection provided for substations and substation equipment can be broken into two main parts:\n1. Surge protection, employed to protect the equipment from damaging overvoltages caused by\nlightning surges, switching surges, and system faults\n2. Direct stroke protection, employed to protect the equipment from direct lightning strokes\n4.7.2  Surge Protection\nSurge arresters are used to protect equipment against overvoltages caused by incoming surges.  The\narresters function by discharging surge current to the ground system and then interrupt the current to\nprevent flow of normal power frequency follow current to ground.  A detailed discussion concerning the\napplication and selection of surge arresters can be found in Section 5.8.\n4.7.3  Direct Stroke Protection\n4.7.3.1  Shielding:  Since the effects of a direct lightning stroke to an unshielded substation can be\ndevastating, it is recommended that some form of direct stroke protection be provided.  Direct stroke\nprotection normally consists of shielding the substation equipment by using lightning masts, overhead\nshield wires, or a combination of these devices.  The types and arrangements of protective schemes used\nare based on the size and configuration of the substation equipment.\n4.7.3.2  Overhead Shield Wires:  Overhead shield wires are often used to provide direct stroke\nprotection.  The shield wires can be supported by the circuit pull-off structures, if conveniently located, to\nextend over the substation.  Since these shield wires are located above substation buses and equipment,\nbreakage could result in outage of and/or damage to equipment.  To minimize possible breakage, the\noverhead shield wire systems are constructed from high-quality, high-strength materials such as have\nbeen accepted by RUS (see RUS IP 202-1, “List of Materials Acceptable for Use on Systems of RUS\nElectrification Borrowers”).  Shield wires should be limited to a maximum design tension of 8900\nnewtons (2000 pounds) per conductor under the appropriate loading conditions as defined in the National\nElectrical Safety Code .  This tension is based only on wire strength and has to be coordinated with\nsupport structure design.  Lower tensions may be required for certain applications, depending on the\ncapabilities of the support structures.  Sag has to be considered to ensure adequate clearance from\nenergized equipment."

In areas not employing transmission line shielding, substation shield wire systems\nshould be extended at least 805 meters (one-half mile) away from the substation to limit the exposure of\nthe phase conductors to direct strokes near the substation.  Strokes occurring on the circuits beyond the\nshielding will usually be attenuated enough by the time they reach the substation to be discharged\nsuccessfully by the surge arresters without causing equipment damage.  For adequate protection, the\ncircuit wire systems should be directly connected to the substation shield wire system.\n4.7.3.3  Shielding Masts:  Shielding masts can be used for nearly all types of substations to provide\nprotection against direct lightning strokes.  They are particularly useful in large substations and those of\nlow-profile design.  Shielding masts can be guyed or self-supporting steel poles or lattice-type towers and\nare usually made of steel.  Other materials, such as precast concrete or aluminum, can also be used.\nIn some instances, shielding masts can also be used to provide support for substation lighting equipment.\n4.7.3.4  Protection Calculation Methods:  There are two widely used methods for designing\nsubstation lightning protection:\n1. Fixed angle\n2. Rolling sphere\nThe zone of protection of a shielding system is the volume of space inside which equipment is considered\nadequately protected by the system.  A shielding system allowing no more that 0.1 percent of the total\npredicted number of lightning strokes to terminate on the protected equipment is considered adequate for\nmost situations.\n4.7.3.4.1  Fixed Angle Method :  The fixed angle design method uses vertical angles to determine the\nnumber, position, and height of shielding masts and wires.  The shaded areas in Figure 4-17 illustrate the\nzones of protection afforded by single- and double-mast or shield wire systems.  For a single mast, the\nzone of protection consists of a cone.  For a single shield wire, the zone of protection is a wedge.  When\ntwo or more masts or shield wires are used, the zones of protection of each overlap to provide complete\ncoverage.  Figure 4-17 also lists the ranges of angles that have been used for various shielding systems.\nFigure 4-17:  Zones of Protection for Masts and Shield Wires Using Fixed Angle Method"

The sphere rolls up and over (and is supported by) lightning\nmasts, shield wires, and other grounded metal objects intended for lightning shielding.  A piece of\nequipment is protected from a direct stroke if it remains below the curved surface of the sphere by virtue\nof the sphere’s being elevated by shield wires or other devices.  Equipment that touches the sphere or\npenetrates its surface is not protected.  The basic concept is shown in Figure 4-18.\nFigure 4-18 :  Principle of Rolling Sphere.  Ref. IEEE Std. 998-1996, Fig. 7-3.\nCopyright © 1996.  IEEE.  All rights reserved.\nThe radius of the sphere is determined by calculating the strike distance.  The strike distance is the length\nof the final jump of the stepped leader as its potential exceeds the breakdown resistance of the last gap of\nair to ground.  A stepped leader is the static discharge that propagates from a cloud into the air.\nThe allowable stroke current that may be received by a substation bus without exceeding the withstand\nvalue, or BIL, of the substation is defined by Equation 4-1:"

The many nuances and criteria on which the procedure is based are found in IEEE Std. 998,\n“Guide for Direct Lightning Stroke Shielding of Substations.”\nThe engineer designing the shielding system needs to also take into account the isokeraunic level of the\narea where the substation will be built.  The isokeraunic level is the average annual number of\nthunderstorm days for a given locality.  The U.S. Weather Bureau publishes a chart that shows the\nisokeraunic levels across the United States.\nFor a complete description of both the fixed angle and the rolling sphere methods, refer to IEEE Std. 998,\n“Guide for Direct Lightning Stroke Shielding of Substations.”\n4.7.3.5  Shielding System Grounding:  A shielding system cannot effectively protect substation\nequipment unless adequately grounded.  Multiple low impedance connections from the shielding system\nto the substation ground grid are essential.  It is beneficial to use at least two separate connections to\nensure continuity and reliability.  Whenever nonconducting masts or supports are used, install separate\nground cables to establish a direct connection from the shield system to the substation ground system."

Apparatus insulators are normally manufactured\nfrom electrical-grade wet-process porcelain and are available in two major types: cap and pin-type and\npost-type.  Other types are also available from some insulator manufacturers.\n4.8.1.2  BIL (Impulse Withstand) Ratings of Outdoor Apparatus Insulators :  For apparatus\ninsulators, impulse withstand voltages are commonly referred to as BILs.   Apparatus insulators are\navailable with BIL ratings as shown in Table 4- 2.  Use of the  BILs for the  nominal system voltages listed\nwill normally ensure adequate coordination with protective devices and insulation systems of other\nequipment for most operating conditions.  In areas of extremely high contamination, it may be desirable\nto increase the insulator BIL to levels higher than listed.\nTable 4-2:  Apparatus Insulator BIL Ratings for Nominal System Voltages.\nRef. NEMA SG-6-1995, Table 32-1.

C37.30, “Definitions and Requirements for High-Voltage Air Switches,\nInsulators, and Bus Supports, ” equipment that depends on air for its insulating medium will have a lower\ndielectric strength when operated at higher altitudes than when operating at lower altitudes.  For altitudes\nabove 1000 meters (3300 feet), the correction factors shown in Table 4- 3 should be applied to reduce the\ninsulator BILs.\n4.8.1.3  Cap and Pin-Type Outdoor Apparatus Insulators:  Cap and pin-type ( Cpt) apparatus\ninsulators are the original insulator type used in substation construction.  While Cpt is still in use, post-\ntype insulators are more commonly used today in substation design and are recommended for any new\nconstruction or rebuilding of existing facilities.\n4.8.1.4  Post-Type Outdoor Apparatus Insulators :  Post-type apparatus insulators are the type most\noften used today for new substation construction.  The uniform profile and smaller diameter enhance\ninsulator appearance.  Post insulator types in general use are made of porcelain and polymer.  The\npolymer type is less rigid than porcelain or composite and is not recommended for switch supports."

End caps for\nmounting the insulators are cemented to the porcelain.  The insulators are manufactured with a minimum\nnumber of joints, which inherently reduces deflections.\nThe short skirts of post insulators make them less susceptible to damage from flashovers.  Even if some of\nthe skirts are damaged, insulation integrity is usually maintained since the dry arcing distances are not\ngreatly affected.\nPost-type insulators are available in two types: stacking and nonstacking.  Single nonstacking insulators\nare normally used through nominal voltages of 69 kV (350 kV BIL).  At nominal voltages of 115 kV (550\nkV BIL) and above, stacking insulators are used.  See Figure 4-19.\nSince post-type insulators are available in different colors, preferences should be made known in advance\nof purchasing.\nPost-type apparatus insulators are manufactured and tested in accordance with the following standards:\n• ANSI C29.1 “Test Methods for Electrical Power Insulators”\n• ANSI C29.9 “American National Standard for Wet-Process Porcelain Insulators (Apparatus,\nPost Type)”\n4.8.1.5  Leakage Distance of Outdoor Apparatus Insulators:  Post-type apparatus insulators depend\non the insulating material contours to achieve the required leakage distances.  Skirt breakage on a post\ntype usually will not cause insulator flashover since a much smaller percentage of the total leakage\ndistance is destroyed compared to the cap and pin type.  Post-type apparatus insulators generally have\nlonger leakage distances than their counterparts, particularly at the lower BILs.\nIn areas of high contamination it is usually desirable to utilize insulators with either longer than standard"

The various ratings available can be found in ANSI and NEMA standards and in\nmanufacturers’ literature.\nFor most applications, cantilever strength is the most important mechanical characteristic.  However,\ndepending on the actual insulator application, some of the other characteristics can become important and\nshould be considered.  These insulator characteristics include tensile strength, compressive strength, and\ntorsional strength.  The design and manufacture of post-type apparatus insulators allow equal cantilever\nstrength ratings in both upright and underhung mounting positions.\nTypical characteristics of cap and pin-type and post-type apparatus insulators can be found in Tables 4-4\nand 4-5, respectively.  Post insulators are recommended."

The mounting holes are usually tapped for\nbolts of 1/2\" with 13 threads per inch, 5/8\" with 11 threads per inch, or 3/4\" with 10 threads per inch,\nrespectively.  Adapters are available to go from one bolt circle size to another.\nUpright or underhung mounting usually does not present major problems, provided the insulators are\nutilized within their mechanical and electrical capabilities.  When the insulators are installed horizontally,\nthe weight of the insulators, fittings, buses, and any other supported equipment have to be considered to\ndetermine the permissible loads.  Some manufacturers recommend reducing the allowable loads from the\ntabulated values for horizontally mounted insulators.  Unusual applications can be referred to the\nmanufacturers for recommendations.\n4.8.2  Suspension Insulators\n4.8.2.1  Types:  Suspension insulators are used as insulation and support for strain buses in\nsubstations.  Suspension insulators are available in several forms to suit individual requirements.\nDistribution deadend-type suspension insulators can be used at distribution voltages for substation strain\nbuses.  Distribution deadend suspension insulators normally have clevis-type connections.  Conventional\nsuspension insulators are normally used for strain bus insulation at higher voltages and can be furnished\nwith either clevis or ball and socket connections.  The conventional suspension insulators most commonly\nused are 25.4 centimeters (10 inches) in diameter and 14.6 centimeters (5 ¾ inches) in length.  Suspension\ninsulators are manufactured out of porcelain, polymer, and glass.  See Figure 4-20.\nSuspension insulators acceptable for use on RUS-financed systems are listed in RUS IP 202-1.\n4.8.2.2  Electrical Characteristics of Suspension Insulators.  To achieve the necessary electrical\ncharacteristics, a number of suspension insulators are strung together in series.  It is important to\ncoordinate the insulation characteristics of suspension insulator strings with the insulation systems of\nother substation equipment and the characteristics of various insulation protective devices.\nThe quantity of suspension insulators chosen for a particular application should be large enough to\nprevent unnecessary flashovers.  Overinsulation, however, can result in flashovers occurring from phase\nto phase rather than from phase to ground.  Consequently, the quantity of insulators should be small\nenough that all flashovers occur to ground.\nTable 4-6 lists the recommended minimum quantities of standard 14.6 x 25.4 cm (5 ¾ x 10 in.)\nsuspension insulators for particular nominal system voltages and BILs.  Additional insulators should be\nconsidered under the following conditions:\n1. Above 1000 meters (3300 feet), the correction factors listed in Table 4-3 should be applied to\nthe BILs and the insulator quantities correspondingly increased.\n2. In areas of high contamination, it may be necessary to increase the insulator quantities or\nconsider the use of specially designed equipment.\n3. When deadending on steel structures, an additional insulator is typically added.\n4. When installed at an angle other than vertical, one or two insulators should be added when the\nangle from vertical approaches 45 degrees and 90 degrees, respectively."

These\nstrength ratings are not the actual loads the insulators are designed to operate under, but represent ultimate\nstrengths.  The insulators also have proof test ratings specified in ANSI Std. C29.2 as one half the\nmechanical–electrical ratings.  These ratings are the actual loads that the insulators have withstood during\ntesting.  The maximum suspension insulator loading should not exceed 40 percent of the mechanical–\nelectrical strength ratings listed in RUS IP 202-1.\n4.9 ELECTRICAL CLEARANCES\nTable 4-7 lists the electrical clearances for outdoor substation construction.  The values identified as\nminimums should be maintained or exceeded at all times.  Phase-to-ground and phase-to-phase clearances\nshould be coordinated to ensure that possible flashovers occur from phase to ground rather than from\nphase to phase.\nTable 4-8 lists the phase spacing of various types of outdoor air switches.  The minimum metal-to-metal\nclearances should be maintained at all times with the switches in the open position, closed position, or\nanywhere between the open and closed positions."

    "content": "Bulletin 1724E-300\nPage 156\nWhen nonrigid conductors are used for outdoor overhead substation buses, the movement of the\nconductors caused by temperature changes and wind and ice loads has to be considered.  The usual\npractice is to increase the centerline-to-centerline bus spacing and the phase-to-ground clearances to\ncompensate for these conditions.  Increase the minimum metal-to-metal, bus centerline-to-centerline, and\nminimum ground clearances listed in Table 4-7 by at least 50 percent for nonrigid conductors.  Check to\nensure that the minimum metal-to-metal clearances listed in Tables 4-7 and 4-8 are maintained or\nexceeded at all times for all expected temperature and loading conditions.  The movement of nonrigid\nconductors can also be calculated using the NESC  conductor movement envelopes for line conductors.\nIn some locations, contamination from airborne particles necessitates increasing the minimum electrical\nclearances.  Satisfactory operation can usually be obtained by using clearances one step above those\nnormally used.  In extremely contaminated locations, additional clearance may be required.\nSince the dielectric strength of air-insulated equipment decreases with increasing altitude, the clearances\nlisted in Table 4-7 have to be modified for use at altitudes above 1000 meters (3300 feet).  To determine\nappropriate clearances for use above 1000 meters (3300 feet), first derate the standard BILs by applying\nthe factors listed in Table 4-3.  Then choose the clearances from Table 4-7 corresponding to the derated\nBILs selected.  For example, at an altitude of 2400 meters (8000 feet), a maximum voltage of 121 kV is to\nbe used.  From Table 4-3, the standard BIL of 550 kV has to be derated by applying a multiplying factor\nof 0.86.  Table 4-9 shows the effects of derating for 2400 meters (8000 feet):\nTable 4-9:  Effects of Derating\nfor 2400 Meters\nStandard BILs\nkVDerated BILs\nkV\n550 473\n650 559\n750 645\nA 650 kV BIL should be selected for use at 2400 meters (8000 feet) to provide a BIL equivalent to 550\nkV at altitudes of 1000 meters (3300 feet) and below.  The clearances to be used are those associated with\nthe 650 kV standard BIL, as listed in Tables 4-7 and 4-8.\nAs an option to the above equipment selection, the engineer may evaluate the derated BIL in terms of the\ncapability of surge arresters applied to the equipment to provide protection to the equipment.  With\napplicable protective margins, surge arresters available today may be able to protect voltage-derated\nequipment without increasing the equipment BIL for compensation.\nIn addition to the electrical clearances previously described, it is necessary to provide adequate space for\nequipment maintenance.  In arrangements where equipment such as power circuit breakers, reclosers,\ndisconnect switches, power transformers, or other equipment has to be maintained while portions of\nadjacent equipment remain energized, provide sufficient space around the equipment to prevent\naccidental contact by maintenance personnel.\nIn arrangements with buses or equipment crossing over other buses and equipment, maintain adequate\nclearance between the adjacent buses and equipment for all operational conditions.  Position power\ntransformers and power circuit breakers to permit removal of any bushing.  Locate switches and other\nequipment with externally moving parts to prevent infringement on the minimum clearances listed in\nTables 4-7 and 4-8 during operation or when in any position.  Also consider conductor, equipment, or\nsupport structure movement during heavily loaded or deformed conditions."

The clearances listed in the NESC  have to be maintained or\nexceeded at all times.\nAnother clearance requirement is the location of the substation perimeter fence with respect to live parts\nwithin the substation.  A safety clearance zone is required to keep someone outside the substation from\nsticking an object through the fence and coming in contact with live parts or get ting close enough  to cause\na flashover to occur.  Use Figure 4-21 to locate exposed live parts outside the safety  clearance zone.\n4.10 BARE CONDUCTORS\n4.10.1  Conductor Materials\nCopper and aluminum are the two major conductor materials used for substation buses and equipment\nconnections.  Both materials can be fabricated into various types of flexible or rigid conductors.  The\ntrend in substation construction is toward use of mostly aluminum conductors.  Copper conductors are\nused principally for expansion of similar systems in existing substations.\nThe conductivity of aluminum is from 50 to 60 percent that of copper, depending on the aluminum alloy.\nConsequently, larger aluminum conductors are required to carry the same currents as copper conductors.\nThe larger aluminum conductor diameters result in greater wind and ice loads but tend to minimize\ncorona, which is more of a problem at higher voltages.\nFor the same ampacity, copper conductors weigh approximately twice as much as aluminum conductors.\nThe higher copper conductor weights can result in more sag as compared with aluminum conductors for\nequal spans.  To reduce the sag, it is usually necessary to increase the number of supports for rigid\nconductors or, in the case of flexible conductors, increase the tensions.\n4.10.2  Rigid Conductors\nRigid electrical conductors are available in a variety of shapes and sizes to suit individual requirements.\nSome of the more commonly used shapes include flat bars, structural shapes, and tubes.  Specific physical\nand electrical properties and application data can be obtained from the conductor manufacturers.\n4.10.2.1  Flat Bars:   Flat bars can be utilized for outdoor substation buses and are particularly suitable\nsince they can be easily bent and joined.  For high-current applications, a number of flat bars can be\ngrouped together, leaving a small space between the bars to facilitate heat dissipation.  The ampacity of a\ngroup of flat bars depends on whether the bars are arranged vertically or horizontally.  The number of\nbars that can be grouped together is limited because of skin and proximity effects. Flat bars are usually\nlimited to use at lower voltages because of corona.\nBecause of their inherent lack of rigidity, supports for flat bar buses are usually closely spaced to\nminimize the effects of meteorological loads and short-circuit forces.\n4.10.2.2  Structural Shapes:  The structural shape conductors that have been used in outdoor\nsubstation construction consist primarily of angle and channel types.  The flat surfaces permit bolting\ndirectly to support insulators and provide convenient connection points.  To increase ampacity, two angles\nor channels can be used.  Special fittings are usually required for these configurations.  The positioning\nand grouping of structural shapes have limitations similar to those of flat bars."

The flat surfaces of square\ntubes provide convenient connection and support points.  To facilitate heat dissipation, ventilation holes\nare sometimes provided in the square tubes.  Round tubular conductors are the most popular shape used in\noutdoor substation construction.  The round shape is very efficient structurally and electrically and\nminimizes corona at higher voltages.  The special fittings required for connecting, terminating, and\nsupporting round tubular conductors are widely available.\n4.10.2.4  Special Shapes:  Special shapes combining the advantages of several of the standard shapes\nare also available.  Integral web channel buses, uniform thickness angles, and other special configurations\ncan be furnished.\n4.10.2.5  Aluminum Alloys and Tempers:  Aluminum conductors are available in a variety of alloys\nand tempers with different conductor conductivities and strengths.  Round tubular conductors are usually\nspecified as either 6061-T6 or 6063-T6 alloy.  The 6063-T6 alloy has a conductivity approximately 23\npercent higher and a minimum yield strength approximately 29 percent lower than the 6061-T6 alloy.\nConsequently, the 6063-T6 alloy can carry higher currents but may require shorter support intervals.\nBoth Schedule 40 and 80 pipe are available in either alloy.  The Schedule 80 sizes have wall thicknesses\napproximately 40 percent thicker than the Schedule 40 sizes, resulting in lower deflections for equal span\nlengths.\nAlloy 6106-T61 is frequently utilized for flat bars, structural shapes, and square tubes.  Other alloys and\ntempers are available for special applications.\n4.10.3  Flexible Conductors\nFlexible electrical conductors can be used as substation buses and equipment taps.  The conductors are\nnormally cables fabricated by stranding a number of small conductors into one larger conductor.\nStranding provides the required conductor flexibility while maintaining strength.  The flexibility can be\nincreased by reducing the diameter and increasing the quantity of individual conductors.  Bare electrical\ncables for substation construction are usually concentric lay stranded with Class A or AA stranding in\naccordance with ASTM Std. B231.\nMost flexible conductors used in substation construction consist of all copper, all aluminum, or aluminum\nwith steel reinforcing (ACSR).  The conductor type selected for a particular application is usually based\non the span length, tension and tolerable sag, and cost.  For long spans, large supporting structures will be\nrequired.  The size and cost of these structures may depend on the conductor type and should be\nconsidered during the selection process.\nFlexible conductors are available in many sizes.  Size selection is based on ampacity, strength, weight,\nand diameter.  Conductor diameter becomes increasingly important at higher voltages where corona can\nbe a problem.\nData concerning the physical and electrical properties of the various wire types can be found in\nmanufacturers’ literature."

    "content": "Bulletin 1724E-300\nPage 160\n4.10.4  Conductor Ampacity\nThe ampacity of bare conductors is based on a number of factors, including the conductor material,\nproximity of the conductors, climatic conditions, conductor temperature rise, emissivity, and altitude.\nCopper conductors can carry about 1.3 or more times as much current as aluminum conductors of the\nsame size.  However, based on weight, more than twice as much copper is required for the same\nampacity.\nThe current distribution of closely spaced conductors is affected by their mutual inductance in accordance\nwith the proximity effect.  The additional losses attributed to this effect can usually be neglected if\nconductor spacing is 45.7 centimeters (18 inches) or greater.\nClimatic conditions have a great effect on conductor ampacity.  Ampacities are usually determined based\non ambient temperatures of 40oC (104oF).  For prolonged ambient temperatures above this value,\nampacities are usually reduced.  Wind tends to reduce the temperature of outdoor bare conductors.  An\nassumed steady wind may be reasonable in many areas.  The sun’s radiation can cause the temperature of\nbare conductors to increase, which results in lower ampacities and should be considered in predominately\nsunny locations.\nConductor temperature rise is the temperature increase above ambient at which the conductor is\noperating.  To prevent excessive surface oxidation and possible damage from annealing, the temperature\nrise is usually limited to 30oC (54oF) for a total maximum conductor temperature of 70oC (158oF) under\nnormal operating conditions.  The trend is toward higher operating temperatures.  Temperature rises of\n50oC (90oF) and higher have been used successfully.  However, temperatures that could damage the\nconductors or connected equipment should be avoided.\nThe conductor surface emissivity has an effect on conductor ampacity.  For aluminum conductors,\nemissivity is usually taken as 0.5 and for copper conductors 0.8.  Both of these values are for heavily\nweathered conductor surfaces.  The ampacity is usually higher for greater emissivity.\nAccording to ANSI Std. C37.30, “Definitions and Requirements for High-Voltage Air Switches,\nInsulators, and Bus Supports,” equipment that depends on air for its cooling medium will have a higher\ntemperature rise when operated at higher altitudes than when operating at lower altitudes.  For altitudes in\nexcess of 1000 meters (3300 feet), the correction factors listed in Table 4-10 should be applied.  Consider\na conductor with an ampacity of 1000 amperes in a 40oC (104oF) ambient temperature with a 30oC (54oF)\ntemperature rise at an altitude of 1000 meters (3300 feet).  If this conductor is to be used at a higher\naltitude, the ampacity has to be corrected.  At 5400 meters (18,000 feet), this conductor will have an\nampacity of 1000 x 0.910 = 910 amperes in an ambient temperature of 40oC (104oF) with a 30oF (54oF)\ntemperature rise.  The conductor may be operated at 1000 amperes at 5400 meters (18,000 feet), provided\nthe ambient temperature does not exceed 40oC x 0.824 = 33oC (104oF x 0.824 = 85.7oF) and the\ntemperature rise does not exceed 30oC (54oF).\n4.10.5  Bus Connections\n4.10.5.1  General:  It is customary to purchase rigid bus conductors in lengths ranging from 3.05\nmeters (10 feet) to 12.2 meters (40 feet).  Sections need to be joined together for longer lengths.  Taps are\nrequired from buses to electrical equipment.  Bus conductors need to be attached to support insulators.\nFor greatest reliability and lowest cost, the fewer the connections the better ."

Bolted connections\nare utilized in connecting two or more flat surfaces together.  Clamp-type connections generally involve\nthe use of special fittings fabricated to permit conductors to be joined together or connected to other\nequipment.  Compression connections are principally used for splicing or terminating flexible conductors.\nWelded connections are used primarily with rigid aluminum conductors.  Weldment fittings are available\nthat eliminate extensive conductor cutting and shaping prior to welding.  Compression fittings are now\navailable for rigid tubular bus.\nWhenever connectors are utilized for making electrical connections, they should be equivalent electrically\nand mechanically to the conductors themselves.  Substation connectors are designed, manufactured, and\ntested in accordance with NEMA Std. CC1, “Electric Power Connectors for Substations.”\n4.10.5.1.1  Bolted Connections :  Bolted connections are the primary means of making connections to\nequipment terminals.  Bolted joints permit the disconnection of equipment for maintenance or\nreplacement.\nThe most common bolted connection involves joining a conductor to an equipment terminal.  A terminal\nlug is attached to the conductor by clamping, compressing, or welding, and the lug is bolted to the\nequipment terminal.\nWhen a copper conductor is connected to a flat copper or electrical bronze equipment terminal, a copper\nor electrical bronze terminal lug is utilized.  The lug is usually bolted to the equipment terminal with a\nminimum of two ½-inch, 13 threads per inch, high-strength silicon bronze bolts normally torqued to\n54.23  newton-meters (40 pound-feet).

In smaller installations with\nfewer connections, it may not be economically feasible to weld connections.\n4.11 RIGID BUS DESIGN\n4.11.1  General Considerations\nThe design of a rigid bus system involves many factors.\n4.11.1.1  Bus Location in the Substation and Its Proximity to Other Equipment:   Provide ample\nclearance to permit equipment maintenance and removal.  Situate the bus to allow entrance of\nconstruction and maintenance equipment into the substation.\n4.11.1.2  Future Substation Expansion:  It is important to plan for future expansion by sizing and\npositioning buses to facilitate modifications.\n4.11.1.3  Conductor Selection:  The bus conductors are selected based on ampacity, physical\nproperties, and cost.  Select conductors so that they have sufficient size and capacity to withstand system\nfaults and overcurrents without damage from overheating.\n4.11.1.4  Short-Circuit Conditions:  During short circuits, large forces can be developed in the bus\nsystem.  The rigid bus design includes consideration of these forces to prevent damage during short-\ncircuit conditions.  The bus centerline-to-centerline spacing and the short circuit current both have effects\non these forces.\n4.11.1.5  Wind and Ice Load:  If not properly considered, wind and ice loads can cause extensive\ndamage to bus conductors and insulators.  The usual practice is to consider National Electrical Safety\nCode  loadings as a minimum.  Also consider local conditions since they may necessitate the use of more\nsevere loading criteria.\n4.11.1.6  Insulator Strength:  Since the number of different insulator ratings is limited, exercise care in\nthe bus layout so that a practical system is achieved.  The strength of the insulators required is based on\nthe total bus loading and particularly the short-circuit forces.\n4.11.1.7  Conductor Sag:  Limit the sag of the bus conductors in the design.  A flat horizontal system\nlooks much neater than one with excessive sag.  The conductor sag is influenced by the conductor weight\nand section modulus, the span length, and the vertical loading.\n4.11.1.8  Aeolian Vibration :  Long conductor spans can be damaged by vibrations caused by winds.\nExcessive conductor sag can add to this problem.  Span lengths whose natural frequency is near that set\nup by a wind that has a high recurrence should be avoided.  Use dampering conductors or other devices in\nthe bus to minimize vibration."

If the bus system is not provided with means to absorb this expansion, insulators or\nother connected equipment can be damaged.  A wide temperature range is required to accommodate the\nbus length when de-energized at the lowest design temperature up to the maximum bus operating\ntemperature.\n4.11.1.10  Location of Conductor Couplers:  Long buses usually require the use of more than one\nsection of conductor.  Consequently, couplers have to be utilized to join the sections together.  These\ncouplers have to be properly located to prevent damage from bus loading and short-circuit forces.\nPlan the bus system carefully by considering these aspects and other factors as they may develop.  This\nsection deals with the design of the conductor and support insulator systems.  For data concerning\nsupporting structures, refer to Chapter 7.\n4.11.2  Procedure for Rigid Bus Design\nThe following procedure can be used in designing a rigid bus system:\n4.11.2.1  Material and Size Selection:  Select the material and size of the bus conductors based on\ncontinuous current requirements.  In higher voltage systems with longer bus spans, the structural\ncapabilities of the conductors may be the factor that determines the conductor material and size.\nHowever, the conductors selected have to be capable of carrying the required continuous current in any\ncase.\n4.11.2.2  Spacing:  Using Tables 4-7 and 4-8, determine the bus conductor centerline-to-centerline\nspacing.\n4.11.2.3  Short-Circuit Forces:  Calculate the maximum short circuit forces the bus has to withstand.\nThese forces can be determined using Equation 4-4 :\nEquation 4-4\nWhere:\nFSC = Maximum short-circuit force on center conductor for a three-phase flat bus configuration\nof round or square tubular conductors with the conductors equally spaced, in newtons per\nmeter (pounds per foot)\nKSC = Short-circuit force reduction factor (0.5 to 1.0; 0.67 recommended)\ni = rms value of three-phase symmetrical short-circuit current, in amperes\nD = Centerli ne-to-centerline spacing of bus conductors in centimeters (inches)\n4.11.2.4  Loading:  Determine the total bus conductor loading.

It is recommended\nthat expansion fittings used on long horizontal buses be limited to those permitting longitudinal expansion\nonly.\nIt is usually desirable to limit the length of sections of continuous buses to 30.48 meters (100 feet) or less\nto limit the amount of conductor expansion in each section.  This can be done by fixing certain points in\nthe bus and permitting other points to move freely.  An example of a typical bus system is diagrammed in\nFigure 4-23.\nFigure 4-23:  Typical Bus System Illustrating Provisions for Conductor Thermal Expansion\nThe system illustrated in Figure 4-23 can freely expand as necessary and is free of “captured spans” that\npermit no expansion.  The locations of slip-fit and fixed bus supports and expansion-type couplers or bus\nsupports divide the bus into four sections, each of which will expand approximately the same totalTΔ=Δ lla"

If it is desirable to connect the end sections of the bus to other equipment, provide flexible\nconductors or expansion-type connectors.\n4.11.2.9  Couplers:  Locate conductor couplers.  The couplers used on rigid buses should be as long as\npossible to provide maximum joint rigidity and strength.  Clamp-type bolted couplers should have the\nquantity and size of clamping bolts listed in NEMA Std. CC1.  Welded couplers for aluminum conductors\nshould be of the internal type.  Compression connectors should be appropriately sized and located.\nTo prevent conductor damage from bending caused by its own weight and external loads, carefully\nposition couplers.  Welding and bolting can cause appreciable loss of conductor strength in the immediate\ncoupler locations.  Consequently, position couplers where the least amount of bending will occur.  The\nideal locations are points of zero bending moment along the conductor.\nTable 4-13 lists the ideal locations for conductor couplers for continuous conductors.\nTable 4-13:  Ideal Locations for Couplers in Continuous Uniformly Loaded Rigid Conductors\nQuantity\nof Conductor SpansIdeal Coupler Locations Measured to\nthe Right from the Left-most Support\n1 *\n2 0.750L, 1.250L\n3 0.800L, 1.276L, 1.724L, 2.200L\n4 0.786L, 1.266L, 1.806L, 2.194L\n2.734L, 3.214L\n5 0.789L, 1.268L, 1.783L, 2.196L,\n2.804L, 3.217L, 3.732L, 4.211L\n6 0.788L, 1.268L, 1.790L, 2.196L,\n2.785L, 3.215L, 3.804L, 4.210L,\n4.732L, 5.212L\nL=Distance of the bus between the bus supports.\n*The zero moment locations for single-spa n simply supported conductors are at the supports.  Consequently,\ncouplers are not recommended.\nIf couplers have to be positioned in other than the ideal locations listed in Table 4-13, reduce the\nmaximum allowable fiber stress used in Section 4.11.2.5 by as much as 50 percent, depending on the\ndegree of variation from the ideal location, and recalculate the maximum span length used.  If the span\nlength being considered exceeds this maximum, reduce it as necessary.  Conductor couplers can now be\npositioned wherever convenient.\n4.11.2.10  Aeolian Conductor Vibration:  Aeolian conductor vibration is primarily the result of\nsteady low-velocity transverse winds striking the conductor and causing it to vibrate.  When the frequency\nof the driving force (wind) is approximately equal to the natural frequency of the bus span, resonance\noccurs.  The resulting vibrations can cause insulator damage.\nVibrations will occur in almost all bus spans independently of the conductor material, diameter, or length.\nIn short spans, the vibrations are usually of small enough magnitude to be neglected.  However, in spans\nlonger than about 6 meters (20 feet), methods for vibration damping should be considered."

    "content": "Bulletin 1724E-300\nPage 171\nTwo primary methods have been used to dampen aeolian vibrations.  The first and most widely used\nmethod consists of installing scrap cables in the horizontal buses.  When this method is used, it is\nnecessary that the cables be loose in the bus tubing to permit vertical movement.  If new cables are used,\nthey should be straightened prior to installation to prevent the cables from jamming against the tubing\nsides.  Additionally, end caps, preferably of the driven type, should be installed on the ends of the buses\ncontaining the damping cables to prevent horizontal cable movement out of the tubing.  To be effective,\ndamping cables should be installed for the entire bus length for buses where excessive vibration is\nsuspected.\nThe second method used to dampen aeolian vibrations consists of installing internal or external\nprefabricated bus dampers on the bus conductors.  Usually, one damper is installed in each bus span to\ncontrol the vibrations.  Location and installation should be in accordance with the manufacturer’s\ninstructions.\n4.11.3  Bus Design Example\nDesign a three-phase rigid bus with the following characteristics:\nTotal bus length: 45.72 meters (150 feet), assuming four equal spans of 11.43 m\n(37.5 ft)\nVoltage: 161 kV\nBIL:  750 kV\nInsulator type:  post\nContinuous current rating:  1800 amperes\nShort-circuit current: 24,000 rms symmetrical amperes\nAltitude: 304.8 m (1000 ft)\nNESC loading: heavy\nDisconnect switch connected to one end of bus\nExternal prefabricated dampers to control conductor vibration\n4.11.3.1  Material and Size Selection:  Select the material and size of the bus conductors.\nBased on the continuous current requirements, 7.6 cm (3 in.) IPS, schedule 40 6063-T6 aluminum alloy\n(1890 amperes) is selected with the following properties:\nWC (weight) = 38.2 N/m  (2.62 lb/ft)*; see Table 4-14\nd2 (outside diameter) = 8.89 centimeters  (3.50 inches); see Table 4-14\nI (moment of inertia) = 125.6 cm4  (3.017 in4); see Table 4-14\nE (modulus of elasticity) = 6.9 x 107 kPa (10 x 106 lb/in2)\nS (section modulus) = 28.2 cm3  (1.72 in3); see Table 4-14\nFB (maximum allowable fiber stress) = 1.38 x 105 kPa (20,000 lb/in2)\n*If damping cables are to be used to control conductor vibration, the cable weight has to be added to\nthe conductor weight.  In this example, external prefabricated dampers will be used for vibration\ncontrol."

Conductors have to be selected so that they have sufficient size and capacity to withstand system\nfaults and overcurrents without damage from overheating.\n4.12.1.4  Wind and Ice Load:  Wind and ice can increase conductor sags and tensions appreciably.\nThe usual practice is to consider National Electrical Safety Code  loadings as a minimum.  Local\nconditions should be considered since they may necessitate the use of more severe loading criteria.\n4.12.1.5  Insulator Strength:  The suspension insulators are selected based on the anticipated\nmaximum loading conditions.  The maximum loading for porcelain insulators should not exceed 40\npercent of the mechanical–electrical strength ratings listed in RUS IP 202-1.  The maximum loading for\nfiberglass insulators may not exceed 40 percent of the manufacturer’s strength ratings.\n4.12.1.6  Span Length:  The span length influences the conductor sag.  As the span length increases,\nthe sag increases if the same tension is maintained.  To limit the sag, the tensions can be increased.\nSprings can also be used to limit the tension and sag.\n4.12.1.7  Sag and Tension:  Strain buses are usually positioned above other substation equipment.\nConductor breakage could result in equipment damage or outage.  To prevent breakage and to minimize\nsupport structure size, the conductors are usually installed at tensions of approximately 13,350 newtons\n(3000 pounds) or less.  Sag may increase because of the deflection of support structures.\n4.12.1.8  Temperature Variations:  Temperature variations cause changes in conductor lengths.  As\nconductor temperature increases, the sag increases and the tension decreases.\n4.12.1.9  Tap Loads:  Taps from the conductors to other buses or equipment should be limited in\ntension to prevent damage to equipment.  The taps are usually installed as slack connections.\n4.12.2  Procedure for Strain Bus Design\nThe following procedure can be used to design a strain bus system:\n4.12.2.1  Material and Size Selection:  Select the material and size of the bus conductors, based on\ncontinuous current requirements.\n4.12.2.2  Spacing:  Using Tables 4-7 and 4-8 from Section 4.9, determine the bus conductor centerline-\nto-centerline spacing.  As explained in Section 4.9, the minimum metal-to-metal, bus centerline-to-\ncenterline, and minimum ground clearances listed in Table 4-7 should be increased at least 50 percent for\nnonrigid conductors.\n4.12.2.3  Suspension Insulators:  Select the quantity of suspension insulators from Table 4-6.\n4.12.2.4  Loading:  Determine the total bus conductor loading.

Methods for this\ncalculation can be found in conductor manufacturers’ literature.  In some cases the maximum sag may\noccur during the most severe loading condition.  For substation strain buses, the design tension is usually\nlimited to 13,350 newtons (3000 pounds) per conductor under the most severe loading to minimize the\nsize of support structures.  These conductor tensions have to be coordinated with the support structure\ndesigns to ensure compatibility under all loading conditions.  The tensions that will occur under unloaded\nconditions will be considerably less than the maximum.\nFor light loading conditions where ice loads are not considered, the maximum conductor sag may occur at\nthe highest conductor temperature when the conductor length is at a maximum.  For other loading\nconditions, sags should be determined for both high conductor temperatures and maximum loading so that\nadequate clearance from other equipment can be provided.\n4.12.2.6  Suspension Insulator Effect:  Calculate the suspension insulator effect on conductor sag.  For\nshort dead-ended spans, such as substation strain buses, the suspension insulators can have an appreciable\neffect on span sags.

Safety\n4.13.1  Size and Maneuverability of the Equipment\nOne of the primary advantages of mobile equipment is its ability to be used at more than one location.  To\naccommodate installation, adequate space has to be available to position and connect the equipment at all\nintended locations.  It may be impossible to use larger units in some locations without substantial\nmodifications because of the lack of sufficient space.\nSubstation entrances and access roads should be evaluated before committing particular equipment to the\nlocation in question.  Prior planning can save much time and facilitate installation.\n4.13.2  Installation Location and Provisions\nThe mobile transformer or substation location should permit primary and secondary connections as short\nas possible to the permanent substation equipment.  It is desirable to utilize bare conductors for the\nconnections.  Sometimes, insulated cables can be used where electrical clearances cannot be maintained\nor where connections are long.  The location should permit any required connections to be made quickly\nand safely without disturbing adjacent equipment.  The ease and speed of installation can be influenced\nby the proximity of energized equipment.\nSubstations for which mobile equipment has been designated should have provisions for installation of\nthe equipment.  The provisions can simply be terminals on permanent substation equipment or buses for\nconnecting the mobile equipment.  It may be desirable to include bus extensions and/or disconnect\nswitches in some substations to facilitate the connections, particularly if they may be made while the\nsubstation is energized.\nIf low-voltage ac or dc supplies are required, permanent facilities can be provided in the vicinity of where\nthe mobile equipment will be positioned.  A weatherproof cabinet containing any necessary terminal\nblocks, switches, or protective devices can be provided for terminating the low-voltage circuits.\nTemporary connections can be made from this cabinet to the control cabinet on the mobile equipment.\nConnections into the substation alarm system can also be provided in this or another cabinet.  Terminal\nblocks, test switches, indicating lamps, or any other necessary equipment can be located in the cabinet.\nProvisions for grounding the equipment can consist of terminals or ground rods connected to the main\ngrounding grid.\n4.13.3  Electrical Clearances\nMaintaining adequate electrical clearances between the mobile equipment, its connections, and other\nequipment is of prime importance.  Installation using bare conductors should not be considered for a\nlocation unless the minimum clearances listed in Tables 4-7 and 4-8 can be maintained.  Insulated\nconductors can be used in some locations if the minimum clearances cannot be maintained.\n4.13.4  Primary and Secondary Connections\nAll primary and secondary connections should be as short as possible and should be made with bolted\nconnections.  If possible, use bare conductors.  However, for situations where minimum electrical\nclearances cannot be maintained or where connections are long, insulated conductors can be employed."

They should be checked for sufficient length before\nconnecting either end.\nTemporary poles or structures may be required in some locations to facilitate the connections and\nmaintain clearances.  It is desirable to store any necessary equipment not part of the mobile unit at the\nsubstations, where required.\n4.13.5  Grounding\nAdequate grounding of mobile transformers and substations is extremely important for safe operation.  At\nleast two independent connections should be made between the trailer and the ground system.  The\nmobile equipment should be connected to the substation ground grid whenever it is close to the\nsubstation.  In situations where the  mobile is located a long distance from the substation and connection\nto the substation ground grid is impractical, a separate ground system has to be provided.\n4.13.6  Auxiliary System Requirements\nMobile unit transformers are usually designed for forced-cooled operation.  Some units can provide the\nlow voltage necessary for auxiliary equipment operation through the use of on-board supply transformers\nand equipment.  For units without these provisions, low-voltage supplies can be obtained from the\nsubstation station service system.\nBefore the substation station service system is used to supply mobile unit auxiliary systems, the voltage(s)\nrequired by the auxiliary systems has to be checked against those available at the substation for\ncompatibility.  The system should also be checked for adequate capacity.\nIf an external dc supply is necessary for power or control applications, the substation control battery can\nbe used.  The system should be checked for proper voltage and adequate capacity prior to utilization.\n4.13.7  Safety\nUnless the mobile equipment is completely contained within another fenced area, a separate fence should\nbe provided to surround the equipment.  The fence has to provide the same security and protection as\nwould a permanent substation fence.  Gates should be provided with adequate locking facilities.\nMobile equipment usually requires some assembly during installation.  Barriers and supports may require\ninstallation.  Some supporting members or braces used to protect the equipment during transit may have\nto be removed.  Assembly and installation should be in strict accordance with the manufacturer’s\ninstructions.\nThe equipment should be positioned on a level site and blocked to prevent movement.  Ground slope at\nthe installation location should not exceed the manufacturer’s recommendations.\n4.14  REFERENCES\nAluminum Company of America, Alcoa Aluminum Bus Conductor Handbook .

The following\nsections in this chapter deal with the many possible variations in equipment.  Procurement of major\npieces of equipment usually depends on a detailed technical specification often developed after\nconsultation with vendors.\nSelection of the major equipment requires the utmost consideration.  Cost, schedule, and performance\npenalties may be incurred as a result of improper selection.  The design process has great flexibility for\nchange in minor items, but very little can be done in the detailed substation design to overcome\ndeficiencies in major equipment selection.\n5.2 POWER TRANSFORMERS\n5.2.1  General\nThe primary function of a power transformer is to transform system voltage from one nominal level to\nanother.  The transformer has to  be capable of carrying (within the guidelines of ANSI/IEEE Std.\nC57.92) the power flow for its particular location in the system under various operating conditions and\ncontingencies, such as line or transformer outages.\nThis section deals primarily with oil-filled power transformers with nominal primary voltage ratings of\n230 kV and below and utilizing one of the following methods of cooling:\n1. Self-cooled (OA)\n2. Self-cooled and assisted by forced-air (OA/FA for one stage; OA/FA/FA for two stages)\n3. Self-cooled and assisted by  forced-air and forced-oil (OA/FA/FOA or OA/FOA/FOA for two\nstages)\nOther methods of cooling such as with water are available and are described in IEEE  Std. C57.12.00.\nThe type of cooling used is based on the requirements of the specifications, the size of the transformer,\nand the  manufacturer ’s standard design .\nMeeting these specific requirements usually results in the power transformer’s being the largest,\nheaviest, and most costly piece of equipment used in a substation.\nBecause of their great importance and complexity, power transformers require special care in their\napplication, specification, and procurement.  This is best accomplished by taking full advantage of\napplicable industry standards and guides of national organizations such as the American National\nStandards Institute (ANSI), Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE), National Electrical"

Most of\nthis discussion will apply to step-down transformers, especially those not included in the List of\nMaterials.  Refer to RUS Bulletin 50-91, “RUS Specification for Step-Down Distribution Substation\nTransformers,” for step-down transformers.\n5.2.2  Types\nPower transformers may be either autotransformers or multiwinding conventional transformers.  A\nthree-phase installation may consist of a three-phase unit or three single-phase units.  The decision as to\nwhat type of transformer to purchase depends on such factors as initial installed cost, maintenance\ncosts, operating cost (efficiency), reliability, etc.  Three-phase units have lower construction and\nmaintenance costs and can be built to the same efficiency ratings as single-phase units.  The initial cost\nof a three-phase transformer is usually approximately one-third less than four single-phase units.\nAdditionally, the exposure of three-phase units to long outages can be minimized system-wide when a\nmobile substation or transformer is available for backup in case of failure.  RUS Bulletin 61-16, “Guide\nfor Economic Evaluation of Distribution Transformers,” provides information for evaluating substation\ntransformer costs.\nThe kVA ratings  for various sizes of transformers are covered by the standards.  IEEE  Std. C57.12.00,\nTable 1, defines the preferred continuous ratings for both single - and three -phase units.   ANSI\nStd. C57.12.10, Tables 2 and 12, further define the ratings of transformers with and without cooling .\nTransformers 10,000 kVA and below can accommodate  one stage of cooling only , while transformers\nlarger than 10,000 kVA can include up to two stages of cooling.   Each stage of cooling increases the\ncapacity of the transformer by a fixed percentage of the base (OA) rating.   For three -phase transformer s\nrated between 750 and 2000  kVA, increasing the base level of cooling to  forced  air cooling will\nincrease the continuous kVA capacity  by 15 percent.  For t ransformers rated 2500  kVA to 10,000 kVA ,\nthe increase is 25 percent .  For transformers above 10,000 kVA, additional stages of cooling may be\nused to increase the continuous kVA rating of the transformer by 33 percent per stage.   Transformers\nlarger than those listed in these tables can be purchased and  would normally be triple rated or would\nhave provision for the future addition of two stages of cooling equipment to produce a triple rating.\nThe choice between conventional two- or three-winding transformers and autotransformers involves\ntheir basic differences as they may affect the application and cost factors.  In general, autotransformers\nare considered primarily because of cost advantages where the voltage transformation ratio is favorable,\nup to possibly 3/1.  Beyond this ratio, the cost advantage of autotransformers diminishes.  Also,\nautotransformers are wye connected and thus provide only an in-phase angular relationship between\nprimary and secondary voltages.\nOther advantages of autotransformers are smaller physical size, lighter weight, lower regulation\n(voltage drop in transformer), smaller exciting currents (easier no-load switching), and lower losses.\nThe main disadvantages of autotransformers are lower reactance (impedance), more complex design\nproblems, and adverse affect on ground relaying.  These problems can usually be resolved."

The selection should consider the effects of load cycle, load\nfactor, and ambient temperature as described in ANSI/IEEE Std. C57.92, “Guide for Loading Mineral\nOil-Immersed  Power Transformers up to and Including 100 MVA With 55°C or 65 °C Average\nWinding  Rise. ”\nSince cooling efficiency decreases with increase in altitude, the transformer manufacturer should be\ninformed when the transformer will be operated at an elevation above 1000 meters (3300 feet) so that\nthe proper cooling system can be provided.  See  Table s 5-1 and 5-2 for guidance on the effect of\naltitude on temperature rise.  Also, multiwinding transformers with loads on various windings at\ndifferent power factors have higher load losses and may require additional cooling capacity.\nTable 5-1:  Maximum Allowable Average Temperature* of Cooling Air for Carrying Rated kVA.\nRef.

Since no-load taps are not\ncapable of interru pting any current including transformer charging current , the transformers have to be\nde-energized when the manual no-load tap position is changed.

When load tap\nchanging transformers are specified, they have to comply with the requirements of ANSI/ IEEE\nStd. C57.12.00, and ANSI/IEEE Std. C57.12.10 .\n5.2.5  Impedance\nTransformer impedance affects transformer voltage regulation, efficiency, and magnitude of through-\nshort-circuit currents.  Both regulation and efficiency are generally improved with lower impedance.\nHowever, these desirable results should be viewed along with higher through-fault currents permissible\nwith lower impedance.\nHigher load-side fault currents can be potentially damaging to the transformer and may also require\nhigher fault current ratings of load-side equipment at increased cost.  Prudent compromises are thus\noften required in specifying transformer impedance .\nWhere through-fault currents are not a significant factor, it is generally desirable to specify as low\nimpedance as possible that will not result in increased transformer cost.  Standard  impedance ranges for\nvarious transformer BIL ratings are listed by manufacturers, and cost penalties may apply when the\nimpedance fall s above or below these ranges .  The standards permit manufacturing tolerances of\n±7.5 percent of the specified impedance for two-winding transformers and ±10.0 percent for\nmultiwinding transformers and autotransformers.  These are important to remember if transformer\nparalleling is being considered  and if the margin between transformer through-fault current and\nequipment ratings is  very close .  Substation transformer impedance needs to comply with the\nrequirements of ANSI/IEEE Std.  C57.12.10, Section 6.  Standard  impedances  for various voltage\nratings are given in Table 5-11.  Distribution substation transformers (500 kVA or smaller) should be\nspecified with standard impedance  where possible.  These impedances  are sufficient to make the\ntransformer self protecting under any secondary faults.\n5.2.6  Phase Relation\nProper phase relationships between the various winding voltages are extremely important in transformer\napplication.  These have to be selected to fit existing or planned conditions in the particular system.\nStandard single-phase substation transformers are built with subtractive polarity.  The polarity of a\nthree-phase transformer is fixed by its connections between phases and by relative location of leads.  A\nstandard delta-wye or wye-delta, three-phase, step-down transformer will result in the high-side\nvoltages leading their respective low-side voltages by 30 degrees.  An installation of three single-phase\ntransformers can be connected to accomplish this same relationship.\nAutotransformers are connected wye-wye, and no phase angle exists between the high- and low-side\nvoltages.  This may preclude the use of autotransformers, in some cases, even when they are otherwise\npreferred.  See Section 5.2 .7 concerning  the phase relationship required for parallel operation  of\ntransformers.\nAlso give attention to the proper physical orientation of transformers within the substation and to their\nconnections to ensure that the proper phasing is obtained on all buses.  Standard bushing arrangement\non a three-phase transformer, when viewed from the low-voltage side, is from left to right H 0 (when\nrequired), H l, H2, and H 3 on the high-voltage side and X 0 (when required), X 1, X2, and X 3 on the low-\nvoltage side.  If a tertiary or third winding is provided, the bushing arrangement is Y 1, Y2, and Y 3 left to\nright when viewed from the side nearest these bushings."

Two transformers will cost more than a single\ntransformer of equivalent capacity, their combined losses are higher, and they require a more elaborate\nand expensive substation structure to accommodate them.  However, where a situation exists for\npossible parallel operation, such as where continuity of at least partial service in event of failure of one\nunit is of great importance, the transformers should be individually  protected and the following\nguidelines considered.\nAny two or more transformers can be operated in parallel, provided  their  impedances are in the same\norder of magnitude when considered on their own kVA base, their voltage taps and voltage ratios are\nessentially the same, and their polarity and phase voltage displacement are or can be made alike.\nEqual impedances will permit proportionate sharing of the load between transformers.  If not equal, the\nload will be divided in inverse proportion to the magnitude of the impedance .  This condition is"

However, if the smaller unit has the lower impedance, it will carry more than its\nshare of the load and may even become severely overloaded, while the larger unit still has available\ncapacity.  This is demonstrated in the following example.\nProtecting transformers operating in parallel as a single unit is not recommended.  The sensitivity of the\nhigh-side protection is significantly reduced, and the occurrence of nuisance tripping during\nenergization is increased due to incorrect differential relay harmonic restraint unit operation.\n5.2.7.1  Condition I - Larger Transformer Has the Smaller Impedance:   Two transformers, Tl\nand T2, are operating in parallel.  Tl is rated 10 MVA  with an impedance of 10 percent.  T2 is rated 25\nMVA  with an impedance of 7 percent.  On a common 100 MVA base, impedance of Tl is 100 percent\nand impedance of T2 is 28 percent.\nPower flow divides inversely with the relative impedances on a common base.  Assuming a total power\nflow of 30 MVA , Tl would carry 6.6 MVA  and T2 would carry 23.4 MVA , both within their ratings.\nThe power flow distribution is obtained by solving two simultaneous equations, where Pl and P2\nrepresent the power flows through Tl and T2, respectively, and Z100 is the impedance on a 100 MVA\nbase:\nEquation 5-1\nPl + P2 = 30 MVA\nEquation 5-2\nP\nPZ ofT\nZ ofT1\n22\n1100\n100=()\n( )\n5.2.7.2  Condition II - Smaller Transformer Has the Smaller Impedance:   The same as\nCondition I, except Tl has an impedance of 7 percent, and T2 an impedance of 10 percent.  On a\n100 MVA  base, the impedance of Tl is 70 percent and the impedance of T2 is 40 percent.\nTl would carry 10.9 MVA  and T2 would carry 10.1 MVA .  Tl is clearly overloaded, whereas T2 has\ncapacity to spare.\n5.2.7.3  Condition III - Both Transformers Have Equal Impedances - Preferred Condition :\nThe same as Condition I, except both TI and T2 have equal impedances on their own base of  8 percent.\nOn a 100 MVA  base, Tl has an impedance of 80 percent, and T2 has an impedance of 32 percent.  TI\nwould carry 8.6 MVA  and T2 would carry 21.4 MVA .  Each transformer is carrying its correct share in\nproportion to its MVA  rating.\nFrom an impedance standpoint, it has generally been accepted that transformers can be paralleled\nsuccessfully if the actual or nameplate impedance of one does not differ by more than 7 ½ percent from\nthe actual or nameplate impedance of the other.

But unequal tap voltages will create a circulating current flowing forward through the\nunit having the higher voltage and in a reverse or leading direction through the unit with the lower\nvoltage.  This condition is limited only by the series impedance of the two transformers in the current\ncirculation circuit and by the difference in voltage causing the current flow.  This condition can be very\nsevere and has to be closely analyzed whenever such operation is contemplated.  The condition is most\nsevere when the transformers are not carrying load.  It usually is modified sufficiently when load is\nbeing carried, and voltage regulation due to load so modifies the voltage difference as to reduce the\ncirculating current to an insignificant level.\nWhere paralleled transformers are equipped with load tap changers and line drop compensators,\nincorporate paralleling control schemes into the LTC controls.  Schemes that may be evaluated include:\n1.Negative Reactance Method\n2. Step-by-Step Method\n3. Out-of-Step Switch Method\n4. Cross-Current Compensation Method\n5.2.8  Dielectric Requirements\nA transformer in service may be exposed to a variety of dielectric stresses.  Lightning impulses may\nreach the terminals of the transformer because of direct hits or, more likely, in the form of traveling\nwaves coming in over connecting lines.  Such traveling waves are produced when the connecting lines\nare exposed to lightning strokes.\nDirect hits are practically impossible where adequate direct stroke protection is provided over the\nsubstation in the form of ground wires and/or masts.  The magnitude of traveling wave impulses\nreaching the transformer depends on:\n• The initial magnitude of the strokes\n• The distance the wave has to travel\n• Transmission line characteristics, such as surge impedance, insulation level, and type of\nground wire protection\n• Transformer characteristics and protective characteristics of surge protective devices\nprovided\nHow well the transformer can withstand any impulse voltages reaching it depends on the condition of\nthe insulation at the time of the impulse.  Basic insulation levels can be verified by impulse tests.  Most\nlarge transformers receive impulse tests prior to shipment from the factory.   This may not be a routine\ntest performed by the manufacturer for certain size transformers. If an impulse test is desired, include\nthis requirement in the testing section  of the transformer specifications.\nNormal line energization and deenergization or power circuit breaker operations during system faults\nproduce switching surges that travel down the conductors to the connected transformers.  Switching\nsurges generally present no particular problem to transformers rated 230 kV and below.  Transformers\nrated 115 kV and above are designed for the switching  impulse insulation levels (BSL)  associated with\ntheir assigned BIL.  Switching impulse insulation levels are defined in Tables 5-12 and 5-13 .  In"

C57.12.90 now includes  an entire section on short -circuit\ntesting of transformers.  \nIn brief, the standard  requires the application of six short circuits at maximum current, two of which\nwould result in maximum asymmetry of the fault current based on the reactance  to resistance (x/r) ratio\nto the point of the fault as defined in ANSI/ IEEE Std. C57.12.00,  Section 7.   The transformer should\nshow no damage after this test as indicated by measurements and visual inspections.  For a complete\ndescription of the test, refer to ANSI /IEEE  Std. C57.12.90 , “Standard Test Code for Liquid-Immersed\nDistribution, Power, and Regulating Transformers and Guide for Short Circuit Testing of Distribution\nand Power  Transformer s.”\nThe user has to still decide whether to require this test in the purchase specifications.  Manufacturers ’\nfacilities or test laboratories may be limited in terms of the size of transformer that can be short -circuit\ntested.  Larger sizes conceivably could be tested in the field by the purchaser, but the feasibility of\ndoing so on an operating system is questionable.  The laboratory test is fairly costly , and shipping costs"

Cooperatives need not require short- circuit tests for transformers\nin this category.  RUS will either request manufacturers to conduct short-circuit tests on any new\ntransformer design proposed for listing or will request evidence that the transformer design has had a\nhistory of successful experience in service.  The cooperative should not specify unusual taps or\nimpedance in the purchase specification unless absolutely necessary.  Such requirements may cause\ndesign changes that will affect mechanical strength and introduce uncertainties in the ability of the\ntransformer to withstand short-circuit currents.\nSpecifications for transformers not included in the List of Materials* should include requirements for\nshort-circuit strength.  The manufacturer should be required to demonstrate this strength either directly\nthrough previous short-circuit testing of a similar unit or indirectly through a history of successful field\nexperience.\nIt should be recognized that short-circuit testing will not be feasible on the larger sizes of transformers\nbecause of the limitations of existing laboratory facilities.  Hence, successful experience will be the\nprincipal means for measuring the adequacy of short-circuit strength of these transformers.  In this\nrespect, it is recommended that experience be accepted as a demonstration that the transformer design\nhas adequate short-circuit strength .  This applies only when transformers with core and coils identical in\nall respects to the transformer covered by the specifications have amassed a total of at least 20\ntransformer years of experience without major failure attributable to design defects.\nWhere the manufacturer has not built units identical to the transformer covered by the specification, or\nthe experience record is less than 20 transformer  years , it is recommended that short -circuit testing be\nrequired by the specifications or a different manufacturer  be selected .\n5.2.9.3  Recommended Specification for Short-Circuit Strength:   It is recommended that the\nfollowing be incorporated in all purchase specifications for power transformers not included in the List\nof Materials:\n“Without limiting in any way any obligation of the Bidder under this agreement, the Bidder\nshall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Owner that the transformer proposed to be\nfurnished under this specification shall have sufficient mechanical strength to withstand\nwithout failure all through-fault currents.

A description of the test code under which the transformer was tested for\nshort-circuit strength will be provided by the Bidder to the Owner.\n2. A history of successful experience with transformers of identical or similar ratings, design,\nand construction.

Information submitted  shall include\nthe dates of installation (or shipment, if not installed), the ratings of the transformers, and a\nlist of failures and causes of failures if any have been experienced.”\nAutotransformers or conventional multiwinding transformers often have special application and design\nrequirements.  In such cases, it will be important to provide system short-circuit information indicating\nthe most severe short-circuit condition that can exist at the terminals of each transformer winding, and\nany specific impedance requirements.\n5.2.10  Cooling Equipment\nMost of the smaller substation power transformers on rural systems are the oil-immersed, self-cooled\n(OA) type.  In these types of transformers, the oil transfers the heat from the core and coils to the tank\nwall or cooling tubes, where it passes to the surrounding air.  Temperature differences in the oil cause\nthe oil to circulate by convection through the tubes.  Adequate airflow  is essential to satisfactory\noperation.\nOn larger transformers, this cooling process can be accelerated by various methods: using forced air\n(FA) from fans over the cooling tubes, by using oil pumps to circulate the oil, or by a combination of\nforced air and forced oil. Both methods can be automatically controlled in one or two steps from either\ntop oil temperatures or winding temperature or both.  Forced cooling methods are usually effective in\nreducing costs of the larger transformer sizes.\nWhere any type of forced cooling is relied on, it is essential that attention be given to adequate\noperational reliability of the pumps and fans.  This involves consideration of redundancy in the power\nsupply to the pumps and fans and to individual or group overload protection and disconnecting means.\nAlso, hot spot and top oil temperature devices can be used to alarm for abnormal cooling indications.\nThe temperature limits should be specified to adequately protect the unit but not to limit its overload\ncapability.  Suggested alarm limits are listed in Table 5-14:\nTable 5-14:  Alarm Limits for Transformer Cooling\n55°C 65°C\nInsulation Insulation\nHottest Spot Temperature 95°C 105°C\nTop Oil Temperature 70°C   80°C"

In this case, shutoff valves and bolted flanges are provided at\nthe inlet and outlet of each heat exchanger.  Transformers below a range of 10,000 kVA, three-phase,\nand 5,000 kVA, single-phase, usually have nonremovable cooling tubes.  These kVA sizes will vary\nbetween manufacturers.\n5.2.11  Oil and Oil Preservation Equipment\nTransformer oil has to be kept free from contact with outside contaminants always present in the\natmosphere.  On smaller substation transformers, the tank is completely sealed, with a layer of dry air or\nnitrogen left above the oil to accommodate expansion and contraction of the oil.\nSeveral methods of oil preservation (see Figure  5-1) are commonly used on larger size transformers:\n1. A sealed tank with a positive pressure inert gas layer maintained above the oil by means of a\npermanently connected tank of nitrogen gas\n2. A tank completely filled with oil but connected to a raised tank or oil conservator, which\nmaintains a positive oil pressure in the main tank and provides a place for expansion and\ncontraction of the oil\n3. A conservator tank with a divided expansion tank with two sections and the flexible diaphragm\nconservator tank\n4. A conservator tank with a bladder within the conservator tank as a variation of the flexible\ndiaphragm\nThe choice of oil preservation system is mostly a matter of personal preference and experience.  All\nhave been successfully used for many years.  Regardless of the method used, periodic tests have to be\nmade of the oil and oil preservation system to ensure that oil quality is being maintained.\n5.2.12  Audible Sound\nSound (noise) levels produced by transformers, as well as other substation equipment, are becoming a\nmatter of increasing concern to the public.  The fact that rural substations are more often located away\nfrom congested areas reduces the possibility of complaints.  However, this is partially offset by the\nlower ambient sound levels common in rural areas.\nIn some areas, noise ordinances may dictate what is required.  The designer should accordingly be\nfamiliar with the problems and their solutions.  A thorough treatment of the subject is beyond the scope\nof this bulletin, but some practical guidelines follow.  Any values given should be treated as\napproximations.\n5.2.12.1  Site:   Sound is usually transmitted radially from the source.  Avoid sites that have a direct\nline of sight to possible areas of complaints.  A particularly poor selection would be a low-level site\nwith residential areas on the surrounding higher ground.\n5.2.12.2  Landscape :  Natural or artificial barriers such as mounds or shrubbery positioned between\nthe sound source and the public are desirable.  Although these have little effect on sound levels, they\ncan reduce the psychological impact of a new substation and prevent complaints."

TR1.  See\nTables 5-15 (see page 213 of this bulletin), 5-16, and 5-17.  Reduced sound level transformers may\nincrease the transformer cost approximately 1 ½ percent for each dBA reduction from these NEMA\nstandard levels.  Actual price variations for different sound levels can only be determined in a bid\nprocess when all other design factors are considered.  Transformer sound levels tend to increase with\nBIL, kVA, and the number of stages of cooling.  A practical limit in designing special low-sound-level\ntransformers is approximately a 12-dB A reduction where forced cooling is required.

Dielectric tests are generally specified only on the larger sizes\nof transformers or on smaller transformers used in especially important applications.  Most manufacturers\ncharge for these tests.  Table  5-18 provides guidelines for specifying dielectric tests.\n5.2.15.1.1  Full Wave Impulse Test :  The full wave impulse test (1.2 x 50 -microsecond  wave) is\ndesigned to simulate a lightning stroke.  Because of its relatively long duration, the full wave impulse test\ncauses major oscillations to develop in the winding.  Consequently,  not only turn-to-turn and section-to-\nsection insulation are stressed throughout the winding but relatively high voltages  can result , compared to\npower frequency stresses, across large portions of the winding and between the winding and ground (core\nand adjacent windings)."

It is designed to simulate a lightning stroke\ntruncated by a flashover on an adjacent portion of the insulation system.  This test generally does not\nproduce as high voltages across large portions of the winding or between the winding and ground.\nHowever, because of its greater amplitude, it produces high voltages at the line end of the winding and,\nbecause of the rapid change of voltage following flashover of the test gap, it produces higher turn-to-turn\nand section-to-section stresses.\n5.2.15.1.3  Front-of-Wave Impulse Test :  The front-of-wave impulse test (similar to the chopped\nwave test but chopped on the front and with a much steeper front) is still shorter in duration and produces\nstill lower winding-to-ground voltages deep within the winding.  Near the line end, however, its greater\namplitude produces higher voltages from winding to ground, and this, combined with the rapid change of\nvoltage on the front and following flashover, produces high turn-to-turn and section-to-section voltages\nnear the line end of the winding.\n5.2.15.1.4  Switching Surge Test :  The switching surge test is related to the other impulse tests, but\nhas a much longer wave front and tail.  This slow wave fully penetrates the windings and stresses all parts\nof the insulation structure.\n5.2.15.1.5  Applied Voltage Test :  An applied voltage test measures the ability of the transformer to\nsurvive at normal frequency overvoltage.  It also determines the increase in exciting current.\n5.2.15.1.6  Induced Voltage Test :  An induced voltage test measures the insulation strength between\nturns in the winding and the insulation strength of barriers and other major insulation between phases.\nDuring this test, a partial discharge (corona) test can be conducted to determine presence, inception, and\nextinction levels of partial discharges that may be damaging to the insulation structure and eventually lead\nto failure.\nThe partial discharge (corona) test consists of measuring the 1 megahertz (by agreement between\nmanufacturers and users) portion of any pulses produced within the transformer during low-frequency"

A calibration procedure is used to convert the tap readings to an equivalent value at the\nbushing terminal.\n5.2.15.2  Measurements (Electrical):   Measurements that produce data required for operation of the\ntransformer include resistance, core and conductor losses, excitation current, impedance, ratio and\nregulation temperature rise, insulation power factor, polarity and phase relation, etc.  Consult ANSI /IEEE\nStd. C57.12.90  for detailed information regarding these test measurements.\n5.2.16  Shipment\nSeveral shipping considerations are important.  During shipping, the transformer may be subjected to its\nmost severe test due to rough handling.  Acceleration measuring devices (impact recorder) mounted on\nthe transformer during shipment will help to determine whether the transformer may have been subjected\nto excessive forces.  In any case, make a thorough inspection of the interior of the transformer to\ndetermine whether movement of the core and coils has taken place or whether evidence of any other\ndamage exists.\nLarger size transformers are shipped without oil but sealed with either a blanket of nitrogen gas or dry air.\nThe method used often varies with the transformer manufacturer.  Either method is considered\nsatisfactory, provided proper safety precautions are taken and warning signs are exhibited to deter a\nperson from entering an unsafe tank before it has been purged with proper amounts of air or oxygen.\nIt is good practice to provide the manufacturer with all necessary information regarding the situation at\nthe final destination.  This will enable shipment to be made in the most convenient way.  Sometimes it is\nimportant for the transformer to be positioned a particular way by the final carrier to facilitate unloading\nat the site.\n5.2.17  Warranty\nIn general, transformer manufacturers warrant their product to be free of defects in workmanship an d\nmaterial for a specified period.  In the event of a defect, the manufacturer may elect to correct the problem\nat his option either by repairing the defective part or parts or by supplying a repaired or replacement part\nor parts.  Under terms of a normal warranty, the manufacturer assumes no responsibility for disassembly\nor reassembly of the equipment or return transportation from the field to the factory and back to the field.\nSince warranties are subject to many variables, the purchaser is cautioned to exercise care in review and\nevaluation of each one.  Warranty periods vary from one to five years or more.  Special warranties are\navailable, at some increase in purchase price, that extend the warranty period and/or include the cost of\nremoving a failed transformer from the field, returning it to the factory, repair, return to the field,\nreinstallation in the field, etc.\n5.2.18  Core and Coils\nTransformers can be classified by two different forms of construction:  “core form” or “shell form.”  Most\ncommon is the core-form type manufactured either with cylindrical coils wrapped horizontally around a\ncylindrical core or with rectangular coils and a rectangular core.  Core-form transformers have excellent"

Shell-form transformers were developed for very large, high-\nmagnitude short-circuit application such as generator step-up transformers.\n5.2.19  Specifications\nPurchase specifications should be based on standards of national organizations such as ANSI, IEEE,\nNEMA, etc.  However, when the desired power transformer is included in RUS IP 202-1 , “List of\nMaterials Acceptable for Use on Systems of RUS Electrification Borrowers,” specification need only\ncover such details as voltage, kVA ratings, optional tests, and features or accessories that are offered by\nthe manufacturer and considered necessary or desirable.  The basic requirements for transformers in the\nList of Materials are given in the ANSI/IEEE Standards C57 series and should not be included in the\npurchase specification.  The latest List of Materials includes step-down power transformers in the\nfollowing sizes and voltage ratings:\nPrimary Voltage Rating  Capacity, kVA\nSingle-Phase 138 kV and below 10,000 kVA (OA) and below\nThree-Phase 138 kV and below 30,000 kVA (OA) and below\nPurchase specifications for transformers that are not included in the List of Materials should be detailed\nenough to provide reasonable assurance that the transformer will be suitable for its intended use.  In\ngeneral, the specification should be based on functional and operational requirements rather than\nconstruction and design requirements, since the latter are properly the responsibility of the manufacturer.\nIt is very important that the user  review the “usual” and “unusual” operating conditions listed in “General\nRequirements Standards” such as ANSI/ IEEE  Std. C57.12.00 and ANSI/IEEE C57.12.01. Any unusual or\nspecial operating or environmental condition should be made known to the manufacturer.\nIt is recommended that the purchase specifications be modeled on or checked against the requirements of\nANSI Std. C57.97, “Guide for Preparation of Specifications for Large Power Transformers, With or\nWithout Load Tap Changing.”  In addition, it is recommended that a special requirement for short-circuit\ncurrent strength be included such as given in Section 5.2.9, Short-Circuit Requirements.  The\nmanufacturer’s standard design should be accepted, and standard sizes, ratings, taps, and accessories\nshould be specified, unless there is a good reason for doing otherwise.\nTo assist in the evaluation of transformers being offered in a particular case, it is desirable to include in\nthe request for bids the method for evaluation of transformer losses.  This should be patterned after RUS\nBulletin 1724E-301, “Guide for the Evaluation of Large Power Transformer Losses.”  This information\nwill also assist the manufacturer in its efforts to offer the type of transformer desired.\n5.2.20   References\nANSI Std.

This discussion is limited to circuit breakers rated 1000 volts and above.  (Automatic circuit\nreclosers are discussed in Section 5.9.)"

In some instances, protective devices of lesser capability and\nflexibility, such as fuses, circuit switchers, reclosers, etc., may be more desirable or preferred over more\ncomplex and costly circuit breakers.\nFuses are often desirable for transformer protection at any location where they are adequate for the\nthermal load and short-circuit conditions because of their lower cost and smaller space requirements\ncompared to other devices.  They are also desirable for their ease of coordination with circuit breakers and\nrelays at other locations on the electric system.  Fuses can also be applied as temporary maintenance\nbypass protection to permit maintenance of circuit breakers.  Fuses are also used extensively for\nsectionalization and branch circuit protection in distribution systems.\nCircuit switchers are less costly than circuit breakers and can be applied in much the same way as circuit\nbreakers, subject to limitations in interrupting capability, with the same type of relay control as circuit\nbreakers.  Circuit switchers are also supplied without current transformers (circuit breakers are usually\nsupplied with CTs), which are used in conjunction with relays to sense faults.  They can be substituted for\nfuses in transformer bank protection to detect low-voltage-side faults that fuses may not be able to detect.\nThis detection would utilize relay intelligence from the low-voltage side.  Circuit switchers also provide\nexcellent capacitor bank switching and protection.  In outlying areas of moderate short-circuit capacity,\nthey can often be substituted for circuit breakers.  They can be mounted similarly to air-break switches on\na substation structure and thus require little or no additional space.\nReclosers are completely self-contained and provide excellent distribution circuit exit and feeder\nprotection.  Their ratings are adequate for both load and short circuit on most distribution circuits and\noverlap the ratings of more costly circuit breakers.  Their operation is faster than most circuit breakers,\nand their sequence of open and close operations is very flexible.  Reclosers are available in both single-\nand three-phase ratings so that they are very useful and adaptable for the entire distribution system at\nlocations where reclosing operation is required.\nWriting of specifications and selection of power circuit breakers and similar devices should be preceded\nby electric system studies to determine the parameters of application and operation that have to be\nsatisfied.  These include load flow, short-circuit, transient voltage, coordination, and protection studies.\n5.3.1.2  Specification—General Requirements:   Power circuit breakers are not included in RUS’s\n“List of Materials.”  Therefore, for each application, a detailed specification is necessary.  A functional\nspecification describing the circuit breaker rating and control, electric system characteristics and any\nspecial requirements is preferred to one describing design and construction details.  ANSI Std. C37.12,\n“American National Standard Guide Specifications for AC High-Voltage Circuit Breakers Rated on a\nSymmetrical Current Basis and a Total Current Basis,” can be used directly as a model or checklist for the\npurchase specification.  A manufacturer’s standard design and construction would normally be considered\nacceptable.\nIt is recommended that those persons responsible for preparing power circuit breaker specifications\nbecome familiar with:\n1. The C37 series of ANSI Standards covering ratings, testing, applications, specifications, etc.\n2. Each specific application and proposed installation\n3. Each prospective supplier’s product line of circuit breakers"

This column, besides serving as an insulating\nsupport, may act as an access for the operating rod or linkage and, in the case of air circuit breakers, it\nacts as an air supply duct.  Most circuit breakers above 242 kV are of “live tank” construction.  However,\nsome dead tank-type units are in use.\nIn addition to classification as “live tank” or “dead tank” construction, circuit breakers are also classified\nin terms of interrupting media.  Breakers are also classified as three-pole, single-throw, and independent-\npole operation.  Three-pole single-throw breakers utilize one mechanical device to trip all three poles with\na linkage to gang the operation together (see Figure 5-4).  With independent-pole operation, each pole is\nequipped with the mechanical means to trip its individual pole (see Figure 5-5).  Although availability of\ndifferent breaker designs is closely related to the state of the art at any particular time, Table 5-19\nindicates the known availability of breaker types.\nTable 5-19:  Types of Circuit Breakers\nAvailability vs. Interrupting Media\nOutdoor Oil (1) Air Gas Vacuum\nDead Tank\nSingle Tank X X X\nThree Tank X X X\nLive Tank\nIndoor X\nDead Tank X X X\n(1) Oil circuit breakers are only available as remanufactured or used equipment.\nNo general guidelines can be drawn for the application of these various types of circuit breakers.  Each\nuser has to determine the ratings of circuit breakers required and then select a type of circuit breaker\nacceptable with regard to rating, performance expectations, compatibility with planned or existing\nsubstation configuration, and the ability to install, operate, and maintain the circuit breaker.  Cost may\nalso be an important consideration in the final selection.\nMost, but not all, domestic circuit breakers in outdoor substations of 2.4 kV through 24.9 kV utilize a\nvacuum technology as the insulating dielectric to interrupt load and fault currents (see Figure 5-6).\nAlthough outdoor vacuum breakers can be supplied for voltages up to 38 kV, SF 6 is more commonly used\nfor voltages from 34.5 kV to 765 kV."

Although SF 6 breakers are available in single-tank designs, the trend is\ntoward three-tank.  SF 6 breaker manufacturers have been able to reduce the size of the interrupting\nchambers, making the three-tank design more economical.\nSF6 circuit breakers are available with three operating mechanisms: pneumatic, hydraulic, and spring-\noperated. Some circuit breaker manufacturers have models for each of the operating mechanisms.\nBecause of the differences between manufacturers and operating mechanisms, a discussion of\nmaintenance and inspection procedures has been left up to the individual manufacturers.  Although there\nare many differences, most circuit breakers require the bushings to be removed to expose the interrupting\nmechanism for inspection and maintenance.\nAlthough there are a number of oil circuit breakers still in service, with the developments in SF 6 and\nvacuum technology, oil breakers are being phased out.  Some companies sell oil breakers, but as used and\nreconditioned breakers.\n5.3.3  Ratings\nThe rating of a circuit breaker is a summary of its characteristics that identifies its application on an\nelectric system, its performance capabilities, and its adaptability.  This summary of characteristics is\ngiven principally in terms of voltages, currents, and time as described in the rating tables, in the ANSI\nC37 Standards, and in the following subsections.\n5.3.3.1  Voltage:   Voltage characteristics are defined in terms of rms nominal, rms rated maximum,\nrated voltage range factor, and rated dielectric strength.\n5.3.3.1.1  Nominal Voltage :  Nominal voltage, also known as voltage class, is used to identify the\ngeneral voltage class or electric system voltage on which a particular circuit breaker was intended for\napplication.\n5.3.3.1.2  Rated Maximum Voltage :  Rated maximum voltage is the maximum voltage for which the\ncircuit breaker is designed and is also the upper limit for operation on an electric system.  It is based on\nANSI Std. C84.1, “American National Standard Voltage Ratings for Electric Power Systems and\nEquipment (60 Hz),” and ANSI Std. C92.2, “Preferred Voltage Ratings for Alternating Current Electrical\nSystems and Equipment Operating at Voltages Above 230 Kilovolts Nominal.”  It is the prime operating\nvoltage reference and relates the rated short-circuit interrupting current and short-circuit interrupting kA\nor energy handling capabilities.\n5.3.3.1.3  Rated Voltage Range Factor :  Rated voltage range factor, designated as “K,” defines the\nlower limit of operating voltage at which the required symmetrical and asymmetrical current interrupting\ncapabilities vary in inverse proportion to the operating voltage.\n“K” is the ratio of rated maximum voltage to this lower limit of operating voltage.  The rated maximum\nvoltage either divided by K or multiplied by the reciprocal, 1/K will produce the lower limit of operating\nvoltage.  See Table 5-20 for 72.5 kV through 800 kV circuit breakers, where the voltage range factor is\n1.0. This limits the maximum interrupting current capability at voltages lower than rated voltage to a\nvalue no greater than the interrupting current capability at rated maximum voltage."

C37.09-1979, and ANSI/IEEE Std. C37.100-1981.\nThe interrupting ratings are for 60-Hz systems.  Applications on 25-Hz systems should receive special\nconsideration.\nCurrent values have been rounded off to the nearest kiloampere (kA) except that two significant figures\nare used for values below 10 kA.\n(1) The voltage rating is based on ANSI C84.1-1982, where applicable, and is the maximum voltage for\nwhich the breaker is designed and the upper limit for operation.\n(2) The rated voltage range factor, K, is the rat io of rated maximum voltage to the lower limit of the\nrange of operating voltage in which the required symmetrical and asymmetrical current interrupting\ncapabilities vary in inverse proportion to the operating voltage.\n(3) The 25-Hz continuous current rati ngs in amperes are given herewith following the respective 60-Hz\nrating: 600-700; 1200-1400; 2000-2250; 3000-3500.\n(4) Related Required Capabilities.  The following related required capabilities are associated with the\nshort-circuit current rating of the circuit breaker.\n(a) Maximum symmetrical interrupting capability (kA, rms) of the circuit breaker is equal to K times\nrated short-circuit current.\n(b) 3-second short-time current carrying capability (kA, rms) of the circuit breaker is equal to K\ntimes rated short-circuit current.\n(c) Closing and latching capability (kA, rms) of the circuit breaker is equal to 1.6 K times rated\nshort-circuit current.  If expressed in peak amperes, the value is equal to 2.7 K times rated\nshort-circuit current.\n(d) 3-second short- time current carrying capability and closing and latching capability are\nindependent of operating voltage up to and including rated maximum voltage.\n(5) To obtain the required symmetrical current interrupting capability of a circuit breaker at an operating\nvoltage between 1/K times rated maximum voltage and rated maximum voltage, the following\nformula shall be used:\nRequired symmetrical current interrupting capability = rated short-circuit current x (rated maximum voltage)\n(operating voltage)\nFor operating voltages below 1/K times rated maximum voltage, the required symmetrical current\ninterrupting capability of the circuit breaker shall be equal to K times rated short-circuit current.\n(6) With the limitation stated in 5.10 of ANSI/IEEE C37.04-1979, all val ues apply for polyphase and line-\nto-line faults.  For single-phase-to-ground faults, the specific conditions stated in 5.10.2.3 of\nANSI/IEEE C37.04 -1979 apply.\n(7) The ratings in this column are on a 60-Hz basis and are the maximum time interval to be expe cted\nduring a breaker opening operation between the instant of energizing the trip circuit and interruption\nof the main circuit on the primary arcing contacts under certain specified conditions.  The values may\nbe exceeded under certain conditions as specified in 5.7 of ANSI/IEEE Std. C37.04-1979.\n(8) Current values in this column are not to be exceeded even for operating voltages below 1/K times\nrated maximum voltage.  For voltages between rated maximum voltage and 1/K rated maximum\nvoltage, follow (5) above.\n(9) The rated values for T 2 are not standardized for indoor oilless circuit breakers; however, E 2 = 1.88\ntimes rated maximum voltage.\n(10) Rated permissible tripping delay time (Y) = 2 seconds."

At duties below 25 percent of the asymmetrical interrupting capability at rated maximum\nvoltage, the circuit has to be interrupted, but the time required for interruption may be greater than the\nrated interrupting time by as much as 50 percent for 5- and 8-cycle breakers and 1 cycle for 3-cycle\nbreakers.  For breakers equipped with resistors, the interrupting time of the resistor current may be longer.\nThe interrupting time for a close–open operation at a specified duty should not exceed the rated\ninterrupting time by more than 1 cycle for 5- and 8-cycle breakers and one-half cycle for 3-cycle breakers.\nWhen time is expressed in cycles, it should be on a 60-hertz basis.\n5.3.3.4  Rated Permissible Tripping Delay:   The rated permissible tripping delay of a circuit breaker\nis Y seconds and is the maximum value of time for which the circuit breaker is required to carry K times\nrated short-circuit current after closing on this current and before interrupting.  For values, see ANSI\nStd. C37.06.\n5.3.3.5  Other Factors Affecting Rating:   The factors noted above form the basis of rating breakers\ncomplying with ANSI/IEEE Std. C37.04. Other factors that may affect breaker capability include duty\ncycle, transient recovery voltage, reactive component of load, etc.  These are discussed in detail in ANSI/\nIEEE Std. C37.04.\nIn particular, the duty cycle of the circuit breaker has to be considered in its application.  The duty is the\nshort-circuit current required to be interrupted, closed upon, etc.  The cycle is a predetermined sequence\nof closing and opening operations.\nThe standard duty cycle to which circuit breaker ratings are related is one closing plus one opening\noperation, followed by a 15-second waiting period, followed by a second closing and a second opening\noperation (CO + 15 Sec + CO).  This duty cycle permits application of the circuit breaker at 100 percent\nof its rating.  Numerous other operating cycles and time intervals can be used.  If the number of operating\ncycles is greater and/or the time intervals are shorter than the standard duty cycle, derating of the breaker\ninterrupting capability is necessary according to the principles and procedures given in ANSI/IEEE\nStd. C37.04.\n5.3.4  Operating Mechanisms\nThe operating mechanism of a circuit breaker has to be designed to ensure positive or definite opening of\nthe circuit breaker, and circuit interruption has to occur whether the tripping or opening signal is received\nwith the circuit breaker fully closed or in any partially closed position.  The operating mechanism should\nalso be capable of closing, reclosing and latching closed the circuit breaker when applied to the short-\ncircuit current shown in the rating tables (See Tables 5-20, 5-23, and 5-24).\nOperating mechanisms can be provided with or for multiple-pole or independent-pole operation.  The\nterm “operation” is intended to cover tripping (opening), closing, and reclosing of the circuit breaker.\nMost circuit breakers in the United States utilize multiple-pole (three-pole) operation to serve and protect\ntheir entire service area by simultaneous opening or closing of their three poles (phases).\nOperating mechanisms are designed to have the closing function in a ready-to-close condition upon\napplication of a closing signal.  Simultaneous with the closing, the tripping function is placed in a ready-\nto-trip condition by electrical, mechanical, or both electrical and mechanical facilities in the operating\nmechanism.  At the end of the previous closing operation, the closing function is again placed in a ready-\nto-close condition.  This interaction of closing and tripping facilities permits any planned number of\nsequential closing and tripping actions to be performed."

Most circuit breakers use shunt (voltage)\ntrip coils that have to be capable of tripping the circuit breaker when any voltage in the control voltage\nrange is applied, even if the trip coil plunger is away from its normal maximum force position to the\nextent that it is in contact with the actuating trigger of the tripping system.\nOther tripping solenoids include those operated by current from bushing or separate current transformers\nand those operated by a capacitor trip device discharge into the trip coil.  Refer to Table 5-26 for ac and\ndc control, tripping and closing voltages, and voltage ranges.\nThe operating mechanism should incorporate a number of features specifically for maintenance and\nassembly operations.  The mechanism has to have provisions that safeguard maintenance personnel from\nunintended operation.  This is usually accomplished via fuse pullouts, permissive switches, or locking\npins.  Provisions are required for slowly closing the breaker to align the moving contacts.  This is usually\naccomplished with a separate jacking device purchased with the breaker.\nOperating mechanisms should be equipped with operation counters.  Compressors should be equipped\nwith elapsed running time meters.  These two features are important to an effective maintenance program.\n5.3.4.1  Solenoid Operating Mechanisms\n5.3.4.1.1  Voltage (AC and DC)-Operated Solenoids :  Voltage (ac and dc)-operated solenoids were\nused almost entirely on all circuit breakers in the past.  They were effective but relatively slow compared\nto present operating methods.  They also required a large-capacity power supply (transformer or battery)\nbecause of their heavy current (ampere) demand, particularly on large, high-voltage circuit breakers.\nSolenoids are still used on some smaller circuit breakers where their lower operating power requirements\nare within available limits.  Capacitor trip devices can also be provided to operate the solenoid.\n5.3.4.1.2  Current-Operated Solenoids :  Current-operated solenoids supplied with current from\nbushing-type or separate current transformers are available on the smaller circuit breakers and, like the\ncapacitor trip devices, they are very useful in isolated areas where a separate operating power supply\ncannot be justified.\n5.3.4.1.3  Other Types :  All other types of operating mechanisms (except manual) described below use\nsmall control solenoids of ac or dc operation to initiate the major closing operation performed by the\npneumatic, hydraulic, or spring mechanisms.\n5.3.4.2  Motor Operating Mechanisms :  Motor operation of circuit breakers, like solenoids, was used\nmostly in the past on small circuit breakers and is still available from some suppliers.  The motors can be\nac or dc, usually of a high torque and high speed to drive a spring-loaded toggle over dead center and\nrelease to provide good closing speed.\n5.3.4.3  Pneumohydraulic :  Pneumohydraulic is a coined name for a combination of pneumatic and\nhydraulic operating mechanism.

It provides very high speed closing and tripping.\nThis type of mechanism is normally available, from certain suppliers, on 121 kV and higher rated circuit\nbreakers.\n5.3.4.4  Pneumatic :  Pneumatic operating mechanisms utilize compressed high-pressure air (or other\ngas) to apply closing and tripping forces directly to the mechanism.  A variation of pneumatic operation is\npneumatic closing with a tripping spring being compressed during the pneumatic closing operation.  The\npressure varies widely among suppliers from a few hundred to several thousand psi.\nWhere the pneumatic energy storage is integral with the circuit breakers it has to be of sufficient size to\npermit at least two complete closing–opening operations at rated short-circuit current starting at normal\nworking pressure and without replenishing the compressed air energy store.\nWhere the pneumatic energy storage is separate from the circuit breaker, it can be designed to any desired\nsize for any desired combination of operations within the rating structure of the circuit breaker.  It can\nalso be utilized to operate (closing and tripping) several circuit breakers in a similar manner.  It has\nalmost unlimited flexibility for maintenance and emergency piping, valving, backup compressors,\nnitrogen bottles, temporary high-pressure hosing, etc.\nThis type of mechanism is available on most circuit breakers rated 23 kV and higher of the bulk air-blast\nand closed-cycle gas-blast types.\n5.3.4.5  Motor-Charged Spring :  Motor-charged spring operating mechanisms utilize a motor to\ncompress a coil spring that holds this stored energy until a closing signal is received.  Then the spring\nexpands to close the circuit breaker and simultaneously to charge or compress a smaller coil spring, which\nis used to trip the circuit breaker.  This trip spring may or may not be concentric with the closing spring,\ndepending on the individual design.  The energy storage capability of a motor-compressed spring\noperating mechanism has to be sufficient for an opening–closing–opening operation at rated short-circuit\ncurrent, after which the spring-compressing motor should not require more than 10 seconds to compress\nthe closing spring.  Longer times are permissible through agreement between the purchaser and the\nmanufacturer.  In cases where the desired reclosing scheme depends on motor operation, a dc motor may\nbe specified and supplied from a battery or rectifier.\nThe above-described breaker mechanism provides high-speed closing and tripping.  This type of\nmechanism is available on 2.4 kV through 72.5 kV circuit breakers."

Compression of the spring to store the\nclosing energy is accomplished by a hand jack that may be portable or integral with the operating\nmechanism.  Energy storage required consists of only one closing and one tripping operation.\n5.3.4.7  Manual Operating Mechanisms :  Manual operating mechanisms are only available on small\ncircuit breakers.  They utilize a lever-operated toggle mechanism that releases energy from a relatively\nsmall spring.  They may or may not have tripping capability.

C37.20.2, “Standard for Metal-Clad\nand Station-Type Cubicle Switchgear,” Section 2.1.9.3.  Briefly, they are as follows:\n1. The main switching or interrupting device is removable.\n2. Major components of the primary circuit are enclosed and are separated by grounded metal\nbarriers.\n3. All live parts are enclosed within grounded metal compartments with automatic shutters to\nblock off energized parts when devices are disconnected.\n4. The primary bus is covered with insulating material throughout.\n5. There are mechanical interlocks for safety and proper operation.\n6. Secondary devices are essentially isolated from primary elements.\n7. A door to a circuit interrupting device may serve as a control panel or for access to some\nsecondary elements.\n5.4.1.1  Function:   Metal-clad switchgear serves the same system function as comparable elements in\na conventional open bus-type substation.  These elements may include main power switching or\ninterrupting devices, disconnecting switches, buses, instrument and control power transformers, and\ncontrol and auxiliary devices, as well as other devices."

Its application has become\nmore commonplace to house additional equipment including battery, chargers, low-voltage panels, compact \nmicroprocessor relaying, and supervisory control equipment as indicated in Figure 5-9.  The outdoor single\ncontrol house including the switchgear offers a more complete factory-wired and tested assembly.  The\nadvent of the “double-high” breaker configuration in the lower voltage and ampacity cases offers lower costs,\nyet requires specific layouts to avoid joint cubicle-forced maintenance outages.  The cost difference between\nan open substation versus metal-clad switchgear depends on the final installed and operating costs, which will\nvary by application and site.\n5.4.1.2  Applicable National Standards :  The main standards governing metal-clad switchgear are IEEE\nStd. C37.20.2, “IEEE Standard for Metal-Clad and Station-Type Cubicle Switchgear,” NEMA Std. SG-5,\n“Standards for Power Switchgear Assemblies,” and Std. SG-6, “Standards for Power Switching Equipment.”\n The  indoor oilless circuit breakers (predominantly equipped with vacuum interrupters and higher voltage SF 6\ngas interrupting media)  are  as applied with metal-clad switchgear and rated in accordance with ANSI Std.\nC37.06.  Additional applicable standards are listed in Section 5.4.5.\n5.4.2  Types\n5.4.2.1  Configurations :  Metal-clad switchgear is available for both indoor and outdoor installations. The\nbasic switchgear is the same for both types of installations.  For outdoor installations, a weatherproof\nenclosure is provided.  Weatherproof enclosures are made in several arrangements:\n• Single-cubicle lineup, without an enclosed aisle\n• Single line with enclosed aisle\n• Double lineup, with a common enclosed center aisle\nFigure 5-10 is a typical outdoor single-aisle arrangement.  Variations have been made to extend the housing on\neither side of the aisle to use for ancillary equipment and functions.  Manufacturers have adopted trade names\nfor the various arrangements.  Shipping splits can be accommodated to allow standard transportation and also\nto ease field assembly.\nAny decision as to choice of indoor or outdoor type of switchgear should include a cost analysis.  Usually\nweatherproof enclosures will cost less than indoor units (including the cost of a prefabricated or similar type\nof building and the additional labor and ancillary costs).  Other factors, of course, may influence the decision\nsuch as joint use of any building for other purposes.\nMetal- clad  switchgear sections or cubicles are made for every recognized type of switching scheme,\nincluding straight bus (radial circuits), network, sectionalized bus, main and transfer bus, breaker-and-a-half,\nring bus, double bus–double breaker, etc.  The level of reliable bus configuration depends on the number of\nbus sections, redundant feeders, transformer sources, and alternative external local and remote switching\nfeatures.  Sections are made or can be adapted for almost any conceivable arrangement of the equipment\nusually required in circuits for feeders, transformers, generators, motors, reactors, and capacitors.  Entrance\nprovisions can be adapted to accommodate overhead through-roof bushings with insulated cable or bare bus\nbar  circuits and non-segregated metal enclosed bus duct.  Underground entrances are either by insulated\ncable through conduit circuits or wireways.  Sections are made to accommodate all sorts of auxiliary\nequipment such as current and potential transformers, station power transformers, fuses, switches, surge\narresters, etc."

The standard values are shown in Table 5-27:\nTable 5-27:  Rated Insulation Levels of Metal-Clad Switchgear\nRated Nominal Voltage ( rms) 60 Hz, 1 Min Withstand          BIL      \n  4.16 kV 19 kV   60 kV\n  7.2 kV 36 kV   95 kV\n13.8 kV 36 kV   95 kV\n25.0 kV 60 kV  125 kV\n34.5 kV 80 kV 150 kV\nSee IEEE Std.

Standard ratings for a bus and its\nextensions should be matched to the breaker rated value, which can reach a maximum of 48 kA for 13.8 kV\nbus application.\n5.4.3.7  Interrupting or Switching Capability:   Interrupting or switching capability of a particular device\nsuch as a circuit breaker, interrupter switch, fuse, etc., used in a switchgear assembly is determined by the\nrated capabilities of that device as listed in the appropriate standards.\n5.4.4  Purchase Considerations\n5.4.4.1  Procurement:   Metal-clad switchgear assemblies (breaker cells) for a particular job are normally\npurchased as a unit (including the breaker) from a single manufacturer because of the standardization and\nclose coordination required among the various components such as interlocks and connections.  The cells can\nbe joined by either the switchgear breaker manufacturer or an OEM (original equipment manufacturer).  Many\nqualified U.S. suppliers are widely available that can offer local assistance during and after installation.\n5.4.4.2  Specification:   Before undertaking a switchgear project, visit various installation sites and\nmanufacturers’ plants to observe applications and features that would suit the cooperative’s needs. \nSpecifications can be supplied by a consulting engineer or drafted based on use of the manufacturer’s\nguideline specifications.  Any specification for metal-clad switchgear should include the following information\nor requirements.\n5.4.4.2.1   Switching Scheme Selection and One-Line Diagram :   The most common configuration is a single\nbus with a main incoming breaker, a tie breaker, and at least four feeder breakers sized to carry 50  percent of\n normal load.  The tie circuit allows supply from another transformer and external feeder cross ties to allow\nfeeder and main breaker removal for maintenance.  The choice should be made based on system operating\nand reliability requirements and, ultimately, cost.  The one-line diagram (somewhat matching the physical\narrangement desired) should indicate bus configuration, ratings, nomenclature, and ancillary equipment\nincluding auxiliary transformers, instrument transformers, surge arresters, number of conductors per circuit,\nand entry means.\n5.4.4.2.2   Available Fault and Continuous Currents for Breaker Selection :  Anything affecting the circuit\nbreaker requirements should be mentioned such as ultimate source fault capability, parallel transformer\noperation and capacity, normal/emergency feeder loading, reclosing duty, operating voltage, capacitor or\nreactor switching, etc.\n5.4.4.2.3   Main Bus Rating Selection :  The predominant bus material used is copper, since it provides\nstrength and connection advantages over aluminum bus.   Standard ratings match the continuous current\nrating of available circuit breakers.  Judicious arrangements of “source” and “load” breakers can result in the\nlowest bus current requirements.  Future expansion should be considered.  The bus support and conductor\ninsulation system should be track resistant.  The bus insulation should be void free by using either a heat-\nshrink polymer or fluidized bed-applied epoxy.  Indicate the bus configuration, whether 3-wire (with neutral\nexternal to the switchgear) or 4-wire (including either reduced or full-size neutral).  The neutral bus should\nnot be confused with mandatory copper ground bus used to bond switchgear cubicles and housing to the\nstation ground."

The potential transformers are applied in a wye-wye connection with\na resulting 120/208 V secondary connection that is used commonly for metering and relay potentials.  Current\ntransformers are usually single-ratio type with accuracy ranges from C200 to C400 (see Section  5.10.6) for\nmost typical applications.\nCarefully ground instrument transformer circuits.  Separately ground VT primary and secondary circuits to\navoid the tie between the primary and the secondary if the ground is lost.  Ground CTs and VTs at one\nlocation on each circuit.\n5.4.4.2.5   Relay and Control Function Selection :  To ensure that the metal-clad switchgear is wired by the\nmanufacturer as desired and sufficient space is provided for all equipment, it is vital to detail the types of\nrelays, control schemes, interlocks, metering, and interconnection features to be incorporated.  This usually\ninvolves a cubicle-by-cubicle list of materials to be furnished.  It may also include schematic diagrams when\nrequirements are complex.\n5.4.4.2.6   Closing, Tripping, and Power Requirements :  For circuit reliability, usually the switchgear is\nspecified for dc control supply ranging from 48 to 125 volts dc.  This control supply may be segmented by\nmolded case breakers, fuse blocks, or fuse blocks with knife switches in several configurations at the\ncooperative’s choice to provide close, open, and breaker motor-spring charging power.  Auxiliary power may\nbe furnished from a fused transformer within the switchgear lineup or externally from a feeder that is not\naffected by the switchgear outage.  The two most popular auxiliary voltages are 240/120 volts ac, 3-wire,\nsingle-phase, or 120/208 volts ac, 4-wire, three-phase to supply lighting, transformer fan, and LTC control,\nbattery charging, and switchgear environmental control.  The station battery can be supplied with the\nswitchgear to power the switchgear control supply as well as other station higher voltage breakers.\n5.4.4.2.7   Special Requirements of Temperature, Altitude, Unusual Atmospheric Contamination, Vibration,\nEtc.:  Standard conditions are for operation in air at nameplate ratings within –30 °C and +40 °C and at altitudes\nnot exceeding 1000 meters (3300 feet).  If a battery bank is housed within the switchgear, it is mandatory to\nsupply enclosure environmental control by an air conditioner and resistance heating or a heat pump to keep\nthe battery within its best operating range of from +10 °C to +26 °C.  Airborne dust and other contaminants\nmay require additional filters and special paint finishes.  Address these site-specific conditions depending on\noperating experience with other electrical equipment.  In most applications, it is necessary to provide  either\nnon-switched or thermostatically controlled long-life resistance heaters to prevent condensation on the bus\ninsulation and within the breaker during daily and seasonal atmospheric changes.\n5.4.4.2.8   Physical Sketch of Desired Arrangement, Orientation, Mounting Requirements, Indoor or\nOutdoor Type, Etc. :  With a detailed and physically orientated one-line diagram, the manufacturer can usually\nsubmit acceptable arrangements that include cost savings not readily apparent to the cooperative.  Plan,\nelevation, and cross-section sketches help the manufacturer interpret the specifications for any special\narrangements and the inclusion of ancillaries.\n5.4.4.2.9   Itemized List of Requirements :  Clearly state in the Bill of Materials all requirements for equipment\nin each cubicle and include the number of spare breakers and test equipment to be provided, etc. State\ninterface points at incoming bus connections, cable external connectors and insulating material, and enclosure\ngrounding connectors."

Substation regulators are one of the primary means, along with load-tap-changing power\ntransformers, shunt capacitors, and distribution line regulators, for maintaining a proper level of voltage at a\ncustomer’s service entrance.\nA very important function of substation voltage regulation is to correct for supply voltage variation.   With the\nproper use of the control settings and line drop compensation ,  regulators can correct for load variations as\nwell.  A properly applied and controlled voltage regulator not only keeps the voltage at a customer’s service\nentrance within approved limits but also minimizes the range of voltage swing between light and heavy load\nperiods.\nThe substation regulators may be located on individual feeders or in the transformer secondary circuit for\nmain bus regulation.  Normally, the low-voltage substation bus will be regulated rather than the individual\nfeeders.  Individual feeder regulation can usually be justified only when there are extreme variations between\nindividual distribution feeder peak load times.  Very long or heavily loaded distribution feeders may require\nsupplemental regulators strategically located out on the line to maintain voltage levels within required limits."

C84.1, “Voltage Ratings for\nElectric Power Systems and Equipment (60 Hz).”\nRegulators for use on cooperatives’ systems have to meet the requirements in RUS Bulletin 50-90 (S-2),\n“Specification for Substation Regulators,” where applicable.  These specifications apply to step-type\nsingle- or three-phase, substation or pole-mounted, outdoor, oil-immersed, self-cooled regulators.\nIn addition to RUS Bulletin 50-90 (S-2), all regulators should also comply with ANSI Std. C57.15,\n“Requirements, Terminology, and Test Code for Step-Voltage and Induction-Voltage Regulators,” and\nANSI Std. C57.95, “Guide for Loading Oil-Immersed Step-Voltage and Induction-Voltage Regulators.”\n5.5.2  Types\nThere are two general types of voltage regulators, the induction regulator and the step-type regulator.\nBoth types are available in single- or three-phase designs.  The step-type regulator has by far the wider\napplication in the electric distribution system.  The step-voltage regulator has virtually replaced the\ninduction-voltage regulator because it is lower in cost and equally reliable.\n5.5.2.1  Step-Type Voltage Regulator:  A step-voltage regulator is a regulator having one or more\nwindings excited from the system circuit or a separate source and one or more windings connected in\nseries with the system circuit for adjusting the voltage, or the phase relation, or both, in steps, without\ninterrupting the load.  A step-type voltage regulator consists of an autotransformer and a load-tap-\nchanging mechanism built into an integral unit.\nAs with the induction regulator, when a voltage is impressed on the primary winding, the magnetic flux\nlinking the secondary or series winding will induce a voltage in the series winding.\nAn automatic reversing switch is incorporated to obtain an additive or subtractive voltage from the series\nwinding with respect to the primary voltage.  Taps of the series winding are connected to an automatic\ntap-changing mechanism to regulate the amount of voltage change in equal steps.\nThe terminal designations of step-type voltage regulators are as follows:\n• The terminal connected to the load is designated L.\n• The terminal connected to the source is designated S.\n• The common terminal is designated SL.\nFor three-phase regulators, these identifications are Sl, S2, S3, Ll, L2, L3, and S OLO.  This is illustrated in\nFigure 3 of RUS Bulletin 1724D-114 and is also found in ANSI C57.15.\n5.5.2.2  Single-Phase Versus Three-Phase:   Several factors influence the selection.  For substation\nsizes used most frequently by rural electric systems, single-phase regulators (see Figure 5-11) are usually\nless expensive.  They also do a better job of maintaining balanced phase voltages under conditions of\nunbalanced loading.  Single-phase regulators are also more adaptable to line use because of the relative"

Regulation by single-phase regulators also gives maximum reliability for the\nsystem because a regulator can be removed for maintenance or repair without the need to de-energize\ntransformers or other regulators.  Special switches are available to permit removing a regulator from\nservice without interrupting the circuit.  These should always be provided.\nIn large distribution substations, the choice of three-phase regulators (see Figure 5-12) may be based on\ncosts or on the availability of single-phase regulators of the required size.  Three-phase regulators require\nsomewhat less space than three single-phase regulators; however, this is not generally a major factor in\nselection.\nLoad-tap-changing power transformers are becoming more common in distribution substations.  They\nconsist essentially of a three-phase regulator built into a three-phase power transformer.  The relative cost\nof this combination compared to a separate transformer and either three-phase or single-phase regulators\nvaries depending on the size of the substation.\nAside from the base cost of the equipment, the LTC method generally will result in a saving in space,\nbuswork, and supporting structures.  Because their controls sense only one phase of a three-phase circuit\nand since some unbalance may be expected among the phases, the voltage correction of three-phase\nregulators and LTC transformers will be less precise than that of single-phase regulators.\nRegardless of the selection of single-phase or three-phase regulators, a spare regulator for each substation\nis normally not justified.\n5.5.3  Ratings\n5.5.3.1  kVA Rating:   The kVA rating of a single-phase regulator is the product of its rated load\namperes and its rated range of regulation in kilovolts.  For polyphase regulators, this product have to be\nmultiplied by the appropriate phase factors (1.732 for three-phase regulators).  The kVA rating of a\n10 percent, 7620-volt, single-phase regulator capable of carrying a rated load current o f 100 amperes\nwould be:\nkVA = 7.620 x .10 x 100 = 76.2 kVA\nIn those cases where the range of regulation is different for the “raise” position than for the “lower”\nposition, the larger percentage regulation is used to determine the regulator kVA rating.\nThe ratings for regulators generally are based on operation at 60 Hz with a range of regulation of\n10 percent “raise” and 10 percent “lower” without exceeding the specified temperature rise at the given\noperating voltage.  Regulator losses decrease as the regulator moves from the extreme tap positions (boost\nor buck) closer to the neutral point.  Since the range of regulation required need not always be a full\n10 percent, this allows for an extended range of regulator operation.\nFor the range of regulation of single-phase step regulators rated 19.9 kV and below, see Table 5-28.\nFor the range of regulation of three-phase, step-voltage regulators rated 13.8 kV and below, see\nTable  5-29."

These include means for setting or adjusting the voltage level,\nbandwidth, time delay, range of regulation, and line drop compensation.\nSince a change in the setting of any one of these devices will directly affect the operation of one or more\nof the other devices, they are all treated as a unit comprising what is known as the regulator control\nsystem.  In earlier regulators, the components of this control system were electromechanical, but\nregulators manufactured since about 1963 are equipped with static-type devices featuring solid-state or\nmicroprocessor components.  The setting of the individual devices in the newer control systems is based\non the same principles.  They are, in general, easier to set than the older mechanical type.\nThe various devices used in the control system are almost all adjusted at the control panel.  One exception\nis the range of regulation, which is made at the position indicator mounted on the regulator.  The control\npanel can be mounted directly on the regulator or remote from the regulator.\nMicroprocessor controls are available with many different options.  These options include power and\nenergy metering, harmonics analysis, event logging, and communication packages.\nFor a brief description of the control devices and the settings recommended by RUS, see Bulletin 1724D-\n114.\n5.5.4.2  Control System Accuracy:   The individual components utilized in the regulator control\nsystem are accurate devices and, as such, they enable the regulator to obtain a level of efficiency\nsufficient to meet Class I accuracy requirements.  Class I accuracy means that the sum of errors in the"

A plus error would be one causing\nthe regulator output to be higher than the reference value, while a minus error would be one causing the\nregulator output to be lower than the reference value.\nBecause of this accuracy and, more importantly, because of its function in maintaining system voltage\nlevels, the voltmeters and other instruments used in conjunction with regulators should be as accurate as\nthe regulator.  To utilize measuring equipment any less efficient than this deprives the system of the\nregulator’s full capabilities.\n5.5.5  Lightning Protection\nVoltage regulators, like other elements of the distribution system, require protection from lightning and\nother high-voltage surges.  Because voltage regulators are constructed like autotransformers, having one\nof the windings in series with the primary line, additional protection is required for this series winding.\nRegulators are normally factory equipped with bypass arresters across this series winding; these arresters\nmay be connected internally or externally, depending on the manufacturer.  The bypass arrester limits the\nvoltage developed across the series winding during surges to within safe values.\nCAUTION:  Bypass arresters protect only the series winding of the regulator\nand do not eliminate the need for arresters to protect the regulator itself.\n5.5.6  References\nANSI Std.

Shunt capacitor banks alter an electrical system’s\nresponse to disturbances, which can impair system performance.\nSpecific issues that designers should consider include transients caused by bank energization and\npotential resonance conditions.\n5.6.2.2   Switching Transients\n5.6.2.2.1  Bank Energization :  Transient voltages and currents occur whenever shunt capacitor banks\nare energized.   Overvoltages can reach twice the system voltage, with inrush currents ranging from 5 to\n15 times normal steady-state current.  Transient magnitude and duration depend on the natural damping\nprovided by the circuit’s resistive elements.  Transient voltages and current resulting from capacitor\nswitching have to be controlled to avoid exceeding equipment capabilities and damaging customers’\nsensitive electronic equipment.\nANSI/IEEE Std. C37.012, “IEEE Application Guide for Capacitance Current Switching for AC High-\nVoltage Generator Circuit Breakers Rated on a Symmetrical Current Basis,” provides guidelines for\ncalculating transient inrush and discharge currents.  It is important that the design engineer calculate the\npeak magnitude and frequency of these transient currents to compare to the capabilities of the shunt\ncapacitor bank’s equipment and adjoining substation equipment.\n5.6.2.2.1.1  Isolated Bank Switching :  The transient inrush current to a single isolated bank is less than\nthe available short-circuit current at the capacitor location.  Since a circuit breaker has to meet the\nmomentary current requirement of the system, transient inrush current is not a limiting factor for this\napplication.  However, the momentary rating of other switching devices not intended for fault current\ninterruption should be checked.\n5.6.2.2.1.2  Back-to-Back Switching :  Figure 5-13 illustrates a typical arrangement for two capacitor\nbanks switched back to back.  Capacitor banks switched back to back (one being energized when another\nis already connected to the same bus) produce transient currents of high magnitude and high frequency\nthat flow between the banks on closing of the switching device.  The oscillatory current is limited only by\nthe impedance of the capacitor banks and the circuit between them and usually decays to zero in a fraction\nof a cycle of the power frequency.  The component supplied by the power source is usually so small it\nmay be neglected.\nAdditional impedance between capacitor banks may be required in the form of inductors to allow for\nback-to-back switching.  (See Section 5.6.2.2.4.)\n5.6.2.2.1.3  Induced Voltage :  The magnetic fields associated with high inrush current during\nenergization of shunt capacitor banks (isolated bank or back-to-back switching) in either the overhead"

The reason is that the frequency\nof the transient initiated by the primary system capacitor approximates the resonant frequency of the\ncircuit formed by the step-down transformer located in series with secondary system capacitors.\n5.6.2.2.2   Control of Switching Transients :  The magnitude of switching transients caused by capacitor\nbank switching may be greatly reduced by adding current-limiting reactance in series with the bank or\nthrough application of transient control switching devices.\n5.6.2.2.1.1  Transient Control Switching Devices :  Transient-control switching devices limit the\neffects of capacitor switching.  Three common methods are used:\n1. Fitting circuit switchers with pre-insertion inductors\n2. Adding pre-insertion resistors to circuit breakers\n3. Incorporating vacuum switches with synchronous closing control\nThe first two methods momentarily insert an impedance electrically in series with the capacitor bank\nwhen it is energized, dampening transient voltages to acceptable levels.  The third method, synchronous\nclosing, attempts to energize each phase of a three-phase capacitor bank at the instant the applied voltage\ncrosses zero.  This is achieved through synchronous control of the bank’s independent pole vacuum\nswitches.\nTheoretically, “zero-voltage control” eliminates switching transients.  However, experience shows this\ntechnique only lowers switching transients because the switching device’s electrical and mechanical\ntolerances provide only near-zero-voltage closing.\n5.6.2.2.3  Bank De-Energization :  Capacitive switching devices have to be capable of providing\nsufficient dielectric recovery when interrupting capacitive current or the current arc will ignite or\n“restrike.”  A single restrike results in a transient voltage three times system voltage.\nModern capacitor switching devices rarely restrike.  However, use caution to ensure shunt capacitors do\nnot inadvertently de-energize through operation of upline circuit breakers because an underrated circuit\nbreaker could potentially cause restrike.  Voltage transients initiated by restrike have been known to cause\ncatastrophic capacitor bank failures.\n5.6.2.2.4  Current-Limiting Reactance :  It may be necessary to provide inductive reactance in the form\nof current-limiting reactors to limit inrush current during capacitor bank switching.\nSometimes adequate impedance to limit the inrush current to the rating of the switch may be obtained by\nphysically locating the banks as far apart from one another in the substation as possible.  In other cases, it\nmay be necessary to provide inductive reactance in the form of current-limiting reactors between parallel\nswitched capacitor banks.\nTo limit the peak inrush current to “kA” in a substation of “n” equal-size parallel capacitor banks, of"

This will allow the\nmanufacturer to calculate the ratings of any required reactors.

C57.16, “IEEE Standard Requirements,\nTerminology, and Test Code for Dry-Type Air-Core Series-Connected Reactors.”\n5.6.2.3   Resonance:  Resonance occurs whenever an electrical circuit’s inductive and capacitive\nreactances—connected either in parallel or series—are equal at some frequency.  A shunt capacitor bank\nforms a resonant circuit with system inductive elements.  This resonance condition can be excited by\nremote system disturbances such as remote bank switching or sources of harmonic current.  Resonance\ncan cause excessive overvoltages and currents possibly resulting in failure of equipment such as\ncapacitors, surge arresters, instrument transformers, and fuses.\n5.6.2.4   Harmonic Resonance:  Capacitor banks may resonate with harmonic currents produced\nelsewhere on the system.  Harmonic-current flow into the capacitor bank may excite parallel resonance\nbetween the system inductance and bank capacitance.  Parallel resonance causes high oscillating currents\nbetween inductive and capacitive energy-storage elements.  High oscillating currents cause excessive\nvoltage distortion.\nInstalling current-limiting reactors in series with the shunt capacitor bank can “tune” the bank to the\noffending harmonic’s frequency and eliminate parallel resonance.  Essentially, a single-tuned filter is\nformed by the bank’s resistive, inductive, and capacitive elements.  The bank traps harmonic current to\nwhich it is tuned.  Parallel resonance is avoided since harmonic current cannot flow between the system\ninductance and the bank’s capacitance.\nIEEE Std. 519, “IEEE Recommended Practices and Requirements for Harmonic Control in Electrical\nSystems,” suggests acceptable harmonic-current levels industrial users can inject into supplying utility\nsystems and the quality of voltage that the utility should supply.\n5.6.3  Types\nShunt capacitor bank designs include open-rack and metal-enclosed bank designs.  Open-rack substation\ncapacitor banks are used to provide large blocks of kilovars on distribution and transmission systems at\nvoltages up to 765 kV.  Metal-enclosed substation capacitor banks are used to apply medium-size blocks\nof kilovars on distribution systems up to 34.5 kV where a completely enclosed assembly is advantageous\nfor space or safety reasons.\n5.6.3.1   Open-Rack Substation Capacitor Bank:  This type of capacitor bank design mounts capacitor\nunits vertically or horizontally in aluminum or galvanized steel frames.  Ancillary devices including\nswitching equipment, instrument transformers, and surge protection are mounted on separate structures.\nThis type of capacitor bank can be furnished with all phases in a single rack or with only one phase in a\nsingle rack.  The largest standard “upright” rack usually holds 40 capacitor units, and the largest “edge-\nmount” rack usually 32 units.  These racks are generally furnished complete with individual capacitor\nunits, unit fuses, insulators, supporting structure, and other equipment necessary for a complete\ninstallation.\nOpen-rack capacitor banks have many exposed, live components and have to be enclosed with a fence.  A\nkey interlock system can be used to prevent entry into the enclosure until capacitors are properly"

Additionally, adequate electrical clearances have to be provided for exposed live parts\nand external expulsion fuses, which results in a large footprint for most open-rack capacitor banks.\nFor most substation applications in open racks, individual capacitor units are equipped with only one\nbushing.  The second bushing is often unnecessary when the racks themselves form a part of the circuit\nand are insulated by means of base insulators.  In a three-phase delta-connected rack, however, two\nbushing units are required.\nOpen-rack capacitor banks use capacitor units that are protected through external fuses.\n5.6.3.2   Metal-Enclosed Substation Capacitor Bank:  This type of capacitor bank design completely\nencloses the bank’s components within a grounded structure, which eliminates the need for a fenced\nenclosure and mitigates rodent problems.  Enclosed capacitor banks are more aesthetically pleasing\ncompared to open-rack capacitor banks.  The capacitor bank assembly is generally furnished with\ninternally fused capacitor units, insulators, current-limiting reactors, vacuum switches, grounding\nswitches, main line fusing, line disconnect switches, surge arresters, instrument transformers, protection,\nmonitoring and control devices, and a cable entrance section.  The doors of the enclosure are key\ninterlocked to prevent entry into a live compartment.\nEnclosed capacitor banks generally use internally fused capacitor units that are compact in design and\nmore reliable compared to externally fused capacitor units.\nEnclosed capacitor banks can be completely pre-assembled and shipped to a project site.\n5.6.4  Bank Configuration\nA capacitor bank of a given size and voltage rating may be made up of a number of series and parallel\ngroups.  Use of capacitors with the highest possible voltage rating results in a bank design with the fewest\nnumber of series groups, which provides for the most economical design and greatest sensitivity for\nunbalance detection schemes.\nThe maximum and minimum number of capacitor units in parallel per series group is limited by capacitor\nunit design considerations regarding permissible overvoltages and avoidance of case rupture.  It is\nimportant in any capacitor installation to ensure that the maximum operating voltages do not exceed\n110 percent of the rated voltage of any capacitor.  Because of this, the number of parallel capacitor units\nin each series section is selected so that the loss of any one unit in any series section will not result in\nsuch overvoltage.  Additionally, steady-state voltage rises introduced by the flow of harmonic currents\ninto tuned shunt capacitor banks (banks fitted with current-limiting reactors) have to be considered.\nANSI/IEEE Std. C37.99 provides recommendations for the maximum and minimum number of parallel\ncapacitor units per series group.\nWhere only one series section of paralleled capacitors per phase is used and connected either three-phase\ngrounded wye or delta, the unit capacitor fuse is subjected to full system short-circuit available current\nwhen its associated unit fails.  This generally requires that more expensive, high-interrupting-capacity,\ncurrent-limiting fuses be applied in situations where available fault currents exceed 4 kA.  One advantage\nis that these banks can be designed in very small sizes without encountering unacceptable overvoltages on\nthe remaining capacitors in a phase when one or more capacitors in that phase fails and clears, which"

For open-rack designs, the racks themselves do not have to be insulated\nfrom ground, thus saving the cost of base insulators.\nWhen a three-phase wye connection is used with only one series section of paralleled units per phase, it is\nadvantageous from a fusing standpoint to leave the neutral floating.  This allows the unfaulted phases to\nlimit the fault current supplied to the faulted phase.  The fuse on the faulted unit will “see” a maximum of\nonly three times normal bank phase current.  While this may still be considerable current for large\nequipment, it is far less than usually available from the system, and a much less expensive, low-\ninterrupting-capacity fuse can be applied.  A (low) calculated risk is taken of simultaneous failure of units\nin different phases.  It should be noted that, in a floating wye connection, the neutral has to have full line\ninsulation between it and ground as well as sufficient ground clearances.\nA double-wye configuration is often used where large amounts of kVAR are desired and the equipment is\nto be equipped with low-interrupting-capacity expulsion fuses.  Designing this bank with connected\nmultiple series groups limits the maximum fault current so that individual current-limiting capacitor fuses\nare not usually required unless the parallel kVAR exceeds 4,650 kVAR, in accordance with ANSI/IEEE\nStd. C37.99.  Double-wye banks with only single series groups do not limit the maximum fault current.\nTherefore, individual capacitor fuses have to be capable of interrupting the system available fault current.\nFigure 5-14 illustrates a typical Y-Y connected capacitor bank with one series section per phase and\nneutrals isolated.\nDelta-connected capacitor banks are generally applied only on lower voltage (23 kV or below) systems\nwhere the system voltage equals the voltage rating of a unit capacitor.  They have to also be properly\ninsulated from ground.  Additionally, where one series group per phase is used, individual capacitor unit\nfuses should be capable of interrupting the system short-circuit phase-to-phase fault current.  This usually\nrequires the use of current-limiting fuses.\n5.6.5  Ratings\n5.6.5.1  Circuit Voltage:  Domestic manufacturers can supply individual capacitor units in voltages\nranging from 2.4 to 25 kV.  Units of the same or of different voltage ratings can be mixed to obtain the\nrequired circuit voltage.  Most cooperatives utilize capacitor equipment at or above 7.2 kV.\nThe desired circuit voltage is obtained by connecting as many capacitor groups in series as necessary to\nobtain the required voltage.  Usually, the best engineering choice is to use the fewest number of series\ngroups as possible.  Use of capacitors with the highest possible voltage rating results in fewer series\ngroups.  This generally provides the simplest and most economical bank design.  However, inventory or\nother economic considerations may override this rule.\n5.6.5.2   kVAR Rating:   Capacitor unit ratings available from domestic manufacturers undergo frequent\nchange in order to provide the most practical and economical sizes for existing conditions.  In general, the\ntrend is toward larger unit sizes.  Standard capacitor units for shunt capacitor bank applications are 50,\n100, 150, 200, 300, and 400 kVAR.  No upper limits are defined for internally fused capacitor units.\nThese units are typically sized based on minimizing the number of capacitor units to minimize the bank’s\nphysical size while avoiding overvoltage and unbalance conditions with a substantial loss of a capacitor\nunit’s individually fused elements."

All capacitor switching devices should be applied\nwithin their maximum voltage, frequency, and current ratings, including transient inrush current and\nfrequency.\nThe switching device should have a voltage rating at least equal to 10 percent above rated capacitor\nvoltage since capacitors can be continuously operated at this voltage.\nSelect the switching device’s continuous current rating based on consideration of factors that increase\ncurrent flow in the capacitor bank.  Multiplying factors are generally applied to include the effects of\novervoltage (1.10), capacitor tolerance (1.05 to 1.15), and harmonic component (1.05 for ungrounded\ncapacitor banks: 1.10 for grounded capacitor banks).  It is usually considered adequate to use a total\nmultiplier of 1.25 for ungrounded operation and 1.35 for grounded operation. (See ANSI/IEEE\nStd. C37.99.)\nIt is important to understand that most switching devices are derated for capacitor switching.  A switching\ndevice’s rated capacitance switching capability is usually well below the device’s continuous current\nrating.\nIt is important to select a switching device designed for the application’s specific duty to avoid\npotentially damaging overvoltages."

A variety of options is\navailable in terms of price, features, and quality.  These range from high-priced panel-mounted to low-\npriced socket-mounted controls.  In recent years, capacitor controls based on electromechanical relays\nhave been superseded by more modern electronic types including solid-state and microprocessor-based\ncontrollers.  See Figures 5-15 through 5-18 for typical schematics of various capacitor control\narrangements.\nControl and application of capacitors are such closely related subjects that a discussion of one has to\nnecessarily involve the other.  In fact, in the typical situation, both the type of control and its adjustment\nare dictated by the objectives of the capacitor installation.\nCapacitor switching controls provide outputs that are basically single-pole, double-throw switches\nactivated by control signal(s) selected to reflect kVAR requirements.  Theoretically, at least, any\nintelligence that changes only when a change in the kVAR supply is needed can be utilized to switch\ncapacitors automatically.  In practice, however, selecting a signal that accurately reflects the requirements\nof the system often turns out to be the most difficult part of the problem.  The single-input types, such as\nvoltage and time controls, are generally less expensive in initial cost and installation, less complex, and\neasier to adjust but less flexible in application than the dual-input types such as kilovar and current-biased\nvoltage controls.\nThe selection of a control for a particular switched capacitor bank requires careful evaluation of several\nrelated factors.  Some of the more important considerations are listed below.  No attempt has been made\nto list them in any particular order, since their relative importance and probably even the factors\nthemselves will vary considerably from one system to another.\n• Purpose —The purpose of the bank affects selection of the appropriate controller.  The purpose\nmay be to reduce losses, improve voltage under normal or emergency operating conditions,\nreduce thermal loading of lines and equipment, etc.\n• Location —The location of the bank affects what control parameter best represents changes in\nkVAR requirements.  The bank’s location influences whether voltage will drop appreciably as\nload increases, whether direction of feed is likely to change frequently because of normal or\nemergency circuit rearrangements, etc.\n• Coordination —Coordination with related supplementary voltage regulation equipment\nincluding switched capacitors and voltage regulators affects the type of control strategy to be\nimplemented."

This should be determined by examining the daily load curves.  The time\ncontrol does not require the monitoring of any electrical quantities.\nModern time clock controllers are microprocessor based, which provides 24-hour, 7-day programmable\ncontrol.  These devices typically use lithium batteries for backup during power outages.\n5.6.6.2.3  Temperature Controls :  In certain areas of the country, the reactive load is more closely\naligned with temperature variation than with anything else.  Such loads do not exhibit the periodicity that\nwould suggest the use of time clocks.  They are often associated with the operation of air conditioners.  A\ntemperature control can be used to apply shunt capacitors with increases or decreases in ambient\ntemperature.  The temperature controller’s thermostat responds to changes in ambient temperature to\nprovide input to the switching device.  A determination of the relationship between kVAR load and air\ntemperature is required to be able to set the temperature controller.  As with time controls, these devices\nare relatively economical and do not require the monitoring of electrical quantities.\n5.6.6.2.4  Voltage Controls :  The most straightforward and simplest of the controls that respond to\nchanges in electrical conditions is the voltage control.\nThe voltage found at a point on an electrical system is the summation of all conditions on the system.\nCapacitors increase the voltage at the point where they are applied.  Thus, a low voltage would suggest\nthe need for capacitors, and a high voltage would call for their removal.  This would not be true at a\nlocation close to the output of a compensated regulator where high voltage is developed with peak loads.\nA simple capacitor control based only on voltage would not give the desired results if applied in a\nsegment of the system where compensation in regulators cancelled the significance of high and low\nvoltage as an indicator of loads.  The bandwidth of the control should be larger than the voltage change\ncaused by switching of the capacitor bank to prevent “hunting.”  Hunting refers to unintentional cycling\nof capacitor banks “on” and “off” due to incorrect settings on capacitor controllers.\nVoltage controls usually respond to signals from a nominal 120-volt source ranging between 108 and\n132 volts.  If the switching device is a vacuum switch, the primary of the VT monitoring voltage should\nbe protected by means of a distribution class surge arrester.  This protects against high voltages produced\nby the chopping effect of the switches.\n5.6.6.2.5  Current Controls :  A simple answer to many of the desired objectives of capacitor control is\nthe measurement and subsequent switching of the capacitors according to the flow of current.  This type\nof controller is suitable where voltage is well regulated and the power factor of the load remains constant\nwith variation in kilowatt loading, or if the power factor of the circuit varies predictably with variation in\nkilowatt loading.\nThis solution is particularly attractive on circuits consisting primarily of a known group of electric\nmotors.  Typical examples would be a circuit for pumps on a major water supply or for irrigation, driven\nby electric motors and located a considerable distance from the source, or on any application where there\nis a dependent relationship of reactive (kVAR) load with current.\nHeavy loads on circuits of this type could occur at any time of day or night and any day of the week.\nCapacitors used on this application would be dedicated to serving these motor loads.  Switching of the\ncapacitors is, therefore, logically a function of these loads."

As a\nsafety feature to protect against high secondary open-circuit voltages, the control should be arranged to\nshort circuit the CT secondary leads automatically when the control circuit is opened.\nIn some instances several banks of capacitors are placed in the same substation to facilitate incremental\napplication of kVAR to the bus.  There might be, for example, a fixed capacitor bank and two switched\nbanks controlled by a two-step voltage controller.  In addition to setting multi-step controls to avoid\n“hunting,” the capacitor switches should be selected with the aim of protecting them from the\nconsequences of back-to-back capacitor switching.\n5.6.6.2.6  VAR Controls :  The most sophisticated control method, the VAR control, responds directly\nto VAR demand.  This type of controller is suitable where voltage is regulated and power factor varies\nunpredictably with variation in kilowatt loading.\nCare has to be taken to set the control so that the response of the system to the presence or absence of the\ncapacitor bank is less than the bandwidth represented by the maximums and minimums of the settings on\nthe control.  For example, if a 2100 kVAR bank of capacitors is applied, the “turn off” setting of the\ncontrol should be greater than the “turn on” setting +2100 kVAR.  This is necessary to prevent “hunting.”\nVAR controls are usually arranged to respond to signals from a VT with a secondary rating of 120 volts\nconnected across two phases and a CT with a secondary rating of 5 amperes in the third phase.  This\narrangement provides a 90-degree phase angle between the voltage and the current signals at unity power\nfactor.\nSome VAR controls have capacitors in either the voltage or current inputs to retard the phase angle and\nthus make it possible to read VAR signals by monitoring fewer than three phases.\nIn addition to the above controls, there are a number of combination types, of which the most common are\ntime and temperature, and voltage with current bias.\nModern capacitor controllers allow implementation of one or more of the above control functions to meet\neach project’s unique requirements.  The following functions are commonly used:\n• Time and temperature\n• Voltage with current bias\n• Voltage with time bias\n5.6.6.2.7  Protective Controls :  Capacitor switching devices are also arranged to operate in response to\nsignals from protective controls.  These are described further under Section 5.6.7, “Protection.”\n5.6.6.3   Control Power\n5.6.6.3.1  Wiring :  Instruct the capacitor bank’s manufacturer to provide a common junction box to\nfacilitate field connections for all secondary circuits.\n5.6.6.3.2  Source :  Most controls with lockout relays require nominal 120 volts ac for operation, but\nthey can be arranged for other voltages.  The switches that are controlled, however, may be ac or dc at\nany number of voltages.  Tell the capacitor bank’s manufacturer the control voltages available at the\ninstallation."

If the “automatic–manual” switch is set for “automatic,” the capacitor\nswitching device will respond to automatic control signals from the bank’s controller unless a protective\noverride opens the device and locks it out.\n5.6.7   Protection\nAdditional information on capacitor bank protection can be found in RUS Bulletin 1724D-112.\n5.6.7.1  Fuses:   Electric devices (or circuits) are generally fused for one or both of two basic reasons:\n1. To protect the device from overloads\n2. To protect the system from failure within the device\nIn some cases, such as group fusing with cutouts, the fuse may be used as a manual disconnect or\nswitching means.  This is not, however, a basic function of a capacitor fuse.  Because capacitors, for\neconomic reasons, are designed for operation at high dielectric stress, a certain calculated failure rate is to\nbe expected.  Thus, capacitor unit fuses are used primarily to protect the electrical system from dielectric\nfailures that are expected to occur.\nConventional capacitor units are typically protected by an external fuse connected in series with each\ncapacitor unit.  Internally fused units are available that eliminate the need for external fuses.  Internally\nfused capacitor units utilize fuse links connected in series with each of the unit’s capacitor elements.  An\ninternally fused capacitor unit comprises a large number of capacitor elements connected in parallel with\nonly a few groups of parallel elements connected in series.\nFigure 5-19 illustrates capacitor units utilizing external and internally fused capacitor elements.\nIn general, capacitor banks utilizing internally fused capacitor units are configured with fewer capacitor\nunits in parallel and more series groups compared to banks configured with external fuses.\nRecent advances in capacitor bank design include the application of fuseless capacitor banks.  This design\nutilizes capacitor units manufactured from polypropylene film.  This technology provides a highly reliable\ndesign, virtually eliminating the need for fuses in many applications.  These capacitor banks are simpler\nand more economical to build and operate compared to fused banks.  The fuseless design has been mainly\napplied at voltages ranging from 69 kV to 230 kV.\n5.6.7.1.1  Functional Requirements of Capacitor Fuses :  Capacitor fuses have to accomplish the\nfollowing principal functional requirements:\n1. Isolate a faulted capacitor unit, bank, or portion of a bank from the circuit to which it is\nconnected with negligible disturbance to the remainder of the bank or system.\n2. Prevent case rupture by clearing the faulted capacitor from the circuit before the gas generated\nby the internal fault bursts the capacitor case, possibly damaging adjacent units or equipment,\ninjuring personnel, or discharging dielectric liquid into the ecosystem.\n3. Indicate the location of the failed capacitor (externally fused units only)."

Group fuses have to also be capable of interrupting the\nexpected 60 Hz fault current.  This type of fusing is not often used on substation capacitor banks."

    "content": "Bulletin 1724E-300\nPage 282\nGroup fusing of capacitor banks may be advantageous for relatively small ungrounded-wye capacitor\nbanks where operation of a group fuse isolates an entire phase without detrimental effect on the system.\nElimination of the unit fuses permits more compact rack designs and simpler buswork.\nHowever, care should be taken in the application of group fuses to be sure that fault current through the\nfuse will cause it to operate and clear before the combined system fault current and current discharge\nfrom adjacent capacitors into the faulted unit can cause case rupture.  By providing adequate coordination\nbetween the fuses’ “maximum total clearing” curve and the capacitor’s case rupture curve, case rupture\ncan be avoided.\n5.6.7.1.2.2  Individual Fusing :  In a capacitor bank or equipment having a number of units connected\nin parallel, each capacitor unit will usually have its own fuse.  The series combination of each capacitor\nunit and fuse will be in parallel with other capacitors.  Often, for multiphase arrangements and various\nseries parallel groupings, backup bus fault protection is also provided by either circuit breakers or large\npower fuses.\nWith individual fusing, the loss of any individual capacitor does not necessarily result in the loss of the\nbank, the phase, or even the series section.  Adjacent units discharge into the faulted unit and its fuse,\nallowing the fuse to quickly clear the fault.\nFinally, if for any reason a reduction needs to be made in the kVAR of the bank, this can be accomplished\neasily by simply removing the appropriate fuses or links.  The spare rack spaces then serve as a storage\nshelf for the extra capacitors.\n5.6.7.1.3  Effect of Connections on Capacitor Fuses :  The requirements for individual capacitor fuses\nare affected by the capacitor bank connections as well as the system to which the bank is connected.\nNon-current-limiting fuses, which are cheaper than the current-limiting type, can be used wherever bank\nconnections can be arranged to limit the available fault current.  Possible capacitor bank connections are\nthe following:\n5.6.7.1.3.1  Three-Phase Grounded Wye and Delta :  Where only one series section of paralleled units\nper phase is used, and the equipment is connected three-phase grounded wye or delta, the unit fuse is\nsubjected to the full available system short circuit whenever a capacitor unit fails.  High-interrupting-\ncapacity, current-limiting fuses are required in these situations when the fault current is on the order of\n4000 amperes or higher.\n5.6.7.1.3.2  Ungrounded Wye :  When a three-phase wye connection is used with only one series\nsection of paralleled units per phase and the neutral is left floating, the unfaulted phases will limit the\ncurrent supplied to the faulted phase from the system.  The fuse on the faulted unit will see a maximum of\nonly three times normal bank phase current, and generally a less expensive low-interrupting-capacity fuse\ncan be used.  The small risk of simultaneous failure occurring in units of different phases that would\nresult in a phase-to-phase fault is usually accepted.\nThe above applies to capacitor banks where single-bushing capacitor units have been mounted on\ninsulated racks.  However, capacitor units should be capable of interrupting system phase-to-ground fault\ncurrent where two-bushing capacitor units are mounted on grounded racks.  If lower rated fuses are used,\nfault clearing might not be accomplished by the fuse, which will require the bank’s overcurrent relaying\nto operate a switching device capable of interrupting the fault current."

    "content": "Bulletin 1724E-300\nPage 283\n5.6.7.1.3.3  Series – Parallel :  Series-connected groups of paralleled capacitor units can provide an\neffective means of limiting fault current to a level where less expensive non-current-limiting fuses can be\nused.  This applies to installations where the parallel kVAR of individual groups does not exceed\n4,650  kVAR.\nThe bank voltage rating is the principal factor that determines what series-parallel arrangement to use,\nalong with the type of equipment.  Multiple series section arrangements are not practical in equipment\nbelow 15 kV and in housed equipment.  Consult the capacitor manufacturer regarding fusing for a given\nbank arrangement and specified maximum fault current.\n5.6.7.2   Protective Controls:  The purpose of a capacitor bank’s protective control is to remove the\nbank from the bus before any units are exposed to more than 110 percent of their voltage rating.  When\ncapacitor units in a capacitor bank fail, the amount of increase in voltage across the remaining units\ndepends on the connection of the bank, the number of series groups of capacitors per phase, the number of\nunits in each series group, and the number of units removed from one series group.  Protective controls\nare available for grounded neutral capacitor banks, ungrounded neutral capacitor banks, and capacitor\nbanks connected wye-wye.\nWhere the capacitor bank is switched by a circuit breaker, the protective control does not need a lockout\nrelay since breakers are usually equipped internally with lockout functions.  However, where other\nswitching means are provided, the protective control should have a lockout with a manual reset function.\n5.6.7.2.1  Grounded Neutral :  The most straightforward protective control for grounded neutral\ncapacitor banks is the neutral relaying control.  This scheme operates on the neutral current generated\nbecause of the unbalance caused by capacitor failures in any phase.\nThe major advantage of the neutral protection scheme is that it is relatively inexpensive.  If there aren’t\ntoo many series sections, this control can be set to alarm and trip at two different levels of neutral current\nto provide early detection that a problem exists in the bank and adequate protection should additional\ncapacitor units fail.  It is important to be aware of this protective control’s disadvantages.  Third-order\nharmonics have to be blocked out of the control, since they will flow in the neutral regardless of whether\nor not the bank is unbalanced.  This blocking is often accomplished by means of a small capacitor in the\ncontrol that tunes the sensitive element to 60 Hz.\nIt is noted that this control is not sensitive to overvoltages caused by the loss of equal number of capacitor\nunits in one or more groups in each phase.  However, this is usually not a significant limitation.  It may be\ntoo sensitive and turn off the bank on unit failures occurring in different series sections of the same phase,\neven though no series group experiences greater than 110 percent overvoltage.  Finally, since the\nassociated CT has to be large enough to handle continuously the third-order harmonics (usually assumed\nto be 10 percent per phase of fundamental phase current, if no better information is available), the signal\nat the CT secondary may be too small for relays of ordinary sensitivity.  This can be overcome by using\nthree CTs, one in each phase, and connecting the secondaries in parallel and relaying for the zero\nsequence current.\nThis protective scheme responds only to capacitor overvoltages caused by unbalance and does not protect\nagainst capacitor overvoltage due to changes in three-phase supply voltage.\n5.6.7.2.2  Ungrounded Neutral :  The floating-neutral protective control is similar to that for the\ngrounded neutral bank, except that a VT is used in the neutral (usually rated 15 kV) to indicate neutral"

The control is voltage sensitive and subject to the same limitations and\nadvantages as the protective control for grounded neutral capacitor banks.\n5.6.7.2.3  Wye-Wye :  The wye-wye capacitor bank may be protected by means of a CT between the\ntwo ungrounded neutrals.  Care should be taken to avoid exceeding individual capacitor unit fuses’\ninterrupting ratings when applying wye-wye banks having one series group per phase.  Dependent on the\nnumber of capacitors in each phase, there may be sufficient discharge current from parallel capacitor units\ninto the faulted unit to exceed its fuses’ interrupting rating.  The impedance of the neutral CT is\nnegligible; however, it cannot limit discharge currents into the faulted unit.  This scheme tends to be fairly\nsensitive, and the CT does not require gap protection, even if a vacuum switch is used.  The buswork,\nhowever, can be difficult to design.\n5.6.7.3   Protection of Current and Voltage Transformers Installed in Capacitor Banks\n5.6.7.3.1  Current Transformers :  Switching of capacitors produces transient currents that can produce\novervoltages on secondary circuits.  Overvoltage protection is required to prevent damage to the current\ntransformer winding and connected burdens.  Secondary protection generally involves the correct\napplication of a high-current-rated varistor or spark gap connected directly across the current transformer\nterminals.  Varistors applied to secondary windings should be selected with sufficient energy-absorbing\ncapability to withstand secondary oscillations.  Additionally, current transformers that have wound\nprimary windings require overvoltage protection by adding an arc gap or arrester across the primary.\n5.6.7.3.2  Voltage Transformers, Capacitor-Coupled Voltage Transformers, and Resistance Potential\nDevices :  AC voltage sources of various types are used in capacitor bank applications for control and\nprotection schemes.  Overvoltage protection of these devices is normally required since transients or\nsurges produced during switching can overstress primary-to-secondary insulation and secondary-to-\nground insulation.  Surge arresters are typically used for primary protection.  Varistors or spark gaps are\ntypically used for secondary protection.\nAC voltage sources should be specified for full line voltage with primary overvoltage protection added to\nprovide additional protection.\n5.6.7.4   Bus Insulation Systems:  Unlike enclosed capacitor banks, open-rack capacitor banks have\nexposed live parts.  In some cases, this exposure has resulted in bank outages due to isolation of faults\noriginated by birds or animals bridging live parts or live parts to ground.  One straightforward prevention\nof this is to use edge-mounted equipment, since the electrical clearances in the racks used in this\nequipment are sufficiently liberal and make it highly unlikely that any bird or animal will be large enough\nto bridge any of the live parts.\nHowever, if upright racks are used and birdproofing is deemed necessary, bus bar insulation systems are\ncommercially available that can be used to protect against accidental bridging of conductors commonly\ncaused by birds and animals.  Heat shrinkable tubes, tapes, and sheets and molded fittings allow for\nsimple installation and flexibility to cover most conductor shapes and sizes.  Although enclosed capacitor\nbanks have very little exposure to faults by rodents, bus bar insulation systems are sometimes applied in\nareas where animals such as snakes and lizards are prevalent.  For a description of these protective\ndevices, see CRN’s Animal-Caused Outages  (Project 94-5).\nCapacitor bank manufacturers can apply bus insulation at the factory, or it can be applied in the field."

CP-1, substation capacitor units are built with internal discharge resistors\nso that the residual voltage is reduced to 50 volts or less within 5 minutes after the capacitor unit has been\ndisconnected from its source of supply.\nManually operated switches should be provided to short-circuit and ground each series section of the\ncapacitor bank after it has been disconnected from the circuit but before it is handled by personnel to\navoid potentially exposing personnel to hazardous voltages at capacitor terminals.\nThe duty on these switches is not severe, and most bank manufacturers can supply single hook-stick-\noperated switches for open-rack bank designs and gang-operated switches for enclosed capacitor bank\ndesigns to perform both the shorting and grounding functions.  While not always required, it may be\ndesirable to specify interlock schemes to prevent the operation of shorting and grounding switches on live\ncircuits and to keep personnel from access to capacitor bank live components when the banks have not\nbeen shorted and grounded.\n5.6.9  Mounting\nThere are two common positions for mounting capacitor units in outdoor substation racks: upright and\nedge mount.  These mounting configurations are illustrated in Figures 5-20 and 5-21.\n5.6.9.1   Open Rack Design:  The upright mounting position is generally preferred for capacitor units up\nto 10 kV and edge mount for units above 10 kV.  Upright racks are relatively compact and provide a\nmetal framework on the outside, which tends to protect the capacitor units.  Edge-mount units provide\nample clearances and protection from bus and bushing flashovers caused by birds, rodents, and other\ncauses.  They do, however, require more physical ground space.\nIn the United States, power capacitors are mounted by means of two flanges spaced 39.7 cm (15-5/8 in.)\napart.\nWhere units are protected by means of expulsion fuses, it is necessary to provide a minimum of 3 feet of\nair clearance plus strike distance between the ends of the fuses and any grounded metal objects to prevent\ninadvertent flashovers on fuse operation caused by ionized gases contacting the metal objects.  For non-\nexpulsion fuses, the additional 3 feet of clearance is unnecessary.\nNormally, capacitor equipment and its substructures are designed to withstand minor earthquake"

There should be unrestricted air circulation around the units.  If ambient conditions\nare extremely dusty, smoky, or salty, consult the capacitor manufacturer as to the advisability of extra\ncreep bushings and insulators and more generous strike clearances between live parts."

Reproduced with\npermission of the National Electrical Manufacturers Association.\nCapacitor equipment is often mounted on 2.44-meter (8-foot) substructures to provide adequate ground\nclearance, personnel safety, ventilation, and a place to mount accessories.  This clearance should be\ncarefully checked and increased if necessary to meet applicable safety codes.\n5.6.9.2   Enclosed Bank Design:  Manufacturers of enclosed capacitor banks custom design each bank\nfor its unique application.  Efforts are made by the manufacturer to provide a compact design.  The\noverall size of the enclosure depends on the number of installed components and orientation and\nmounting of these components.  The designer may mount individual capacitor units horizontally or\nvertically to reduce the overall size of the bank.\nNon-expulsion, capacitor-rated, current-limiting fuses are used rather than expulsion type to fuse\nexternally fused capacitor units.  Expulsion fuses are not to be used since they do not support a compact\nbank design.  These fuses require clearances for fuse expulsion in addition to electrical clearances.\nInternally fused capacitor units are often used since no external fuses are required and they allow for a\nmore compact design."

It is\nrecommended that the manufacturer be consulted on forces that exceed those given in the table.\nThese higher forces may be due to long bus spans rigidly connected to switches, extra high short\ncircuit current forces, bus spans other than aluminum tube conductors, and other forces not\nconsidered.(2) These loadings were derived for the mechanical operations requirement of IEEE C37.34, Clause\n11 and do not necessarily represent the mechanical loading limit on terminals.  Consult the\nmanufacturer when actual valves are needed.(3) At 242 kV and above, F 4 forces may be reduced by 40% for switches with hinged or pivoting-type\nterminal pads."

Although the surge arrester is an essential\ncomponent in insulation coordination, a complete description of the total concept of insulation\ncoordination is beyond the scope of this bulletin.\nSurge arresters are the basic protective devices against system transient overvoltages that may cause\nflashovers and serious damage to equipment.  They establish a baseline of transient overvoltage above\nwhich the arrester will operate to protect the equipment.  When a transient overvoltage appears at an\narrester location, the arrester conducts internally and discharges the surge energy to ground.  Once the\novervoltage is reduced sufficiently, the arrester seals off, or stops conducting, the flow of power follow\ncurrent through itself and the circuit is returned to normal.  As voltage-sensitive devices, arresters have to\nbe carefully selected to correlate properly with the system operating voltages."

Classifications are\ndetermined by prescribed test requirements.  Primary differences in the use of the classes involve the\nvoltage levels the arresters will withstand and protect and the current levels the arresters will discharge.\nAll three classes may be used in substation applications.\nTest requirements for gapped silicon-carbide arresters are listed in IEEE Std. C62.1.  Table 5-52\nindicates the voltage ratings for surge arresters.  Table 5-53 indicates the pressure-relief test currents\nfor the station- and intermediate-class arresters.  The application of gapped silicon-carbide surge\narresters is described in ANSI Std. C62.2.  The major protective characteristics of the gapped silicon-\ncarbide arresters are summarized in Tables 5-54, 5-55, and 5-56."

The appropriate arrester has to be determined\nfrom an analysis of the protective characteristics required, the importance of the equipment protected, the\nlevel of reliability desired, and the overall cost of protection.\nRefer to RUS IP 202-1 for a listing of surge arresters that may be used in the cooperative’s substations.\n5.8.2.1  Station Class Arresters:   Station-class arresters are more ruggedly constructed than those in\neither the intermediate or distribution class.  They have greater surge current discharge ability and lower\nIR voltage drop, thus affording better protection.  In the event of arrester failure, their ability to vent\nsafely during high system short-circuit currents is better than the other classes of arresters.\nStation-class arresters are recommended for all substations of large capacity (10,000 kVA and above) and\non smaller substations that are of prime importance.  They should be applied on transmission circuits\nlonger than approximately 100 miles or where shunt capacitor banks are installed.\nStation-class arresters are also desirable on substations using reduced insulation (BIL) or those located in\nhigh lightning exposure areas.  They should be used where the system short-circuit current exceeds the\nventing capability of intermediate-class arresters.  They are the only class of arrester available for use on\nsystems above 150 kV.\n5.8.2.2  Intermediate Class Arresters:   Intermediate-class arresters may be used in substations rated\nbelow 10,000 kVA at a cost saving when compared to station-class arresters.  Their electrical protective\ncharacteristics (sparkover and IR) are higher than station-class arresters, but are usually adequate for\nsmall substations.  In the event of arrester failure, intermediate-class arresters can safely vent with short-\ncircuit current of 16,000 amperes or less.  Intermediate-class arresters are available in ratings 3 kV\nthrough 120 kV.\n5.8.2.3  Distribution-Class Arresters:   Distribution-class arresters may be used on the low-voltage\nside of distribution substations.  Install them on the load side of feeder overcurrent protective devices\n(reclosers or breakers).  They are frequently applied connected to the low-voltage bushings of small\ndistribution substation transformers.  Their protective characteristics are not as good as either\nintermediate- or station-class arresters.  If distribution-class arresters are used in substations, use only the\ndirect-connected type with ground lead disconnector (isolator).\n5.8.3  Ratings (Standard Definitions)\n5.8.3.1  Voltage Rating–Duty Cycle (kV rms):   The designated maximum permissible operating\nvoltage between its terminals at which an arrester is designed to perform its duty cycle.  It is the voltage\nrating specified on the nameplate.  This rating is applicable specifically to the silicon-carbide valve\narrester and is also typically listed with the MCOV rating for the metal oxide arrester.\n5.8.3.2  Power-Frequency Sparkover Voltage:   The root-mean-square value of the lowest power\nfrequency sinusoidal voltage that will cause sparkover when applied across the terminals of an arrester.\nThis rating is applicable to the silicon-carbide valve arrester.\n5.8.3.3  Impulse Sparkover Voltage:   The highest value of voltage attained by an impulse of a\ndesignated wave shape and polarity applied across the terminals of an arrester prior to the flow of\ndischarge current.  This rating is applicable to the silicon-carbide valve arrester."

When applying metal oxide surge arresters, the minimum value of this voltage\nis usually the maximum system line-to-ground voltage.\n5.8.3.5  Discharge Current:   The discharge current is the current that flows through an arrester as a\nresult of a surge.\n5.8.3.6  Discharge Voltage:   The voltage that appears across the terminals of an arrester during the\npassage of discharge current.  Maximum values are usually available from the manufacturer for currents\nof 1.5, 3, 5, 10, 20, and 40 kA with a wave shape of 8 x 20 µs.  The discharge voltage resulting from a\nstandard 8 x 20 µs current wave shape approximates the standard 1.2 x 50 µs voltage wave shape\nreasonably well between the current magnitudes of 5 kA and 20 kA.\nThe 8 x 20 µs standard current wave shape is one that rises to crest in 8 µs and decays to one-half crest\nvalue in 20 µs.  The 1.2 x 50 µs voltage wave shape is one that rises to crest in 1.2 µs and decays to one-\nhalf crest value in 50 µs.\n5.8.3.7  Discharge-Voltage Current Characteristic:  The discharge-voltage current characteristic is\nthe variation of the crest values of discharge voltage with respect to discharge current.\n5.8.4  System Voltage\nSystem voltages carry two designations: nominal voltage and maximum system voltage.\n5.8.4.1  Nominal Voltage:   Nominal voltage is the approximate phase-to-phase voltage\ndistinguishing one system from another.  The nominal voltage is the voltage by which the system may be\ndesignated and is near the voltage level at which the system normally operates.  The nominal voltage is\nusually approximately 5 to 10 percent below the maximum system voltage.\n5.8.4.2  Maximum System Voltage:  Maximum system voltage is the highest rms phase-to-phase\noperating voltage that occurs, the highest phase-to-phase voltage for which equipment is designed for\nsatisfactory continuous operation without derating of any kind.  It is the starting basis on which surge\narresters are applied.\nMaximum system voltages are generally those prescribed in ANSI Std. C84.1, “Voltage Ratings for\nElectric Power Systems and Equipment (60 Hz).”  On systems rated 345 kV and below, it is expected that\nthe maximum system voltage may be 5 to 10 percent higher than nominal voltage.\n5.8.5  Grounded vs. Ungrounded Systems\nSystems have been historically referred to as effectively grounded when coefficient* of grounding (COG)\ndoes not exceed 80 percent, or noneffectively grounded or ungrounded when coefficient* of grounding\nexceeds 80 percent."

In these\ncases, use ratios R0/Z and X0/Z1.  The COG for such systems may be as low as 67 percent.  On many\nhigh-voltage transmission systems, the COG may be as low as 70 percent.  Recognize the possibility of\nincreases in the COG due to system switching or changes.\nANSI/IEEE Std. C62.92, “IEEE Guide for the Application of Neutral Grounding in Electrical Utility\nSystems Part I—Introduction,” provides a more detailed and thorough discussion of the effects of\ngrounding and the calculation of the COG.\n5.8.6  Application Guide for Silicon-Carbide Valve Arresters\n5.8.6.1  General:   The voltage rating assigned to a surge arrester should exceed the maximum 60 Hz\nvoltage across its terminals during normal or fault conditions.  In general, the surge arrester voltage rating\nshould be at least 25 percent higher than the phase-to-ground voltage when the system is operating at\nmaximum phase-to-phase voltage.\nOn an isolated neutral system, which may be a delta system or an ungrounded-wye system, this rating\nshould be approximately 105 percent of, and never less than, the maximum rating of the system.  Such an\narrester is called a “full-rated” or 100 percent arrester.  On effectively grounded systems, the arrester\nmaximum rating can generally be 80 percent or less of the maximum system voltage.  In special cases,\narresters as low as 75 percent or even 70 percent of maximum system voltage rating may be applied,\ndepending on the coefficient of grounding of the system.\n5.8.6.2  Maximum Phase-to-Ground Voltage:   The first step recommended in selecting a lightning\narrester is to determine the maximum phase-to-ground power-frequency overvoltage at the arrester\nlocation.  This maximum overvoltage may occur as a result of a fault condition, sudden loss of load, or\nresonance.  Overvoltages experienced as a result of loss of load or resonance are determined by system\noperating experience or by computer studies.  Overvoltages that result from these two conditions are not\nexpected to be significant for most applications at 230 kV and below.\nAt 345 kV, the switching surge protection level may be more significant than the lightning impulse\nprotection level.  At the higher voltage level, capacitance of the line will be more significant.  On any\nlong line, the voltage of the line will increase over distance.  With the line energized during switching\noperations from one end of the line only, the remote end will experience a voltage increase.  In addition, if*The coefficient of grounding (COG)  is the ratio of E LG /E LL.  The COG is e xpressed as a\npercentage of the highest root-mean-square line- to-ground power-frequency voltage , E LG, on a\nsound phase, at a selected location, during a fault  to ground affecting one or more phases to the\nline-to-line power-frequency voltage , E LL, that would be obtained, at the selected location, with\nthe fault removed."

The additional line capacitance will tend to make the line more susceptible\nto transients than the lower voltage lines.  Switching of a 345 kV line terminated with a transformer could\nresult in transients if resonance conditions are present.  These conditions could result in the overstressing\nof surge arresters due to multiple restrikes through the arrester.  Transient network analysis (TNA) or\nelectromagnetic transient program analysis (EMTP) may be necessary to determine the size of the arrester\nto be applied.  The study could also determine other means to control transient overvoltage conditions\nsuch as the application of reactors, pre-insertion resistors, or specific operating practices to be followed\nduring switching.\nDetermination of the overvoltage due to a fault condition is necessary for any power system where less\nthan full line-to-line rated arresters are to be considered.  The maximum line-to-line voltage at the point of\narrester application multiplied by the COG based on a fault at the arrester location will often result in the\nmaximum voltage to be applied.  This may vary, however, depending on the system configuration.  The\napplication of neutral impedance elements may shift the location of the maximum voltage on a line with\nthe shift of the transformer neutral during a phase-to-ground fault.\nThe COG may be estimated using the graphs of Figure 5-33 or calculated from system values.  When\ncalculating the COG for use with machines, the subtransient reactance of the machine is recommended for\nuse.  With EHV systems, consider the effects of shunt reactors, capacitance, series capacitance, or\nreactors when applicable.\n5.8.6.3  Protective Margins:  The lower the arrester rating on a given system, the greater the\nprotective margin for the insulation of the protected equipment.  When system studies or calculations\nshow that protective margins would be more than adequate, the BIL of major equipment may be reduced\nfor substantial savings.  Generally, the accepted practice is to provide a minimum margin of 20 percent\nbetween transformer BIL and surge arrester maximum IR, and 15 percent in the case of switching surges.\nThe switching surge withstand strength of transformer insulation is usually specified at 83 percent of\nimpulse BIL.  Greater margins may be required where a condition of insulation degradation may be\npresent.\nExamine the protective margins over the full volt–time characteristics of the insulation that is to be\nprotected and the volt–time characteristics of the arrester.  Also maintain sufficient margin regardless of\nthe relative physical location of the arrester and protected equipment in the substation.  Locate the arrester\nas close to the major equipment as possible, and the arrester ground resistance should be low.  Connect\nsurge arrester grounds reliably to the substation ground grid and with the frames of all equipment being\nprotected.\n5.8.6.4  Thermal Capacity:  The arrester thermal capacity or ability to pass repeated or long-duration\nsurge currents (such as switching surges) without an internal temperature rise, which could fail the\narrester, has to be checked.  This is especially true in all cases where there are long lines or shunt\ncapacitor banks with high stored energy.  Available switching surge energy increases as the square of the\nsystem voltage and directly with the length of lines.  Thus, on 138 kV lines of equal length to 69 kV lines,\nthe surge arresters have to have at least four times the discharge capacity.\n5.8.6.5  Direct Stroke Shielding:  Surge arresters are applied primarily based on their effectiveness\nin limiting overvoltages in the form of traveling waves entering the substation over connecting lines.\nHigh-energy lightning strokes hitting a substation bus at or near the arrester could easily destroy the\narrester while it is attempting to pass the surge current to ground.  Even if the arrester is not destroyed, the"

Traveling waves coming into a substation will divert\npart of the energy in the wave over all line connections.  It is difficult, however, to take full advantage of\nthis since one cannot be sure the lines will be connected when needed.  In addition, in substations with\nlong buses, etc., the distances sometimes prevent effective use of this principle.\n5.8.6.7  Standards and Guides:  There are two principal national standards or guides pertaining to\nsilicon-carbide valve surge arresters: IEEE Stds. C62.1 and C62.2.\n5.8.6.7.1  IEEE C62.1, “IEEE Standard for Gapped Silicon-Carbide Surge Arresters for Alternating-\nCurrent Power Circuits.”  This standard contains much basic information on arresters such as definitions,\nservice conditions, classification and voltage ratings, performance characteristics and tests, test\nprocedures, design tests, conformance tests, and construction.  Some pertinent sections are as follows:\na. Section 4, Service Conditions.\nb. Standard arresters are designed for ambient temperatures not exceeding 40 °C (104 °F) and\naltitudes not exceeding 1800 meters (6000 feet).\nc. Section 5.1, Table 1 (see Table 5-52), Voltage in Kilovolts, lists the standard voltage ratings\navailable in distribution-, intermediate-, and station-class arresters.\nd. Section 7.2, Table 2, Test Requirements for Arrester Classification, summarizes the sections\ndealing with test requirements for the different arrester classifications: distribution,\nintermediate, and station.\ne. Section 8.1, Table 3, Insulation Withstand Test Voltages, lists the various insulation\nrequirements of all ratings of the different arrester classifications, with the internal parts\nremoved.\nf. Section 8.9, Table 5 (see Table 5-53), Pressure-Relief Test Currents for Station and\nIntermediate Arresters, lists the symmetrical rms amperes short-circuit capability of various\nratings of station and intermediate arresters.\n5.8.6.7.2  A guide for application of valve-type lightning arresters for alternating-current systems can\nbe found in ANSI/IEEE Std. C62.2.  This standard is an excellent guide on application of arresters.  It\ncontains information on general procedures; systematic procedures for protection of transformers and\nsubstation equipment; and protection of other equipment such as booster transformers, reactors, current\ntransformers, etc.  Of particular interest is the Typical Voltage–Time Curve for Coordination of Arrester\nProtective Levels with Insulation Withstand Strength (see Figure 5-34).

C62.2, Surge Arrester Applications for EHV Systems, provides important\nconsiderations concerning switching surges.  It is generally necessary to consider switching surge\nprotective levels only for application on systems above 69 kV.  In most cases, insulation coordination\nlevels will not be affected by switching surges except at levels at 345 kV or above.\n5.8.6.8  Guide Steps for Application of Valve-Type Surge Arresters for AC Systems (see IEEE\nStd. 62.2):  An example of surge arrester selection will be worked out along with each guide step to\nillustrate the procedure.  The example is arrester selection for a 230 kV substation coordinated with the\ntransformer BIL.  The 230 kV substation is supplied by one 230 kV line.  Both the substation and the line\nare effectively shielded.\n5.8.6.8.1  Determine the maximum phase-to-ground temporary overvoltage  at the arrester location.  In\nmost cases, this will depend on the coefficient of system grounding.\nExample:  At the surge arrester location, system parameters are known to be:\nRl = R2 = 0.1 ∗X1,   R0 /X1 = 0.8,  and  X0 /X1 = 2.5\nFrom curve (B) of Figure 5-33, the coefficient of grounding is 75 percent.  Maximum system voltage is\n230 kV x 1.05 or 242 kV.  Maximum phase-to-ground overvoltage during a ground fault is 242 kV x 0.75\nor 181 kV.  No other conditions including switching configurations are considered to result in temporary\novervoltages that will exceed this voltage level.\n5.8.6.8.2  Estimate the waveshape and magnitude of arrester discharge current.  The magnitude is\ndetermined largely by the effectiveness of the shielding against direct lightning strokes.\nExample: The standard arrester discharge current curve (a 8 x 20 µs wave) represents the most severe\ncurrent waveshape to be expected at a substation that is effectively shielded.  Surge arrester discharge\nvoltage characteristics (IR drop) are based on this standard curve.  A conservative value of maximum\ncurrent with effective shielding is 10 kA.  The current could reach as high as 20 kA or higher if the\nsubstation is not effectively shielded.\n5.8.6.8.3  Tentatively select arrester class and voltage rating.\nExample:  A station-class surge arrester has to be selected since this is the only type available at this\nvoltage level.  The substation size and importance may indicate a station-class arrester regardless of\nsystem voltage.  Arrester voltage rating has to be at least 181 kV, as determined in Step 1. Another rule of\nthumb recommends that the arrester voltage rating be not less than 125 percent of the voltage to ground\nwhen the system is operating at maximum system voltage:\n1.25 x 1.05 x 230 kV/ 3 = 174 kV\nThe next standard arrester rating above 174 kV and 181 kV is 192 kV.  Therefore, 192 kV is selected as\nthe tentative arrester rating."

The necessary information may be obtained from the arrester manufacturer or approximately\nfrom Appendix A of IEEE Std. 62.1 (see Table 5-53).\nExample:  Typical surge arrester characteristics are obtained from the arrester manufacturer’s published\ndata.  These characteristics include maximum sparkover (S.O.) on front of wave; maximum S.O. on full\nwave of 1.2 x 50 µs; maximum S.O. on switching surge (S.S.), maximum discharge voltage for 5, 10, and\n20 kA of discharge current; and minimum S.O. on 60 Hz voltage.  Typical characteristics are shown\nplotted on Figure 5-34.\nCalculate the maximum theoretical surge voltages that could appear at the insulation to be protected.\nThese will depend on many factors, such as effectiveness of shielding, number of lines normally\nconnected, and relative location of an arrester to protected equipment.\nExample:  For most applications, it is sufficient to rely on the recommended minimum margins between\nprotection levels provided by the surge arrester and the BIL of the protected equipment.  See Section\n5.8.6.8.5.\nCalculate the minimum permissible withstand strength of the insulation to be protected.  The necessary\ninformation may be obtained from manufacturers of the equipment.   Approximate information may be\nobtained from applicable standards on the type of equipment.\nExample:  The impulse withstand strength of equipment is defined by its full-wave impulse test voltage\nusing a standard 1.2 x 50 µs wave.  The strength is greater for shorter duration voltage peaks.  See Fig-\nure 5-35 for curves showing withstand strength of a power transformer over the range of 0 to 5,000 µs.\n5.8.6.8.5  Evaluation of Insulation Coordination :  (Front of Wave 20 percent; maximum discharge 20\npercent; maximum switching surge 15 percent.)\nExample:  See Figure 5-35 for the coordination of surge arrester protective levels with 230 kV\ntransformer BIL.  Possible BILs of 900, 825, 750, and 650 kV are shown.  All BILs are adequately\nprotected from impulses or switching surges.  However, other factors have to be considered such as 60 Hz\nwithstand, both internal and external; future deterioration of the insulation; surge arrester location with\nrespect to the transformer; etc.  A BIL of 750 kV would appear to be a proper choice based on the\nconditions assumed.  The surge arrester voltage rating of 192 kV is a proper selection unless there are\nunusual system conditions that could subject the arrester to voltages above its rating.\n5.8.6.8.6  Insulation Coordination Calculation Iterations :  When coordination cannot be achieved, the\nsolution may be to select a different arrester, improve arrester location relative to protected equipment,\nincrease the insulation level of protected equipment, improve shielding, or install additional arresters.\n5.8.6.8.7  Transformer Arrester Rating Coordination :  When the transformer high-voltage side arrester\nhas been chosen, compare the rating on a per unit basis to the arrester rating for the low-voltage winding.\nThe arrester applied to the low voltage of a transformer should have a rating slightly higher than the rating\nof the high-voltage winding.  An impulse that hits the high-voltage winding will also be transformed to\nthe low-voltage winding via the transformer turns ratio with the corresponding voltage and current.  If the\nenergy is discharged through the low-voltage winding arresters, the current discharged through the low-\nvoltage winding arresters will be the transformer turns ratio times the high-voltage arrester discharge"

Make sure that energy will discharge through the high-voltage winding arresters before it will\ndischarge through the low-voltage winding arresters.\n5.8.7  Application Guide for Metal Oxide Surge Arresters\nMetal oxide arresters were developed after the application of silicon-carbide valve arresters to electric\npower systems.  The primary component of the arrester that differentiates metal oxide arresters from the\nprevious arresters is the zinc oxide valve that has significantly greater non-linear volt – current\ncharacteristics as compared to previous devices.  The zinc oxide valve operates more closely to that of a\nzener diode that is applied in the electronic industry.  The valve is capable of being applied without any\ngaps in the design, eliminating the sparkover characteristic of previous arresters (see Figure 5-36) as it\neases into conduction.  The zinc oxide valve typically provides lower discharge voltages than available\nwith previous designs.\nFigure 5-36:  Gapless Metal Oxide Surge Arrester.  Ref. IEEE Std. C62.22-1991, Figure 1.\nCopyright © 1991.  IEEE.  All rights reserved.\n5.8.7.1  Types of Metal Oxide Surge Arresters:  In addition to the silicon-carbide station,\nintermediate, and distribution classes of arresters, development of the metal oxide arrester has produced\nthree basic categories of arresters.  These categories are known as the gapless, shunt-gapped, and series-\ngapped metal oxide arresters.\n5.8.7.1.1  Gapless Metal Oxide Surge Arresters :  Gapless arresters consist of a stack or multiple stacks\nof metal oxide disks (see Figure 5-36).  Above the MCOV rating, the arrester exhibits a very non-linear\nbehavior.  This arrester is applied directly to the line terminal and ground with only its inherent\nimpedance limiting the amount of leakage current through the arrester.\n5.8.7.1.2  Shunt-Gapped Metal Oxide Surge Arresters :  Shunt-gapped metal oxide arresters consist of\na stack of metal oxide disks that are bridged by shunt gaps (See Figure 5-37).  When the disks start to\nconduct current upon the arrival of a surge, the discharge voltage will increase to the point where the gaps\nwill spark over and short the associated disks.  The sparkover of the gaps, typically at several hundred\namps (range B to C), has the effect of reducing the discharge voltage of the arrester (range D to E).  A\ndecrease in the amount of discharge current will eventually extinguish the gap current, causing the voltage\nto increase to its initial curve, A-B-C."

All rights reserved.\n5.8.7.1.3  Series-Gapped Metal Oxide Surge Arresters :  The series-gapped metal oxide arresters use\nfewer disks in series with a series gap impedance network (see Figure 5-38).  As the arrester starts to\nconduct, the voltage is divided between the disks and the gap network.  When the voltage across the\ngapped impedance network increases to the point the gap sparks over, the voltage is reduced across the\ntotal arrester to be that which is across the metal oxide disks.\nFigure 5-38:  Series-Gapped Metal Oxide Surge Arrester.\nRef. IEEE Std. C62.22-1991, Figure 3.\nCopyright © 1991.  IEEE.

The system parameters of the maximum system\noperating voltage and temporary overvoltages are of primary importance in the application of this type of\narrester.  The discharge current levels are also important to the application of this arrester.\n5.8.7.2  Operating Conditions:  Usual operating conditions for surge arresters include continuous air\ntemperature ratings between –40 °C and +40 °C with maximum air temperatures of +60 °C at elevations\nless than 1800 meters (6000 ft).

Confirm special operating\nconditions with the manufacturer before the applications are made.\n5.8.7.3  Maximum Phase-to-Ground Voltage\n5.8.7.3.1  Maximum Continuous Operating Voltage :  Metal oxide arresters are applied primarily based\non the MCOV.  Metal oxide arresters have been assigned dual voltage ratings based on the conventional\nduty-cycle rating and the newer MCOV rating (see Table 5-57).  Of primary importance is the\nrequirement that the MCOV of the applied arrester be above the maximum continuous operating voltage\nof the electric system.  For a solidly grounded system with the maximum operating allowance of 5\npercent, the minimum MCOV is calculated using Equation 5-7:\nEquation 5-7\nMCOV (MIN)   =  E LL * k /3\nWhere:\nk = Percentage of operating voltage allowance over the nominal operating voltage\nFor a 34.5 kV nominal voltage solidly grounded system with a 5 percent maximum operating voltage\nallowance, the MCOV is calculated as follows:\n34.5 kV ∗ 1.05 /3 = 21 kV\nAccording to Table 5-57, the nearest MCOV rating above this value is 22 kV.  This would be the\nminimum rating of the arrester to receive consideration.\nThe application of arresters on ungrounded or impedance-grounded systems is normally applied on the\nbasis of their associated duty-cycle rating.  Using the arresters on the basis of 100 percent voltage\napplication, the minimum duty-cycle rating for the arresters on an ungrounded system will be the\nmaximum anticipated operating line-to-line voltage.  For a 34.5 kV nominal voltage impedance-grounded\nor ungrounded system with a 5 percent maximum operating voltage allowance, the duty-cycle rating is\ncalculated as follows:\nRating = E LL * k\nWhere:\nk = Percentage of operating voltage allowance over the nominal operating voltage\nFor a 34.5 kV system,\n34.5 kV ∗ 1.05  = 36.2 kV\nAccording to Table 5-57, the next highest duty-cycle voltage rating for the arrester is 39 kV.  The\ncorresponding MCOV for this arrester is 31.5 kV.  With this MCOV rating, the arrester will move into\nconduction should one of the phases be grounded or be faulted.  It then becomes a judgment of the\nengineer to assess the amount of time the arrester will be required to conduct under these conditions.\nApplying a metal oxide arrester under these conditions will make use of the inherent improved temporary\novervoltage capabilities of the devices.  Follow the manufacturer’s recommendations regarding the extent\nof overvoltage capabilities for a particular arrester when applying arresters on this basis."

These conditions may arise due to conditions that include line-to-ground fault\nconditions, loss of neutral on a normally grounded system, sudden load rejection, oscillations due to\nsystem resonance, switching surges, switching conditions, etc.\nEvaluate each of the conditions resulting in temporary overvoltage in terms of the effect it has on the\nsystem.  The magnitude and duration of the overvoltage will assist in determining the proper application\nof the arresters.  Metal oxide arresters have a significantly improved ability to operate during temporary\novervoltages.  Manufacturers typically publish curves to indicate the magnitudes and durations of\novervoltages under which the arresters will successfully operate (see Figure 5-39).  Apply the arresters\nwithin the limitations the manufacturer recommends for acceptable overvoltage within the manufacturer’s\nspecified time limits.\nFigure 5-39:  Typical 60-Hz Temporary Overvoltage Capability for Metal Oxide Arresters\nTemporary overvoltages are most often associated with the overvoltages experienced by the unfaulted\nphases during a phase-to-ground fault.

The same procedures are used here.\n5.8.7.4.2  Switching Surge Impulse Currents :  Switching surges are seldom a consideration below 345\nkV.  Accurate determination of surge withstand capabilities will require a transient network analysis or\nelectromagnetic transient study to be performed.  These studies can simulate the transmission system\nelements, including the arresters, determine the surge levels that are expected, and size the surge arresters\nbased on the energy absorption characteristics of the arresters.

Procedures for establishing the coordination are previously given for silicon-\ncarbide arresters.\nTypical characteristics collected include the front of wave value at 0.5 µs, the maximum switching surge\nprotective level, and maximum discharge voltages at 5 kA, 10 kA, and 20 kA.  Since the metal oxide\narresters have no sparkover, the front-of-wave value is used in place of the sparkover value.\nAcceptable protective margins are considered to be similar to the silicon-carbide protective levels.\nGenerally accepted practice is to provide a 20 percent margin between the transformer front of wave\n(TFOW) strength and the arrester front of wave rating based on the arrester front of wave rating (AFOW),\na 20 percent margin between the BIL withstand rating (BIL) and the arrester lightning protective level\n(LPL), and a 15 percent margin between the transformer switching surge withstand (BSL) and the arrester\nsurge protective level (SPL).

Some pertinent sections are as follows:\na. Section 4, Service Conditions.\nb. Standard arresters are designed for ambient temperatures not exceeding 40 °C (104 °F) and\naltitudes not exceeding 1800 meters (6000 feet).\nc.

An example of surge arrester selection will be worked out\nalong with each guide step to illustrate the procedure.  The example is arrester selection for a 230 kV\nsubstation coordinated with the transformer BIL.

It may be desirable to also locate arresters at the line entrances or,\nin some cases, on a bus that may be connected to several lines.  They should be located to give maximum\npossible protection to all major substation equipment.\nIn many cases, the arresters protecting the main transformer may be mounted directly on the transformer.\nLightning strokes can produce surges with steep wave fronts, voltage gradients, reflections, or oscillations\nand high rates of rise of current, which can result in large differences in the line-to-ground voltage\nbetween even closely spaced points.  It is extremely important to locate the arresters as close as practical\nto the apparatus requiring protection.  The arrester lead length should be kept as short as practical.  If\npossible, the arrester should be connected directly to the jumper connecting the equipment to the system.\nFollowing is a general guide for determining maximum separation distances between arrester lead tap and\ntransformer, considering the effect of arrester lead length.\n5.8.8.2  Arrester Separation Distance and Lead Length\n5.8.8.2.1  Impressed Voltage :  The voltage impressed on the substation transformer after arrester\noperation may be much higher than the arrester discharge voltage if either arrester separation distance (S)\nor lead length (L) is excessive.  Consequently, these factors have to always be considered in applying\narresters.  Application curves have been developed to facilitate this.\n5.8.8.2.2  Separation Distance :  Arrester separation distance (S) is defined as the distance from the line\narrester lead junction to the transformer bushing.  Voltage reflections result when the discharge voltage\ntraveling as a wave arrives at the transformer.  If the arrester is very close to the transformer, these\nreflections are cancelled almost instantaneously by opposite polarity reflections from the arrester.  As the\nseparation distance increases, the cancellation becomes less and less effective, and the voltage at the\ntransformer may increase to almost twice the arrester discharge voltage.\n5.8.8.2.3  Lead Length :  Arrester lead length (L) is defined as the total length of the conductor from the\njunction of the surge arrester lead with the line or transformer circuit to physical ground, but not including\nthe length of the arrester itself.  When the arrester discharges, surge current flows to ground over the lead\nlength.  The resulting voltage drop, L di/dt, is proportional to the lead length and adds to the arrester\ndischarge voltage.\n5.8.8.2.4  Surge Voltage Increase :  The increase in surge voltage due to separation distance and lead\nlength may be evaluated by the method given in AIEE Transactions Paper 63-229.  It will be satisfactory,\nhowever, to use the application curves from this reference, which are reproduced as Figures 5-43, 5-44,\nand 5-45, to determine maximum lead lengths and separation distances for high-side arresters, provided\nthat modern arresters are used.  For this purpose, any arrester manufactured in the United States during or\nafter 1960 may be considered modern."

However,\nthey should be connected close enough to protect the switch adequately when the switch is closed.  Line\nentrance gaps may be used on the line side for protection when the switch is open.  See Section 5.8.9,\nProtection at Line Entrances.\n5.8.8.3.3  Arresters of the valve type may be installed on the low-voltage distribution bus.  They\nshould be installed on the load side of the feeder overcurrent device (recloser, fuse, or circuit breaker) and\nany related disconnecting switch.\n5.8.8.3.4  Continuous metallic sheath cables from substation to overhead lines should be protected by\narresters at the junction, and should be grounded effectively at the base of the cable terminal structure and\ndirectly to the cable sheath.  If the overhead line is unshielded, additional protective devices may be\nrequired a few spans before the junction.\nThe cable sheath should be bonded to the substation ground at the substation end.  It may also be\nnecessary to install arresters at the substation equipment end if the cable is such that two times the\nprotection level of the junction arrester exceeds 80 percent of the substation BIL.  This is due to reflection\nat the equipment end.\n5.8.8.3.5  On high-voltage wye-connected transformers with ungrounded neutral, voltage reflections at\nthe neutral can approach two times the voltage applied simultaneously at the line terminals.  It is therefore\nnecessary to employ a surge arrester from neutral to ground to limit these surge voltages, especially if the\ntransformer has graded insulation.  The rating of the arrester should be approximately 1.2 times the\nnormal line-to-neutral system voltage.\n5.8.9  Protection at Line Entrances\nLightning wave fronts may approach 1000 kV/ µs, resulting in a gradient of 3.3 kV/m difference in line-\nto-ground potential.  Most, however, do not exceed 500 kV/ µs, and this value is considered a basis for\ngood practice.  At open circuit points, these waves are reflected back at nearly double the original rate of\nrise, increasing the possibility of a flashover or equipment damage close to that point.  It is apparent that\nprotection should be considered for the line entrances on large substations, especially where line breakers\nand disconnect switches may be open, constituting dead-end reflections.  Surge arresters will provide the\nmost effective means of protection, but line entrance gaps may be sufficient.  Line entrance protective\ngaps may be considered as an economical alternative to surge arresters at substation entrances of all\noverhead lines 23 kV and above to provide additional protection for substation insulation under the\nfollowing conditions:\n1. When steep front incoming surges would break down insulation near the line entrance or on the\nbus  (station arresters may be far too distant to provide adequate protection);\n2. When part of the station insulation is isolated from protective influence of the station arresters\nby switching; and\n3. When the station arrester has been damaged or otherwise removed from service so that its\nprotection is not available"

Figures 5-46 and 5-47 show single- and three-phase\nreclosure, respectively.\n5.9.1.1  Purpose:   Reclosers are installed to provide maximum continuity of service to distribution\nloads, simply and economically, by removing a permanently faulted circuit from the system or by instant\nclearing and reclosing on a circuit subjected to a temporary fault caused by lightning, trees, wildlife, or\nsimilar causes.  Unlike fuse links, which interrupt either temporary or permanent faults indiscriminately,\nreclosers are able to distinguish between the two types of faults, permanent and temporary.  They give\ntemporary faults repeated chances to clear or to be cleared by a subordinate protective device.  If the fault\nis not cleared, the recloser recognizes the fault as permanent and operates to lock out or, in some\napplications, hold closed (see Section 5.9.5.4)."

( see Figure 5-48).  Their proper application\nrequires a study of the load and short-circuit characteristics of both the protecting and the protected\nequipment.  This includes high-voltage fuses or other protection in the supply to a substation transformer\nbank, a circuit breaker or reclosers at the distribution voltage supplying the feeder at the substation,\nvarious line reclosers, sectionalizers, line fuses, the wire arc burn-down characteristic at the fault location,\nground resistance, etc.  In selecting reclosers, it is recommended that the procedure outlined in ANSI\nStd.

They can also be used on three-phase circuits where the load is\npredominantly single phase.  Thus, when a permanent phase-to-ground fault occurs, one phase can be\nlocked out while service is maintained to the remaining two-thirds of the system.\n5.9.2.1.2  Three-Phase Reclosers :  Three-phase reclosers are used where lockout of all three phases is\nrequired for any permanent fault.  They are also used to prevent single phasing of three-phase loads, such\nas large three-phase motors. Three-phase reclosers have two modes of operation.\n5.9.2.1.2.1  The first, single-phase trip and three-phase lockout, consists of three single-phase reclosers\nmounted in a single tank, with mechanical interconnection for lockout only.

If any phase operates to lockout condition due to a\npermanent fault, the mechanical linkage trips open the other two phases and locks them open.  Thus,\nextended single-phase energization of three-phase loads is prevented.  This type of operation is provided\nfor smaller recloser types.\n5.9.2.1.2.2  Larger reclosers make use of the second mode of operation: three-phase trip with three-\nphase lockout.  For any fault—single-phase-to-ground, phase-to-phase, or three-phase—all contacts\noperate simultaneously for each trip operation.  The three phases, mechanically linked together for\ntripping and reclosing, are operated by a common mechanism.\n5.9.2.2  Control Intelligence:  The intelligence that enables a recloser to sense overcurrents, select\ntiming operation, time the tripping and reclosing functions, and finally lock out, is provided by its control.\nThere are two basic types of control schemes used: integral “hydraulic” control or “electronic” control\nlocated in a separate cabinet.  A recloser employs one of these controls.\n5.9.2.2.1  Hydraulic Recloser Control :  Hydraulic recloser control is used in single-phase reclosers and\nin smaller ratings of three-phase reclosers.  It is built as an integral part of the recloser.  With this type of\ncontrol, an overcurrent is sensed by a trip-coil connected in series with the line.  When the overcurrent\nflows through the coil, a plunger is drawn into the coil to trip open the recloser contacts.  Timing and\nsequencing are accomplished by pumping oil through separate hydraulic chambers or ducts.\n5.9.2.2.2  Electronic Recloser Control :  Electronic recloser control is used with some single-phase\nreclosers and larger three-phase reclosers.  Compared to the hydraulic control, it is more flexible, more\neasily adjusted, and more accurate.  The electronic control, housed in a cabinet separate from the recloser,\nconveniently permits changing timing, trip current levels, and sequences of recloser operations without\nde-energizing or untanking the recloser.  A wide range of accessories are available from metering\ncapabilities on some models to modifying the basic operation, solving many different application\nproblems.\nLine current is sensed by special sensing current transformers in the recloser.  The recloser and control are\nconnected by a multiconductor control cable that carries sensing transformer secondary currents to the\ncontrol and the necessary trip and reclose signals from the control to the recloser.  A dc battery either\nsupplies the control or provides backup, ensuring adequate operating power under all fault conditions.\nMost reclosers require an external ac source either to charge the dc battery or provide control power.\n5.9.2.3  Tripping:  Series coil and non-series coil tripping are characteristics of individual\nclassifications of reclosers.\n5.9.2.3.1  Series Coil Tripping :  Series coil tripping is used on hydraulically controlled single-phase\nreclosers and three-phase reclosers.  Sensing of fault current is provided by a series-connected solenoid\ncoil (magnetic actuator) that carries its rated line current.  When a fault occurs, tripping is initiated by the\nsolenoid plunger.  The plunger, normally held at rest by the closing springs, is pulled into the coil and\ncauses overtoggling of trip springs in the operating mechanism that opens the recloser contacts.\nTripping simultaneously charges closing springs that then close or reclose the recloser when the proper\nclosing signal is present, thus making the recloser ready for another tripping operation.\n5.9.2.3.2  Non-Series Coil Tripping :  Non-series coil tripping is used on some single-phase vacuum\nreclosers and some three-phase reclosers.  It may consist of a tripping solenoid, energized from an"

It may also consist of a tripping spring simply released by a small tripping solenoid also\nexternally energized.  In both cases, the tripping spring is previously charged by a closing solenoid or\nclosing motor during a closing or reclosing operation of the recloser.  Other technologies do not utilize\nspring charging, relying on the solenoid to perform the tripping operation.\n5.9.2.4  Closing:   Various methods of closing and reclosing are available, depending on the recloser\nselected.\n5.9.2.4.1  Spring Closing :  Spring closing is utilized on most single-phase and some three-phase\nreclosers.  In each case, the closing spring is charged during a previous tripping operation.\n5.9.2.4.2  Solenoid Closing :  Solenoid closing is utilized on some single-phase and some three-phase\nreclosers.  The solenoid coil may be high-voltage ac and connected line to grounded neutral or it may be\nlow-voltage dc energized from a battery.  A low-voltage rectifier accessory is also available to permit use\nof local ac power supply for closing.  Some methods utilize solenoid closing to charge the tripping\nsprings in preparation for the next tripping operation.\n5.9.2.4.3  Motor Closing :  Motor closing is utilized on some three-phase reclosers.  The motor charges\nthe closing springs and forces their overtoggle to close the recloser.  The closing spring action\nsimultaneously charges the tripping springs.  The motor is energized from an external power supply.\n5.9.2.5  Interrupter Types :  Reclosers utilize either oil, vacuum, or SF 6 as the interrupting medium.\n5.9.2.5.1  Oil Interruption :  Oil interruption is utilized on most single-phase and some three-phase\nreclosers.  Reclosers utilizing oil for current interruption use the same oil for basic insulation.  Most\nreclosers with hydraulic control also use the same oil for timing and counting functions.\n5.9.2.5.2  Vacuum Interruption :  Vacuum interruption is utilized on a few single-phase and some three-\nphase reclosers.  It has the advantages of lower maintenance frequency and minimum external force\nreaction during interruption.  Some vacuum reclosers may utilize oil as the basic insulating medium,\ndepending on the recloser selected.\n5.9.2.5.3  SF6 Interruption :  SF6 interruption is utilized on some three-phase reclosers.  In addition to\nhaving the same advantages as vacuum interruption, SF 6 is a better insulating medium than oil or air.\nNOTE :  The term “Type” is a manufacturer’s designation to identify each particular group or family of\nreclosers that it produces.  It covers the major classifying features and certain rating and performance\ncharacteristics.\nRUS IP 202-1 contains a listing of RUS accepted recloser manufacturers, some on conditional basis.\n5.9.3  Recloser Ratings\nAutomatic circuit reclosers are rated in terms of various voltages, frequency, continuous current,\nminimum tripping current, interrupting current, and making current.  In operating a recloser, the\nlimitations imposed by a given recloser rating should not be exceeded in any respect; otherwise, excessive\nmaintenance or unsatisfactory operation may be experienced."

Voltage ratings of automatic circuit reclosers are shown in ANSI/IEEE\nStd. C37.60, “IEEE Standard Requirements for Overhead, Pad Mounted, Dry Vault, and Submersible\nAutomatic Circuit Reclosers and Fault Interrupters for AC Systems,” (Tables 5-60, 5-61, and 5-62).\nNOTE:   Some reclosers can be operated at system voltages lower than rated voltage.  Series coil,\nhydraulically operated reclosers can be applied at a lower voltage without modification, and in such cases\nmay gain an increase in interrupting current capability.  Non-series coil—shunt coil closing, spring\ntripping—reclosers can be applied at a lower voltage by installing a closing coil of the appropriate system\nvoltage rating.  No change is necessary if the closing coil is low voltage and is supplied from an external\nac or dc auxiliary power source.  Consult manufacturers and their literature for proper application of\nreclosers at voltages lower than rated voltage.\n5.9.3.1.3  Rated Impulse Withstand Voltage :  Rated impulse withstand voltage of reclosers is a\nperformance characteristic specified in ANSI/IEEE Std. C37.60 as a test requirement.  This test\ndemonstrates the ability of the recloser to withstand lightning and other fast impulse voltages.  The\nvoltage wave is a standard 1.2 x 50 µs wave and may be either positive or negative polarity.\n5.9.3.2  Rated Frequency:   The rated frequency of reclosers is 60 Hz.  Consult the manufacturer if\noperation at other frequencies is being considered.\n5.9.3.3  Rated Continuous Current:  The rated continuous current is the magnitude of current in rms\namperes that the recloser is designed to carry continuously.  The present continuous current ratings of\nautomatic circuit reclosers are shown in ANSI/IEEE Std. C37.60, Tables 5-60, 5-61, and 5-62.  In many\ncases, the basic continuous current rating of a given recloser is limited by the series trip solenoid coil\nrating installed in the recloser.  Therefore, as load current requirement increases, it is only necessary to\nreplace the solenoid coil with one having a larger rating.  See ANSI/IEEE Std. C37.60; Tables 5-63, 5-64,\nand 5-65."

Standard tripping pickup is 200 percent of the\ncontinuous current rating of the recloser coil.  Some reclosers are adjustable above or below the standard\ntripping pickup value.\n5.9.3.4.2  The minimum tripping current for shunt trip hydraulically controlled reclosers is as described\nfor series reclosers.  With electronically controlled reclosers, the minimum trip rating is variable and has\nno relation to the rated continuous current.  Information on specific reclosers should be obtained from the\nmanufacturer.\nThe differential between minimum trip and continuous current ratings normally provides sufficient\nmargin for load inrush current pickup after an extended outage on a feeder circuit.\n5.9.3.5  Rated Interrupting Current:  The rated interrupting current is the maximum rms symmetrical\ncurrent that a recloser is designed to interrupt under the standard operating duty, circuit voltage, and\nspecified circuit constants.  See ANSI/IEEE Std. C37.60, Tables 5-60 through 5-65.  This rating is stated\non the nameplate.  It is based on the capability of reclosers to interrupt the corresponding asymmetrical"

C37.60-1981,\nSection  5.6, “Rated Symmetrical Interrupting Current,” page 17.\n5.9.3.6  Rated Making Current:  The rated making current is the same value as the rated interrupting\ncurrent, including the corresponding asymmetry.  The recloser has to be capable of closing and latching\nclosed against the rated making current and holding closed until a tripping sequence is initiated.\n5.9.4  Construction\nMost automatic circuit reclosers consist of five major components: tank, bushings, mechanism,\ninterrupter, and controls.  Although Figures 5-46 and 5-47 refer to oil circuit reclosers, many reclosers\nconsist of the same basic components.\n5.9.4.1  Tank:   The tank is that part of the recloser that houses the interrupter and tripping and closing\nmechanisms.  The tank is usually made of steel and is rectangular for a three-phase recloser and\ncylindrical for a single-phase recloser.  The top is usually an aluminum casting that supports the various\ncomponents.  Some new technologies do not utilize tanks.  The interrupter may be enclosed in an epoxy\nbushing while the operating mechanism is enclosed in a steel housing.\n5.9.4.2  Bushings:   The bushings are the insulating structures including through-conductors with\nprovision for mounting on the top of the recloser.\n5.9.4.3  Operating Mechanism:   The operating mechanism of an automatic circuit recloser provides\nthe power to open, close, reclose, lock out, or hold closed the main contacts.  The tripping mechanism is\nthe device that releases the holding means and opens the main contacts.  In most cases, the opening force\nis furnished by springs that are charged by the closing mechanism.  An operating mechanism is shown in\nFigure 5-49.\nThe closing mechanism is a solenoid coil, springs, or a motor and gear arrangement.  The closing force\nserves to close the main contacts and at the same time charges the opening springs.  The lockout\nmechanism is the device that locks the main contacts in the open position following the completion of the\nsequence of operation.  The hold-closed mechanism is the device that holds the main contacts in the\nclosed position following the completion of a predetermined sequence of operation.  It holds the main\ncontacts closed as long as current flows in excess of a predetermined value.  When the current is reduced\nbelow this value, the hold-closed mechanism resets to its initial position.X/R is the ratio of reactance to resistance of a circuit at rated\nfrequency.  The rms value of asymmetrical fault current at any\ntime after initiation of the fault is dependent upon the\ninstantaneous voltage existing at the moment the fault is\ninitiated and upon the decrement of the direct current\ncomponent, which is determined by the X/R value of the\ncircuit."

The physical configuration and method of interruption vary with\nmanufacturer and recloser classification.\n5.9.4.5  Control:   Reclosers are provided with sequence control devices and operation integrator to\nchange the recloser from instantaneous operations to time-delay operations and to lock out the recloser\nafter a prescribed number of operations.  Individual tripping operations of a recloser can be made to\nfollow instantaneous or time-delay, time–current characteristics.  Reclosers are normally set for one of the\nfollowing sequences of operations:\na. Four time-delay operations\nb. One instantaneous operation followed by three time-delay operations\nc. Two instantaneous operations followed by two time-delay operations\nA number of different sequence control devices may be roughly classed into three types: hydraulic,\nmechanical, or electronic.  In the hydraulic type, an oil pump attached to the recloser plunger raises a trip\npiston a certain distance with each operation of the recloser.  This trip piston establishes the sequence of\nfast and delayed tripping operations and eventually locks the recloser open.  In the mechanical type, the\ntrip piston is mechanically operated by the lift rod one notch at a time to accomplish this sequencing.  The\nelectronic type of control utilizes solid-state circuitry to provide the intelligence for performing all the\ncommand functions or automatic operation.  Consult manufacturers’ literature for ratings and available\narrangements of electronic components."

The recloser contacts then reclose following a\npredetermined length of time (see Figure 5-50 – ANSI/IEEE Std. C37.60-1981, Fig. 1).  By the time the\nrecloser has reassessed the circuit, the sequence control device has moved to count the trip operation.  If\nthe fault still persists on the circuit when the recloser closes, the tripping and reclosing sequence is\nrepeated a predetermined number of times, as established by the sequence control device, until the\nrecloser goes to either the lockout or the hold-closed position.  If the fault has cleared from the circuit\nduring any open-circuit period, however, the recloser closes and remains closed, and the sequence control\ndevice resets so that it is in position for the next sequence of operations (see Figure 5-51).\nFigure 5-50:  Unit Operation.

If the recloser has a nonreclosing lever,\nthe nonreclosing lever should be pulled down as far as it will go in order to cut out the automatic\nreclosing before the recloser is manually tripped.\n5.9.5.2  Manual Closing:   An automatic circuit recloser can be closed manually by moving the manual-\noperating handle to the close position by means of a hookstick or, if the recloser is provided with remote"

If the recloser has a nonreclosing lever, the\nnonreclosing lever should be pulled down as far as it will go in order to cut out the automatic reclosing\nbefore the recloser is closed manually.  After the automatic circuit recloser has been successfully closed,\nthe automatic reclosing should be placed in service.\n5.9.5.3  Manual Reclosing After Lockout Operation:   Many reclosers in service are designed to lock\nout following a selected sequence of tripping and automatic reclosing operations.  The theory behind this\ntype of application is that, if a fault is temporary, it will be cleared during the instantaneous operation of\nthe recloser.  If the fault is permanent, the recloser goes into time-delay tripping operation and permits\nsectionalizing devices, such as fuses beyond the recloser, to open and isolate the fault.  If a permanent\nfault should occur between the recloser and the next sectionalizing device out on the line, the recloser\nthen goes to lockout and isolates the fault.\nWhen a recloser appears to be locked out, the operator is always faced with the possibility that the\nrecloser itself may have failed.  The following procedure is recommended for reclosing of the recloser\nafter a lockout operation.\n5.9.5.3.1  Make a careful visual inspection for evidence of distress such as throwing of oil or damaged\nbushings.\n5.9.5.3.2  Close the recloser with a hookstick, keeping the hook in the operating ring momentarily so\nthat the recloser can be opened manually in case local trouble or failure becomes evident.  If no local\ntrouble develops and the recloser again locks out after going through its proper sequence, it should not be\nreclosed again until the entire circuit on the load side to all sectionalizing devices has been patrolled and\ncleared if necessary."

It is normally set\nto trip instantaneously twice to permit a temporary fault to clear.  If the fault is permanent, the recloser\nlatches closed to permit the sectionalizing device nearest the fault to operate and isolate the fault.\nHowever, a fuse at the recloser opens the circuit when a permanent fault occurs between the hold-closed\nrecloser and the next sectionalizing device out on the line.  The fuse in series with the hold-closed\nrecloser is normally installed on the supply side of the recloser so that it also protects against electrical\nfailure in the recloser itself.  To reclose a recloser after a hold-closed operation, the following procedure\nis recommended.\n5.9.5.4.1  Make a careful visual inspection for evidence of distress such as throwing of oil or damaged\nbushings.\n5.9.5.4.2  If inspection under Section 5.9.5.4.1 indicates that everything is in order, the operator should\nfirst open the recloser with a hookstick, and then replace the fuse and close the cutout to check the\nrecloser on the supply side.  If everything is in order, the operator should open the series cutout and close\nthe recloser; then close the series cutout.  If there is no local trouble and service is still not restored, then\nthe load side to all sectionalizing devices should be patrolled to determine the cause of the tripout.\n5.9.5.5  Load Pickup:   The inrush current experienced in closing a recloser after a lockout operation\nmay occasionally introduce some difficulties in getting the recloser to latch closed.  The highest inrush\ncurrent can originate from automatic starting motors or magnetizing current of transformers; however,\nthese types of inrush currents are normally short lived (on the order of 3 to 30 cycles).  Some makes of\nreclosers may operate on the instantaneous trip due to this inrush current and may have to open and\nautomatically reclose, until the sequence of operation comes to the time-delay trip, before the recloser\nwill stay closed.  Other makes of reclosers, when reclosed after lockout, do not operate on the\ninstantaneous trip but have one time-delay trip operation to lock out, which will normally override the\ninrush current and pick up the load.  A cold-load pickup accessory is available on electronic controls for\nthree-phase reclosers.  This accessory temporarily increases the minimum pickup current to a sufficient\nvalue (usually double) to override the cold-load inrush current and allow the recloser to latch closed.\nCareful observation will indicate whether failure to hold the load is caused by a fault or by heavy\noverload.  Instant and perhaps violent action would indicate a fault, whereas some delay might mean\noverload due to inrush current.  In the latter case, sectionalizing to drop part of the load, rather than a\npatrol, may be necessary.  In any case, if nothing is found on patrol, then sectionalizing is indicated.\n5.9.6  Maintenance and Inspection\n5.9.6.1  Installation:   Before installing a recloser, check for external mechanical damage, oil level (oil-\nfilled reclosers), operating sequence as specified, and the record reading on the operation counter.\nPeriodic inspection and maintenance are essential to ensure efficient, trouble-free service of an automatic\ncircuit recloser.  Once an automatic circuit recloser is installed, it should be placed on a periodic schedule\nof test and inspection.  Frequency of maintenance should be based on the manufacturer’s recommenda-\ntions, elapsed time in service, and number of operations.  Many of the new vacuum technologies do not\nrequire the frequency of scheduled maintenance that traditional oil circuit reclosers do.  Such test and\ninspection should cover timing tests and checking of bushings for cracks and of the tank for oil leakage,\nas well as recording the counter reading.  Internal inspection should include contact maintenance or\nreplacement; a check of all gears, linkages, timing devices; test of the oil, etc."

C57.13: “An instrument transformer is a transformer that is intended to reproduce in its secondary\ncircuit, in a definite and known proportion, the current or voltage of its primary circuit with the phase\nrelations substantially preserved.”\nInstrument transformers also provide insulation between the primary and secondary circuits and thus\nsimplify the construction of measuring devices and provide safety for personnel using those devices.\nOccasionally, instrument transformers serve another duty as bus supports, especially at the higher\nvoltages where the cost of extra bus supports becomes significant.  The manufacturer should always be\nconsulted in such applications to determine what externally applied forces the product can withstand.\nIf necessary, a voltage transformer may be used for supplying power rather than for measurement.  In\nsuch situations, it is usually possible to place burdens higher than the volt-ampere rating on the secondary\ncircuit without excessive heating and consequent shortening of life.  The limit of such burden is known as\nthe Thermal Burden Rating, i.e., “The volt-ampere output that the transformer will supply continuously at\nrated secondary voltage without causing the specified temperature limits to be exceeded.”  The voltage\ntransformer’s accuracy of transformation will not be maintained for this type of use.\nThe primary national standard applicable to current and voltage transformers is ANSI/IEEE Std. C57.13,\n“IEEE Standard Requirements for Instrument Transformers.”  This standard covers all-important aspects,\nincluding terminology, general requirements, ratings, burdens, accuracy, construction, and test code.\n5.10.2  Service Conditions\nThe standard ratings of instrument transformers are based on operation at the thermal rating of the\ninstrument transformer for defined ambient temperature conditions, provided the altitude does not exceed\n1000 meters (3300 feet).\nInstrument transformers may be used at higher ambient temperatures, at altitudes higher than 1000\nmeters, or for other unusual conditions if the effects on performance are considered.  Consult the\nmanufacturer for specific applications.\n5.10.2.1  Altitude:  Table 5-33 in Section 5.5.3.5 shows the altitude correction factors to be used to\naccount for the adverse effect of decreased air density on the insulation withstand capability.  These\ncorrection factors modify the standard insulation classes shown in Table 5-66.  A higher standard BIL\nmay be required at high altitudes in order to obtain the insulation required for the voltage used.\nThe decreased air density at higher altitudes also affects heat dissipation and the permissible loading on\ninstrument transformers.  Current transformers may be operated at altitudes greater than 1000 meters if\nthe current is reduced below rated current by 0.3 percent for each 100 meters the altitude exceeds"

The RF is multiplied by the rated current to indicate the\ncurrent that can be carried continuously without exceeding the standard temperature limitations.  Fig-\nure 5-53 shows the permissible loading for given average cooling air temperatures and RFs.

The accuracy of transformation should, therefore, be either a known value so that the\nerrors can be included in the computation of the overall measurement, or the errors have to be within the\nlimits of a specified small value so they may be disregarded.\nThe accuracy obtainable with an instrument transformer depends on its design, circuit conditions, and the\nburden imposed on the secondary.  Accuracy is measured in terms of its true value and phase angle under\nspecified operating conditions.\n5.10.3.1  Accuracy Classes for Metering Service:  Accuracy classes for metering service have been\nestablished that limit the transformer correction factor (TCF) to specified values when the metered load\nhas a power factor of 0.6 lagging to 1.0.  The standard accuracy classes for metering service and\ncorresponding TCF limits for current and voltage transformers are shown in Table 5-68.  Higher accuracy\nclasses (e.g., 0.15) are available from some manufacturers."

It is a function of both the phase angles of the instrument\ntransformers and the power factor of the primary circuit being measured.\nThe phase angle correction factor corrects for the phase displacement of the secondary current or voltage,\nor both, due to the instrument transformer phase angles.\nPhase angle of an instrument transformer is the phase displacement, in minutes, between the primary and\nsecondary values.\n5.10.4  Secondary Burdens\nAs defined in ANSI/IEEE Std. C57.13, burden for an instrument transformer is “that property of the\ncircuit connected to the secondary winding that determines the active and reactive power at the secondary\nterminals.  The burden is expressed either as total ohms impedance with the effective resistance and\nreactive components, or as the total volt-amperes and power factor at the specified value of current or\nvoltage, and frequency.”\nThe burden on the secondary circuit of an instrument transformer affects the accuracy of the device.\nAccordingly, the burdens of the various meters and other instruments on the secondary have to be known.\nThis information is usually obtained from data sheets issued by the manufacturers.\nFor many purposes, such as when the burdens are known to be well within the rated burden capability of\nthe transformer, or when accuracy is not a concern, it is sufficient to add arithmetically the volt-ampere\nburden of the individual devices.  If the burden is expressed as an impedance value, the volt-ampere\nburden can be calculated from the relationship expressed in Equation 5-10:\nEquation 5-10\nVA = E2/Zb\nWhere:\nE=Voltage drop across the burden\nZb =Burden impedance\nFor more accurate purposes, and when the actual burdens approach the limits of the burden rating, the\ntotal burden should be determined by adding the individual burdens vectorially (taking power factors into\naccount).\n5.10.5  Construction\nAll instrument transformers have external terminals or leads to which the high-voltage or primary circuit\nand the secondary circuits are connected.  These terminals are marked to indicate the polarity of the"

The letters X, Y, Z, W, V, U are used to identify the terminals of up to six secondary\nwindings, respectively.\nIn addition to the letters, each terminal is numbered (e.g., H1, H2, X1, X2).  Letters followed by the same\nnumber are of the same polarity.\nIf multiple primary windings are provided, the H terminals are numbered with consecutive pairs of\nnumbers (H1-H2, H3-H4, etc.).  The odd-numbered terminals are of the same polarity.\nWhen taps are provided in the secondary windings, the terminals of each winding are numbered\nconsecutively (X1, X2, X3, etc.).  The lowest and highest numbered terminals indicate the full winding\nwith intermediate numbers indicating the taps.  When the X1 terminals are not in use, the lower number\nof the two terminals used is the polarity terminal.\n5.10.6  Current Transformers\nA current transformer is an instrument transformer intended to have its primary winding connected in\nseries with the conductor carrying the current to be measured or controlled.  The ratio of primary to\nsecondary current is roughly inversely proportional to the ratio of primary to secondary turns and is\nusually arranged to produce either five amperes or one ampere (IEC Standard) in the full tap of the\nsecondary winding when rated current is flowing in the primary.\nCurrent transformers can be included in two general categories:  metering service and relay service.  As a\nrule, current transformers designed for metering service should not be used for relay applications or\nsystem protection.  Likewise, current transformers designed for relay service should not be used for high-\naccuracy metering applications.\nCurrent transformers designed for relay service are fabricated with large cores, which allows the current\ntransformer to replicate the primary current during fault (high primary current) conditions.  The large core\nrequires a high exciting current, which limits the accuracy of the current transformer, especially for low\nprimary currents.\nCurrent transformers designed for metering service have smaller cores with small or negligible exciting\ncurrents, which enables the current transformer to be highly accurate at normal load currents.  However,\nthe smaller core saturates (secondary current is not a replica of the primary current) at currents slightly\nabove rated current.  A current transformer designed for metering service may not reliably operate\nprotective devices during fault conditions.\nCurrent transformers can be supplied with single-ratio, dual-ratio, or multi-ratio secondary windings. A\nmulti-ratio current transformer is one from which more than one ratio can be obtained by the use of taps\non the secondary winding.\n5.10.6.1  Types:   Various types of current transformers are available.  Figures 5-54 and 5-55 display\nseveral types of current transformers."

C or K classification means the transformer ratio can be calculated according to ANSI/IEEE\nStd. C57.13, Paragraph 8.1.10.  In other words, the true ratio of the transformer (primary\ncurrent to secondary current) can be readily determined for each application using the marked\nratio and typical excitation curves.\nb. T classification means the transformer ratio have to be determined by test.  The manufacturer\nhas to supply test data to determine performance.\nc. The secondary terminal voltage rating is the voltage that the transformer will deliver to a\nstandard burden listed in Table 5-72 at 20 times normal secondary current (and also at any\ncurrent from 1 to 20 times rated current at any lesser burden) without exceeding 10 percent\nratio error.\nFor example, relay accuracy class C400 means that the ratio can be calculated and that the ratio error will\nnot exceed 10 percent at any current from 1 to 20 times normal secondary current if the burden does not\nexceed 4.0 ohms (4.0 ohms x 5 amperes x 20 times normal current = 400 volts).\nStandard secondary terminal voltage ratings are 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 400, and 800 volts.\n5.10.6.2.6  Tapped Secondary or Multi-Ratio Current Transformer :  For current transformers with\ntapped secondaries or multi-ratio secondaries, the accuracy class applies only to the full secondary\nwinding unless specifically stated otherwise.  Performance on lower taps may be significantly reduced\nand limited.  Use of the lower taps should be avoided if possible.\n5.10.6.2.7  Continuous Thermal Current Rating Factors :  Continuous thermal current rating factors\nshall be 1.0, 1.33, 1.5, 2.0, 3.0, or 4.0, based on 30ºC ambient temperature.\n5.10.6.2.8  Short-Time Current Ratings :  Short-time current ratings (mechanical and thermal) are\ndescribed in ANSI/IEEE Std.

Figure 5-56 displays\nseveral voltage transformers.\n5.10.7.1.1  A cascade-type voltage transformer is a single high-voltage line terminal voltage\ntransformer with the primary winding distributed on several cores with the cores electromagnetically\ncoupled by coupling windings and the secondary winding on the core at the neutral end of the high-\nvoltage winding.  Each core of this type of transformer is insulated from the other cores and is maintained\nat a fixed potential with respect to ground and the line-to-ground voltage.\n5.10.7.1.2  A double-secondary voltage transformer is one that has two secondary windings on the\nsame magnetic circuit insulated from each other and the primary.  Either or both of the secondary\nwindings may be used for measurements or control.\n5.10.7.1.3  A grounded-neutral, terminal-type voltage transformer is one that has the neutral end of the\nhigh-voltage winding connected to the case or mounting base.\n5.10.7.1.4  An insulated-neutral, terminal voltage transformer is one that has the neutral end of the\nhigh-voltage winding insulated from the case or base and connected to a terminal that provides insulation\nfor a lower voltage insulation class than required for the rated insulation class of the transformer."

The devices are also useful at remote switching stations or high-voltage substations\nwhere no local distribution service is available for station service.

A CC with an electromagnetic unit is called a\nCoupling Capacitor Voltage Transformer (CCVT).  CCVTs can be used to supply voltage for metering\nand protection applications similar to a voltage transformer.\nThe ANSI Standard applicable to the power line coupling capacitors is ANSI Std. C93.1, “Power Line\nCoupling Capacitors and Coupling Capacitor Voltage Transformers (CCVT) Requirements.”  This\nstandard covers such items as definitions, service conditions, ratings, testing, and manufacturing\nrequirements.\n5.11.2  Coupling Capacitors\nCoupling capacitors are primarily used for coupling power line carrier communication equipment to a\nhigh-voltage power line.  A coupling capacitor used for power line carrier coupling is shown\nschematically in Figure 5-58.

The point between the two capacitances is tapped to provide a voltage\nproportional to the power line voltage.  The tapped connection is brought to a terminal in the base\ndesignated as the intermediate-voltage terminal.  The electromagnetic unit is connected between the\nintermediate-voltage terminal and the ground terminal.\n5.11.3.2  Transformer:   The transformer is the portion of the electromagnetic unit that provides a\nreproduction of the power line voltage at the secondary terminals of the transformer.  Transformers\ncommonly have two or more secondary windings.  Each secondary winding is typically rated 120 volts\nline-to-neutral with a tap rated 69.3 volts line-to-neutral.\n5.11.3.3  Secondary Terminals:   The secondary terminals of the voltage transformer are connected\nfor metering, protection, and control functions.  The secondary circuits are typically fused although a\ncommon practice is to not fuse critical protection circuits when reliability is the key consideration.  Some\nmanufactures provide CCVTs that are designed to withstand a secondary short circuit continuously and\ndo not require fusing; however, never intentionally short circuit the secondary of any CCVT.  Also, the\nsecondary windings of CCVTs should not be connected in a closed delta because excessive current may\ncirculate in the delta.\n5.11.3.4  Choke Coil or Blocking Impedance:   The transformer is connected to the intermediate-\nvoltage terminal through the choke coil or carrier blocking impedance.  The choke coil prevents carrier\nfrequencies from entering the electromagnetic unit.  A protective gap is provided across the choke coil to\nlimit voltage surges.\n5.11.3.5  Series Reactor:  A series reactor may be included in the electromagnetic unit to increase the\ninductive reactance of the electromagnetic unit to approximately equal the capacitive reactance of the\nCCVT at the power frequency.\n5.11.3.6  Potential Grounding Switch:   The potential grounding switch is connected between the\ncapacitor divider intermediate-voltage terminal and the ground terminal.  When closed, the potential\ngrounding switch removes the electromagnetic unit from service.  Closing the switch does not interrupt\nthe operation of the high-voltage line or the carrier equipment.  Like the carrier grounding switch, the\npotential grounding switch is located externally on the base and operated from elevation by hook stick.\n5.11.3.7  Transformer Overvoltage Protection:   Protective gaps or other means are provided to limit\novervoltages in the transformer.\nOlder CCVTs may contain additional accessories for adjusting the voltage and capacitance of the unit.\nThese accessories may be located in a separate cabinet mounted close to the base, usually on the same\nsupporting structure.  The accessories were required because, as the capacitors age, the voltage and\ncapacitance values of the CCVT drift and require periodic calibration.  Modern CCVT designs and\nmaterials have eliminated the need for these adjustments.\nDifferent manufactures may use different components and arrangements to obtain secondary voltages\nrepresentative of the power line voltage at the required accuracy.  Manufacturers may also be able to\nprovide specialty CCVTs for unusual applications."

Table 5-79 includes system voltage ratings, insulation withstand voltage\nlevels for impulse and switching surges, power frequency withstand voltages, and minimum leakage\ndistance of the capacitor porcelain.  The right-hand columns show the standard performance reference\nvoltage and marked ratios for CCVTs.\nTable 5-79 shows that standard CCs and CCVTs  are rated for line-to-ground service and possess full\nBILs for each nominal system voltage level.  The full BIL is used partly due to standardization but also in\nrecognition of the fact that these devices are usually located at line terminations and thus are more\nexposed to incoming power line surges."

These units may be readily moved from one location to another by a tractor or\nlocomotive.  Mobile units are used to provide supplementary service during seasonal and temporary load\nconditions and as spares for existing installations during periods of outage due to equipment breakdowns\nor planned maintenance and construction.  Their use can permit a higher quality of maintenance, more\nsafely and at less cost, and reduce system investment in overall transformer capacity.\nThe actual makeup of a mobile unit will depend on factors such as the intended scope of application,\ndegree of flexibility and reliability desired, physical size and weight restrictions, safety, and economics.\nEach user will have to determine the correct blend of these factors for his system.\n5.12.1  Feasibility\nThe purchase of a mobile unit should be supported by an economic study proving this method of\nproviding service continuity to be less expensive than other methods (such as individual spare\ntransformers or looped feeder lines) that can provide comparable reliability of service.\nThe study should consider carefully the kVA capacity and voltages of the substation transformers to be\nspared by the mobile unit.  There is a practical limit to the flexibility that should be attempted in one unit.\nTwo (or more) units may be the best answer on some systems where the variety of substations is great.\nThe design of many mobile units is restricted by the opposing requirements of larger transformer\ncapacity, higher primary voltages, and highway limitations on physical size and weight.  Although it is\ngenerally desirable to obtain the maximum capacity from the transformer section of a mobile unit, it is the\ntransformer kVA that has to be limited in most cases since, for a given mobile unit, the other components\ntend to remain the same in size and weight, regardless of kVA.\nSince highway restrictions vary from state to state, it is difficult for a manufacturer to adopt a standard\ndesign for a mobile unit.  Therefore, close coordination should be exercised among the purchaser, the\ndesign engineers, and the state highway commissions.\nIn attempting to meet all the requirements desired, it is important that all necessary safety clearances\nbetween phases and phase-to-ground be maintained in accordance with Chapter 4.  Basic insulation levels\nand surge protection should be selected and coordinated in accordance with good modern practice and the\nspecific system where the mobile unit will be used (see Section 5.2, Power Transformers, and Section 5.8,\nSurge Arresters).\n5.12.2  Mobile Transformers\nThis is a transformer, usually three-phase, mounted on a trailer or semi-trailer together with cooling\nequipment such as an oil pump, heat exchanger, fans, etc.  It is intended for application in a substation as\na spare transformer in place of permanently installed transformers that may have failed or that may be\nundergoing maintenance.  Other uses include provision of extra kVA capacity during temporary heavy\nload situations.\nSwitchgear, circuit breakers, or reclosers may or may not be included.  It is recommended, however, that\nboth high- and low-voltage surge arresters be mounted either on the transformer or on the trailer since the\ntransformer, when in use, may be too far from the substation arresters to be protected adequately."

    "content": "Bulletin 1724E-300\nPage 410\nThe availability of a mobile three-phase transformer as a spare permits a saving in the purchase of\nsubstation transformers.  Instead of buying four single-phase transformers in order to have a spare in each\nsubstation, a power system can save a substantial part of this cost by buying one three-phase transformer\nand depending on the mobile unit for a spare.  Because of the much higher cost of the mobile unit, this\nsaving can be realized only if the system operates several substations having approximately the same\nkVA size and compatible voltage requirements.\n5.12.3  Mobile Substations\nA mobile substation may include, in addition to the transformer, air switches, surge arresters, high-voltage\nfuses, reclosers or breakers, voltage regulating equipment, control power and instrument transformers,\nmeters and relays, and a control cabinet and various accessories to permit it to operate as a complete\nsubstation independent of any permanent ground-mounted equipment.  Thus, it can be used not only as a\nspare transformer but can replace an entire substation that has been damaged or can serve as a temporary\nsubstation in a new location until a permanent substation can be built.\nOne limitation of a mobile substation is the number of outgoing distribution circuits that can be provided\nconveniently.  Mobile substations can generally provide only one or two distribution circuits without an\nauxiliary switching structure or other supplementary equipment mounted on a separate trailer.\n5.12.4  Phase Rotation Indicators\nThree-phase units should be equipped with suitable phase rotation indicators or relays to ensure that\npower supplied to distribution circuits has the same phase rotation as that supplied from the permanent\nsubstation.  Relays should also be provided to prevent reverse rotation of the fan and pump motors.\nReversing switches should be added to these motors so that they can adapt to the phase rotation of the\npower supply.\n5.12.5  Other Considerations\n5.12.5.1  Impedance:  To reduce size and weight, the transformers in mobile units are usually\ndesigned for forced-cooled operation with higher impedances based on the forced-cooled kVA rating than\nare normal for most self-cooled power transformers.  These impedances sometimes are as high as 12 to\n15 percent.  This usually makes it impractical to continuously operate a mobile unit in parallel with a\nground-mounted unit unless a sacrifice in total kVA available from the paralleled units is acceptable.\nA general rule is that, for proper division of load, the impedances of transformers connected in parallel\nshould be as close as possible and in no case differ by more than 7.5 percent. (For example, consider a\ntransformer with a nameplate impedance of 7 percent.  The allowable variation of impedance in a\nparalleled unit is 7.5 percent of the nameplate impedance or 0.525 percent.  The paralleled transformer,\ntherefore, should have an impedance between 6.475 percent and 7.525 percent.)  If this limitation is not\nobserved, the transformers will not divide the load proportionately, so the transformer having the lower\nimpedance (on a common base) may be seriously overloaded.  The higher characteristic impedance of\nmobile units on a forced-cooled base also causes a greater voltage drop under load and places a heavier\nduty on voltage regulating equipment.\nTemporarily paralleling the mobile unit with the ground-mounted unit should be acceptable.\nConsideration should be given to the risk involved due to increased short-circuit levels.  Equipment\nratings should be checked to ensure safe operation."

Several features are desirable in the cooling system to reduce\noperating difficulties and to facilitate maintenance and repair:\n5.12.5.2.1  Valves :  Valves should be installed in the oil piping between the heat exchanger and the\ntransformer tank.  These allow maintenance of the forced oil cooling equipment without drawing down oil\nin the transformer tank.\n5.12.5.2.2  Relay :  A flow-type relay should be installed in the forced oil system to sound an alarm or\ntrip the breaker if oil circulation is blocked.  If oil circulation or cooling is lost, a mobile unit has no load-\ncarrying capability and it can remain energized only for a few hours without load before excessive\noverheating would occur.\nFan and pump motors should have individual disconnecting switches to expedite fault location.\n5.12.5.2.3  Oil Piping :  The oil piping should preferably have welded joints and flange connections.\nThreaded connections are not recommended for mobile units because of possible loosening during\ntransport.\n5.12.5.3  Primary and Secondary Connections:  Connections from mobile units to permanent\nsubstations or to overhead lines should be as short as possible.  Insulated cables of the shielded type may\nbe used where connections are quite long or exposed enough so that bare conductors may be a hazard.\nCables should be equipped with suitable terminations (stress cones, potheads) at each end.  Because of the\nexpense of higher voltage (69 kV and above) cable and terminations, it is especially desirable that the\nprimary connections be short so that bare vertical jumpers can be used safely.  The ease with which\nconnections can be made is a major factor in determining the speed with which a mobile unit may be put\ninto service.  It may be desirable to store at the substation any large pieces of equipment required to\ncomplete the installation, such as temporary wood poles, insulators, etc.\n5.12.5.4  Alarm Connections:   The mobile unit’s alarm circuits should be temporarily connected to\nthe substation alarm bus.  Alarm indications should be considered for such items as hot oil temperature,\nlow oil level, high combustible gas content, breaker lockout, security gate open or unlocked, and any\nother important indications of abnormal conditions.\n5.12.5.5  Safety Considerations:   A mobile unit has to always be considered as live and dangerous\nwhen in an operating position.  Great care should be exercised in grounding the trailer and neutrals.\nEffective barriers around and under live parts should be provided wherever necessary.  Interlocks should\nbe considered to prevent energizing the unit if any required barriers are not properly in place.\nAdditionally, a fence should be constructed around the entire mobile unit unless its operating position lies\ninside the substation’s security fence.\nBecause of the different application of mobile units as compared to regular substation components, it is\noften acceptable to consider the mobile unit as a tool that is to some extent expendable.  This approach\nwill permit reasonable deviation from strict application of many major, basic electrical properties."

Other optimal application considerations may\nbe found through discussions with suppliers of mobile units.  As mentioned earlier, minimum safety\nrequirements should not be sacrificed to obtain other advantages.\n5.12.5.6  Protection:   In designing the protection for a mobile unit, consideration should be given to\ntwo factors that distinguish it from the normal substation situation:\n1. A mobile unit is much more expensive.\n2. The temporary nature and perhaps hurried installation may increase the probability of a fault.\nBoth factors may dictate a better than normal protection scheme.\n5.12.5.7  Installation Requirements of Mobile Units:  Chapter 4, Physical Layout, discusses many of\nthe considerations for installation of mobile units at the substation.\n5.12.6  Accessories Included with the Mobile Unit\nAll accessories necessary for proper operation of the mobile unit should be placed at convenient locations\non the trailer.  Accessories that are readily available at the locations where the unit is expected to be used\nmay be omitted.  Determining which accessories to mount on board will require a careful study of all sites\nas well as space availability on the trailer.\nTypes of accessories to be considered include power cable and connectors, grounding cables and\nconnectors, power supply transformers, control batteries, heaters, lights, plug outlets, spare fuses, fencing,\nand special equipment or tools for mobile unit components and the trailer."

The engineer should\ntake advantage of the natural drainage and topographical features in the design consistent with the\nelectrical layout since coordination of the two is essential.\n6.2 TYPES OF GRADED YARDS\nThere are generally three basic profiles for substation yards:\n1. Flat—most prevalent (Figure 6-l)\n2. Sloped—occasionally required (Figure 6-2)\n3. Stepped—seldom required (Figure 6-3)\nFigure 6-1:  Flat Yard\nFigure 6-2:  Sloped Yard on Moderately Sloped Site"

It permits\nuniformity in foundation elevations and structure heights. Unless there are property restrictions, severe\ntopographical features, subterranean rock, or other considerations dictate otherwise, the yard should be\ngraded nominally flat.  (See Section 6.4, Drainage Considerations.)\n6.2.2  Sloped Yards\nOccasionally, property restrictions or economic considerations will outweigh the desirability for a flat\nyard, and a continuously sloping yard may be advantageous.\n6.2.3  Stepped Yards (Two or More Levels)\nStepped yards are usually created by extreme property restrictions, adverse mountainous terrain, or\nunderlying rock formations making excavation uneconomical.\nModification of any of the three types may be necessary to arrive at the optimum yard design.  Sloped and\nstepped sites entail extra design considerations and close coordination with the electrical layout.  There\nmay be more structures required and variable foundation elevations.\n6.3 PRELIMINARY REQUIREMENTS\nThe following lists some of the basic information required for the site preparation design for a substation\nyard:\na. Area maps (aerial photos if available)\nb. Topographic drawing of immediate area showing:\n 1. Ground elevations on a grid system at 15m (50-foot) spacing\n 2.

Soil borings in immediate site area\n6.4 DRAINAGE CONSIDERATIONS\n6.4.1  Stormwater Management\nReview state and local government regulations for stormwater management requirements.  Many local\ngovernments have adopted storm drainage criteria and require that stormwater detention or retention\nbasins be provided, and a few require zero discharge from the site.\n6.4.2  Surface Drainage System\nGenerally all three profiles lend themselves to a surface runoff system.  Such a system consists of a gently\nsloping (0.5 percent to 0.75 percent) ground surface so that the water drains to the edge of the yard or to\nshallow ditches within the yard. The ditches may discharge into culverts or shallow open channels\nremoving the runoff from the yard.\n6.4.3  Closed Drainage System\nA closed drainage system is a network of catch basins and storm sewer pipe that provides a more positive\nmeans of yard drainage.  This type of system is quite costly.  Circumstances other than economics,\nhowever, may require the use of this system.  Rural substations will rarely require a closed drainage\nsystem.\n6.4.4  Planning\nThe yard surface drainage has to be coordinated with the location of cable trenches and roads within the\nyard. The yard profile (flat, sloped, or stepped) may present varying drainage design considerations.\nCareful review of the quantity, quality, and particularly the location of the discharge water from the yard\nis emphasized.  Planning the initial drainage system for a future substation addition is sometimes\nrequired.  Generally a good rule to follow is do not discharge any more water into an existing drainage\narea outlet than what originally occurred. Small interceptor ditches strategically located will prevent\nerosion of slopes or embankments.\n6.4.5  Design\nWhenever it is necessary to calculate the amount of rainfall runoff for the design of culverts, storm sewer\npipes, detention or retention ponds, or ditches, a widely used and accepted method is the “Rational\nMethod.”  The Rational Method is not recommended for drainage areas much larger than 100 to 200\nacres.\nThe Rational Method formula is expressed by Equation 6-1:"

Water in ditches, however, should be allowed to flow approximately 0.5m/s (1 or 2 ft/s) in\nunprotected ditches and up to a maximum of about l.5m/s (5 ft/s) in sodded channels before erosion\noccurs.  Special erosion protection at open discharge ends of storm sewers and both ends of culverts\nshould be made.  Flared end sections and riprap or concrete headwalls should be specified to protect these\nareas from scour and erosion.\n6.5 EARTHWORK CONSIDERATIONS AND DESIGN\nThe computation of earthwork quantities is usually the first step in establishing the nominal rough grade\nelevation of the yard.\nClearing and grubbing of the site is required, and all vegetation should be removed and properly disposed\nof.  Generally, the topsoil in the substation area is removed and stockpiled for future use in areas requiring\nseeding.\nCAUTION:   When there may be a question of determining what consists of topsoil material, the engineer\nshould define the limits of topsoil stripping as specifically as possible.\n6.5.1  Borrow\nWhen the natural grade of the proposed site is essentially flat, it may be necessary to bring in fill material\n(borrow) to improve the drainage condition of the yard.  However, the engineer should avoid the use of\nborrow in the site design if possible.\nThe borrow material should consist of a satisfactory soil free from sod, stumps, roots, large rocks, or other\nperishable or deleterious matter.  It should be capable of forming a stable embankment when compacted\nin accordance with the requirements of this section.  Acceptable soils for borrow as identified by the\nUnified Soil Classification System are GW, GP, GM, GC, SW, SP, SM, and SC (see Table 6-2).\nThe borrow pit should be located on the property if possible.  If the borrow pit is located a remote\ndistance from the site, the engineer should reevaluate the site design to avoid hauling borrow long\ndistances.\n6.5.2  Topsoil\nRemoving topsoil on flat natural sites increases the borrow or fill requirements.  Conditions when it\nwould be excessively uneconomical to remove all the topsoil might be:\na. Excessive depth of topsoil - 0.5 m (18\") and deeper\nb. When borrow material has to be hauled long distances\nThe engineer should evaluate alternatives to stripping the topsoil in such circumstances.\nOne alternative when conditions do not seem favorable for removing topsoil is to uniformly mix the\ntopsoil with the underlying soil.  The mixture is very often suitable for embankments up to 1 meter\n(3 feet)."

    "content": "Bulletin 1724E-300\nPage 421\nThe mixture may also be compacted in place and serve as a non-bearing base upon which to build the\nembankment.  The engineer should make certain that the soil to be mixed with the topsoil is\npredominantly granular soil.  Silts or clays would not be suitable.  The mixture should consist of one or\nmore parts of good soil to one part of topsoil.\nWhen alternatives to topsoil removal are considered, the foundation design should take into account the\ndepth at which the soil conditions have been altered.\n6.5.3  Cut and Fill\nOn other than flat natural grade conditions, the nominal elevation of the yard is usually determined from a\nbalance between the required earth “fill” for the embankment and the available earth that has to be\nexcavated or “cut” from the higher areas of the site.  All cut-and-fill slopes should be one vertical to four\nhorizontal if possible.\nThere are several software programs available with which the engineer can input digitized topography and\nroadway templates and the programs will output earthwork quantities.\nThe computer software programs contain a digital terrain model (DTM), which is a graphical\nrepresentation of the topography of the site.  The DTM is created from using a triangulated irregular\nnetwork (TIN) model of points from the site survey.  Changing the surface terrain is simulated by\nbuilding new surfaces to create the final grade and merging them with the existing terrain into the revised\nsite representation.  The software program then compares the two surfaces to compute the earthwork\nvolumes.\nCut and fill quantities can also be computed by the “average end area method,” which is explained in\nmost surveying books.  Briefly, the method consists of drawing cross sections taken every 15 meters\n(50 feet) or 30 meters (100 feet).  The areas of cut and fill are determined from the computed sections\nwith a planimeter.  The sections are usually drawn with a vertical scale exaggeration of ten times the\nhorizontal scale.  The sections show both the existing profile and the proposed profile.\nTo compute the earthwork, the “cut” and “fill” areas of each section are totaled separately and added to\nthe “cut” and “fill” quantities of the adjacent section.\nThe average of the cut summation and the average of the fill summation for each pair of adjacent sections\nare multiplied by the distance between sections to obtain the volumes of cut and fill.  This procedure is\nfollowed at each section plotted across the substation yard.\nUsually several adjustments to the proposed elevation are necessary to balance the earthwork.  Only 80 to\n85 percent of cut volume, as previously computed, is assumed to be available for fill.  The 15 to\n20 percent reduction allows for losses due to compaction, spillage, and unsuit able material.\n6.5.4  Compaction\nAdequate compaction during placement of the fill is necessary to develop the required soil bearing\ncapacity and lateral resistance for the foundation design.  It is necessary also to prevent settlement due to\nconsolidation of the embankment, which may result in ponding, broken ducts, conduits, cable trenches,\netc.  All fill areas should be compacted in 200 mm (8-inch) layers to 95 percent of the maximum density\nobtained by AASHTO Std. T180.  The base upon which the embankment is constructed should also be\nloosened and compacted."

Borrow pits should be graded to a\nsmoothly contoured shape.  It may be necessary to provide seeding mulching to such areas.\n6.6 ROADS AND OTHER ACCESS\n6.6.1  General Access Roads\nAccess roads into substation yards have to be adequate to sustain heavy equipment under all weather\nconditions. Long access roads require design considerations similar to most secondary county or state\nroads.  Any culverts or sewer crossings also need to be designed for anticipated heavy equipment loads.\n6.6.2  Grade\nThe maximum grade on the access road should generally not exceed 7 percent so that heavy transformers\nmay be transported to and from the yard by normal movers without problems.  Ten percent grades may be\ntolerated for short distances of 60 to l00 meters (200 to 300 feet).\n6.6.3  Curvature\nThe inside radius of the access road at 90 degree intersections with major roads should not be less than\n15 meters (50 feet) in order to provide sufficient turning space for long vehicles.  Smaller radii may be\nadequate for substations below 230 kV.\n6.6.4  Design\nWhere space allows, access roads should be about 6 meters (20 feet) wide.  The road should be crowned\nat the center for drainage.\nThe subgrade for the road should be prepared and compacted to the same requirements as the\nembankment for the yard.\nThe wearing course for access roads in substations up to 69 kV may consist of a 200 mm (8-inch) deep\naggregate base course.  State highway department standard specifications usually contain several different\ntypes of base course material.\nFor larger substations, the access road may consist of a 200 mm (8-inch) aggregate base course and a\n100 mm (4-inch) aggregate surface course.  Highway standard specifications include several types and\nspecify the related material and gradation requirements for the base and surface course material.\nApplication of the wearing courses should be made in accordance with highway standard specifications.\n6.6.5  Railroad Spur\nRailroad spurs may be economically feasible at some substation locations.  Coordination with the\nresponsible railroad company will usually determine the requirements for making the turnout.  Often the\nrailroad company will insist on installing the track for a specified length from the main line.  Normally,"

The\ncompaction requirements used for the yard embankment are adequate for the spur track subgrade.\n6.6.6  Roadways in the Substation Yard\nMany substations do not have any specific drives or roads within the fenced yard.  The entire yard is\nconsidered as driveable by light traffic.\nIf it is desirable to have specific drives within the fenced yard for access to transformer banks or as a\nperimeter drive, the wearing surface can be the same as for the access road.  The width may be reduced to\n5 meters (16 feet) or even less.  Inside radii for interior drives may be 7.5 meters (25 feet) or less as space\nallows.  Culverts and cable trenches should also be designed for anticipated heavy equipment loads.\n6.7 EROSION PROTECTION\n6.7.1  General\nAll cut and fill slopes, ditches, and all other areas outside the fenced yard from which topsoil or\nvegetation was removed should be protected from wind and water erosion.\nIn most cases the placement of  topsoil, fertilizer, mulch, and seed are sufficient and economical for\nerosion protection.  Topsoil should be placed about 100 mm (4 inches) thick.  Consult the local\nagricultural extension office or the highway department for appropriate types and application rates of\nfertilizer and seed.\nSlopes greater than 1 vertical to 2 ½ horizontal may require sodding.  The engineer should attempt to keep\nslopes at 1 vertical to 4 horizontal for erosion and maintenance purposes.\nRiprap should be used at corners and intersections of ditches where erosion is likely.\n6.7.2  Legal Requirements\nBecause of the large amount of land under construction each year, erosion and sedimentation control\nduring construction have become a problem.  Many states and localities now have laws or ordinances to\ncontrol soil erosion on construction sites and the sedimentation of adjoining waterways.\nThe engineer should become aware of such state laws, which are usually enforced by the counties.  Many\ncounties have extensive guidelines that have to be strictly adhered to.  Consult county agricultural\nextension offices for these requirements.\nThe soil erosion and sedimentation control statutes may mean considerably more engineering time to\ndevelop drawings to show compliance with the requirements of the statute.\n6.8 YARD SURFACING MATERIAL\nIt is desirable to have 100 to 150 mm (4 to 6 inches) of crushed stone or rock cover the entire substation\nyard and to extend 1 meter (3 feet) beyond the substation fence.  In some locations clam and oyster shell\nmay also be used.  The yard surface material helps reduce the danger of potentially hazardous mesh and"

A 75 mm (3-inch)\nlayer of crushed stone or rock may then be placed on top.  In areas where clam and oyster shell is\navailable, a very durable drive surface is easily obtained.\nThe size of stone for yard surfacing material should generally vary between 10 mm and 25 mm (3/8 to\n1 inch) with the percentage f iner than 10 mm (3/8 inch) limited to 5 to 10 percent.  Usually the state\nhighway department has gradations in this range.  All faces of yard surface material should be crushed.\nUse of round rock (river rock) is to be avoided due to rutting problems.\nThe material selected for yard surfacing may be affected by the electrical grounding design  (see Chap-\nter 9, Grounding, for details).  Because of electrical fault currents, surfacing material may need to be\nspecified differently than would otherwise be the case.  It may be desirable to have a 100 to 150 mm (4-\nto 6-inch) layer of crushed rock as coarse as can reasonably be walked on with as few fines as practical or\nnominally available.\nBefore the yard surfacing material is installed, the yard surface should be brought to its proposed\nelevations and rolled to a reasonably firm condition.  A soil sterilizer may be applied to prevent the\ngrowth of grass and weeds at this time.  The yard stone or shell should then be spread as evenly as\npractical but need not be rolled.  This work should not begin until all substation work is essentially\ncompleted.\n6.9 SECURITY FENCE\nGenerally, all outdoor substations are enclosed by a security fence, as discussed in Chapter 2.  Safety\nclearance requirements for substation fences are covered in Chapter 4.\nThe fence should be installed as soon as practicable after the site work is completed.  This work is usually\ndone by a fence contractor and is not necessarily a part of the general contract.\nA typical specification for material and installation of a chain-link security fence is found in the\nAppendix C to this chapter.  Bear in mind that numerous other rail, post, and gate frame component\ndesigns will serve at least equally as well as those noted in the typical specification.\n6.10 REFERENCES\nAASHTO Std.

The guide is a joint\neffort of utilities, manufacturers, consulting firms, and academic research groups.  The guide is currently\nin rough draft form and is being reviewed by the groups involved.\n7.1 MATERIALS\nThere are four basic materials used for substation structures: steel, aluminum, concrete, and wood.\n7.1.1  Steel\nSteel is used for most substation structures.  Its availability and good structural characteristics generally\nmake it economically attractive.  Steel, however, has to have adequate protection from the elements to\nprevent corrosion.  Galvanizing and painting are two widely used finishes for steel substation structures.\nBecause of the protective finish, steel substation structures should not be designed for field welding or\nfield drilling for connections.  Field welding is generally uneconomical and usually requires close control\nover the welding conditions.\nASTM A36 steel is the standard grade of steel used for most rolled-shape members in structural design.\nMember stresses are usually low, and weight saving is of little advantage.  However, should large loads\nbe encountered, coupled with the need for weight reduction, a high-strength steel should be considered.\nStructures requiring such consideration are the line support structures.  Structural steel pipe and square\ntube sections are normally constructed of ASTM A53 Grade B and ASTM A501 steel, respectively.\n7.1.2  Aluminum\nAluminum is sometimes used for substation structures where good corrosion-resistant properties are\ndesired.  It is about one-third the weight of steel.\nIf aluminum is used, member types should be selected taking advantage of the optimum structural\nqualities of aluminum and avoiding the shapes in which aluminum members may be a problem.\nDeflection and torsion has to be carefully reviewed when selecting member types in aluminum.\nAluminum has a lower modulus of elasticity, E = 6.9 x 106 N/cm2  (10 x 106 psi), and modulus of\nelasticity in shear, E = 2.6 x 106 N/cm2  (3.8 x 106 psi), than steel, E s = 20 x 106 N/cm2 and E s = 8.3 x 106"

These properties are directly related to deflection and torsional\nrotation.\nStructures designed for aluminum are constructed of Alloy 6061-T6 and should be designed, fabricated,\nand erected in accordance with the Aluminum Association’s Specifications for Aluminum Structures .\n7.1.3  Concrete\nPrecast, prestressed concrete substation structures may be economical in coastal areas with high winds\nand a corrosive environment, and also when substations are located near the fabricator’s plant.  Special\nconsiderations are required for the foundation, erection, handling, and equipment mounting characteristics\nof the structure.\n7.1.4  Wood\nWood may be used for substation structures.   Members have to be treated with an appropriate\npreservative.  Wood poles and members are usually readily available.  Structural properties and size\ntolerances of wood are somewhat variable, and design considerations should take this into account.  The\nlife of a wood structure is shorter than for steel, aluminum, or concrete, and maintenance costs may be\nhigher.\nEconomics is an important consideration when making a material and member type selection.  The total\ncost over the life of the structure should be considered.  This also includes the cost of fabrication and\nshipping, ease of erection, and cost of maintenance.\n7.2 FUNCTIONAL STRUCTURE TYPES\nThere are essentially three types of substation structures as categorized from a structural design approach\nrelated to the function served in the substation.\n7.2.1  Line Support Structures\nThese structures are used as line exit structures, internal strain bus structures, and line terminating\nstructures.  They consist basically of two high towers and a crossarm on which the line conductors are\nattached.  They may be used as single-bay or multibay structures.\nThe major forces acting on these structures are the shield wire and conductor tensions and wind forces.\nBecause of their large size and the magnitude of forces acting on them, these structures are usually highly\nstressed and require the most design effort.\n7.2.2  Equipment Support Structures\nThese structures are commonly referred to as bus support structures, switch stands, lightning arrester\nstands, line trap supports, etc.\nIn low-profile substation design, these structures are designed primarily as vertical cantilever beams with\nwind and short-circuit forces being the primary design forces.  Deflection may control the design size of\nsome structures and should be reviewed in all structures."

    "content": "Bulletin 1724E-300\nPage 433\nSwitch stands should be designed to be more rigid than bus supports or other structures because of the\ndynamic loading effect of the switch blade operation and the requirement that the switch blade has to\nalways return (close) to the relatively small space of the saddle.  Any appreciable twisting or deflection of\nthe switch stand may prohibit this function.\n7.2.3  Distribution Substation Structure\nThis structure is the column and beam structure, similar to a building frame.  It may consist of one or\nseveral bays in length and usually is one bay wide.  It may vary in height from 6 to 12 m (20 to 40 feet) or\nmore.\nThe structure supports switches and other equipment.  It usually will have line conductors attached to one\nor more sides.  This structure should be designed for rigidity and flexibility in equipment location.\nGenerally these structures are composed of box truss members.\n7.3 STRUCTURE MEMBER TYPES\nThree types of structure profile configurations are common in substations today.  They are classified from\ntheir general physical appearance and structural member components.  The types are lattice, solid profile,\nand semi-solid profile.\n7.3.1  Lattice\nThe lattice structure consists primarily of angle members forming the chords and lacing of a box truss\nacting as a beam or column.\nDepending on the function of the structure (i.e., bus support stand vs. line support structure), the design of\nthe members may or may not be time-consuming and complex.\nThe lattice structure has been widely used for substation structures for many years.  Its box truss beams\nand columns allow for an efficient use of material.  Usually the lattice structure results in the least\nstructure weight compared to other line support structures.  It is also very stable and rigid.  It is very easy\nto fabricate, galvanize, and ship.  It requires a large amount of bolting and erection time in the field,\nunless the members are shipped preassembled, and maintenance painting, if required, is costly.  Lattice\nstructures are also aesthetically displeasing.\n7.3.2  Solid Profile\nThe solid-profile structure is made from wide flange shapes, pipes, tapered round or polygonal shapes,\nand rectangular tube shapes.  The aesthetic appearance, relatively short erection time, and ease of\nmaintenance make the solid-profile structure a popular choice for equipment support structures.  The\nweight penalty on solid-profile equipment support structures is smaller than on line support structures.\nThe square tube has good torsional resistance and is equal structurally about either major axis.  The wide\nflange shape has a minor axis that may control the design.  It has an open cross section and minimal\nresistance to torsional loads.\nWide flange shapes are more suitable for bolted structural connections and may require less welding\nduring fabrication."

The tower\nmay be either an A-frame configuration or a single pole.  Wide flange shapes may be used in the A-frame\ntower.  Crossarms are made of straight or tapered round or polygonal members.  A combined section from\nwide flange shapes is used for crossarms also.\nTapered poles may have telescoping or flanged splice connections when the pole is galvanized.  Painted\npoles may have welded splice joints and are hermetically sealed to prevent oxidation inside the pole.\nTapered poles are almost always designed by the pole fabricator to the loading requirements specified by\nthe engineer.\n7.3.3  Semi-Solid Profile\nThe third structure type is semi-solid profile.  This type of structure is made from wide flanges and pipes\nor tubes that form the major members, and is braced between these major members with angle bracing.\nThe design of this structure type is similar to the lattice structure and is very stable and rigid because of\nthe bracing.\n7.3.4  Summary\nEach of the structure member types has its advantages and disadvantages, both from an economical and\ndesign viewpoint.\nLattice structures are usually economically comparable in aluminum and steel.  The basic design\napproach is also the same.  Solid-profile structures used for equipment support structures in aluminum\nmay be as economical as steel in favorable geographical locations.  Design effort for aluminum members\nused in equipment support structures requires more time because of buckling characteristics and weld\neffect on allowable stresses.  However, the desirability of aluminum’s good weathering characteristics\nand light weight are positive factors that have to also be evaluated.\n7.4 DESIGN\n7.4.1  Design Loads\nDesign loads for substation structures should be categorized by:\n1. Line support structures\n2. Equipment support structures\n7.4.2  Line Support Structures\nThe design loading criteria for these structures should be very similar to the criteria for a transmission line\ntower.  The maximum loading condition and line tension are usually furnished by the transmission\nengineer.  For strain bus structures the substation engineer should base the design upon those design loads\nthat will be a maximum for the various components of the structure."

The single-\npole-type line support structure has to be carefully reviewed for deflection limitations, particularly if it is\nacting as a line deadend structure and also is supporting backspan conductors.\n7.4.4  Lightning Masts\nSingle tubular poles often are used for tall lightning masts.  Give consideration to those poles where no\nshield wires are attached.\nInclude damping devices to reduce or negate vibrational forces created by the wind blowing at or near the\nnatural frequency of the pole.\nOne such device may be fairly heavy steel chain, encased in a fire hose (to protect the pole finish) and\nsuspended from the top of the pole (inside).\n7.4.5  Equipment Support Structures\nDesign these structures for all applicable wind, ice, short-circuit, and dead and dynamic operating loads of\nequipment.  Steel substation structures generally should conform to the requirements of Part 36 of NEMA\nPublication SG 6.\nIce loading is usually not the controlling design load for equipment support structures but should be\nreviewed.\nWind loads plus short-circuit forces usually produce the maximum stresses in the structures.\nAlthough not normally a critical factor on bus supports and other stationary type equipment stands,\ndeflection limitations are important for switch stands.  Follow deflection limitations as specified in\nSection SG6-36.03 of NEMA Publication SG 6 unless special conditions dictate otherwise.\nDesign bus support structures and other stationary equipment stands for a reasonable amount of rigidity.\nMembers stressed to near their allowable stresses may result in structures that perform unsatisfactorily.\nBasically, the wind load is assumed for design purposes to be a statically applied load.  In reality, it\nfluctuates in magnitude, and oscillating motion may be induced in the structures.  This motion is most\nunpredictable but can be somewhat alleviated by selecting members that may be larger than required by\nthe calculations and will provide reasonable rigidity for unknown effects.  Allowable working stress\ndesign values should be used for equipment support structures.\n7.4.6  Base Condition\nEquipment support structures consisting of solid-profile members may be designed either with the base\nplate in full contact with the foundation or resting on leveling nuts slightly above the foundation.\nThe design with the leveling nuts has several advantages:"

It allows for some flexibility for structure alignment as a result of fabrication tolerances and\nbuswork fit up.\nc. The base plate is not resting in any standing water on the foundation.\nAnchor bolt sizes may be required to be slightly larger because of additional bending stress induced.  The\nspace between the bottom of  the leveling nut and the nominal top of the foundation is usually 1.3 cm\n(½ inch).\n7.4.7  Seismic Loads\nDesigning structures for seismic loading can be a very involved, time-consuming procedure involving\ndynamic analysis and response spectra.  In certain areas of high seismic risk or when sensitive equipment\nis to be installed, such analysis may be necessary; however, it should be performed by trained, competent\npeople.  For most design purposes, more simplified methods can be used, such as those found in the\nASCE Substation Design Guide , which is currently being updated and revised.  The discussion presented\nhere is based on the 1998 draft version of the ASCE Substation Design Guide .\nSeismic or earthquake loads are environmental loads that are governed by the region of the country in\nwhich they occur.  In substation design, seismic loads are not usually combined with ice and wind loads,\nbut may be combined with short-circuit forces or operating loads if these loads can occur as a result of\nseismic activity.\nThe United States is broken into six seismic regions as shown in Figure 2-2, UBC Seismic Zone Map of\nthe United States.  A zone factor, Z, ranging from 0.0 to 0.4 is determined based on the site location.  The\nzone factor is equivalent to the zero period acceleration (ZPA) of the ground motion.  Values of “Z” are\nindicated in Table 7-1.\nTable 7-1:  UBC Seismic Zone Factors.  Ref.

ST4 Flexible Isolated Support (Supports equipment)\nRigid and flexible isolated supports (ST3 and ST4) in voltage classes greater than 121 kV, and within\nSeismic Zones 3 and 4, should be designed and qualified according to IEEE Std. 693, “Recommended\nPractices for Seismic Design of Substations.”  For these structures, the procedure below can be used as a\ncheck against wind and ice load cases to determine controlling load cases, but IEEE Std. 693 should be\nused for final design.\nThe design procedure described below can be used for the design of:"

One widely used method is found in NEMA\nStd. SG6, Part 36, “Outdoor Substations.”\nWind pressures on flat surfaces are obtained from Equations 7-3 and 7-4:\nEquation 7-3 Equation 7-4\nPw   = 0.0776V2(Metric) Pw   = 0.0042V2(English)\nWind pressures on cylindrical surfaces are obtained from Equations 7-5 and 7-6:\nEquation 7-5 Equation 7-6\nPw   = 0.0481V2(Metric) Pw   = 0.0026V2(English)\nWhere:\nPw =Pressure on the projected area, N/m2 (psf)\nV =Design wind velocity, km/hr (mph)\nThe design wind velocity for a given area is determined from the probable wind velocity over the design\nlife of the structure, say a 50-year period of recurrence.  This information can be obtained from Figure 2-1\nor may be derived from local climatological data.\nFor wind loading on lattice structures, the projected area used is one and one-half times the area of\nexposed members.\nAn alternative approach to calculating wind load on substation structures can be found in the ASCE\nSubstation Design Guide , currently under development.  The approach in this guide is based on\nANSI/ ASCE  Std. 7-95, “Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures.”\nUnder the ANSI/ASCE Std. 7-95 approach, the “3-second gust” wind speed at a height of 10 meters\n(33 feet) is used as the basic wind speed for design re placing the “fastest mile” wind speed data in the\nASCE Std. 7-93 basic wind speed map.  The basic wind speed to be used can be obtained from Fig-\nure 2.1.  Based on the ASCE Substation Design Guide  and ANSI/IEEE Std. 605 , “IEEE Guide for Design\nof Substation Rigid Bus Structures,” the wind load on a structure can be determined using Equation 7-7:"

The load combination design should be\nlimited to calculations of stress and should not consider deflection of the structure.\n7.4.11  Typical Design Approach\nThere are basically two approaches to design of steel structures: Allowable Stress Design (ASD) and\nLoad and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD).\nThe ASD approach is defined by the American Institute of Steel Construction’s (AISC) Manual of Steel\nConstruction, ASD .  In the ASD, the stresses induced by various service loads (wind, ice, etc.) in a\nselected member are compared to allowable stresses established in the AISC manual.\nIn LRFD, load factors are applied to the service loads, or loads the structure is actually expected to see.\nThen a member is selected that will have sufficient strength to resist the factored loads.  In addition, the\ntheoretical member strength is reduced by an applied resistance factor.  The selection of the member has\nto satisfy the following:\nFactored load < Factored strength\nThe “factored load” is the sum of all the working loads to be resisted by the member.  Each load is\nmultiplied by its own load factor.  Dead loads, for example, will have load factors that are different from\nlive load factors.  The “factored strength” is the theoretical strength multiplied by a resistance factor.\nLoad and Resistance Factor Design of steel structures is very much similar to the approach to reinforced\nconcrete design used for several years in the American Concrete Institute’s Building Code where it is\nknown as strength design.\nThe benefit of ASD is that it is straightforward and familiar to most structural engineers.  With the LRFD\napproach, load factors model the likelihood, or probability of certainty, of various types of loads. For\nexample, dead loads can typically be determined with more certainty than can live loads.  Therefore, the\nload factor for a dead load is less than that for a live load.\nThe resistance factors applied to the member’s theoretical strength account for uncertainties in material\nproperties, design theory, and fabrication and construction practices.  One might say that the LRFD is a\nmore realistic approach to structure design.  The guidelines and specifications for LRFD are published in\nAISC’s Manual of Steel Construction , Load Factor & Resistance Factor Design.\nSeveral examples are illustrated depicting the design of the main member for a single-phase bus support.\nThese examples show a typical approach for the design of most equipment support structures using\nallowable stress design.  The examples include a square tube, a wide flange, and a lattice column, all\ncomposed of steel.\nLighter weight members may still meet the loading and deflection criteria.  However, smaller size\nmembers may present fabrication problems in the lattice structure."

Standard washers are not normally used\nwith these bolts.\n7.6 WELDING\nAll welding of structural steel should be in accordance with the latest edition of the Structural Welding\nCode , D1.l of the American Welding Society.\nIn addition to the required design welds, structures that are to be galvanized should have all joints sealed\nwith a small continuous seal weld.  This is to help prevent corrosion or small crevices or cracks between\ntwo pieces of abutting steel that the acid bath can penetrate, but not the molten zinc. This is covered in\nASTM A385.\n7.7 FINISHES\n7.7.1  Galvanizing\nGalvanized steel has found wide application for substation structures.  Hot-dip galvanizing has been the\nmost widely used finish on steel substation structures for the following reasons:\na. It is economical (initial cost, touch-up, and general maintenance).\nb. It provides good resistance to most corrosive environments.\nc. It has “self-healing” properties against minor abrasions.\nd. It requires little or no maintenance in most substation applications.\nNew structures are galvanized in accordance with ASTM Standard Specification A123.  Safeguards\nagainst embrittlement and warpage and distortion during galvanizing should be in conformance with\nASTM Standard Specification A143 and A384, respectively.  Galvanized members that are marred in\nhandling or erection or that have had corrective work done should be touched up with a zinc-rich paint.\nAll bolts and steel hardware should be galvanized in accordance with ASTM Standard Specification A153\nfor Class C material.\n7.7.2  Painting\nWhen painted structures are desired, there are several systems available.  Consultation with reputable\npaint suppliers is recommended. Painting System Specification No. 1.04, SSPC –PS 1.04, from the Steel\nStructures Painting Council is one paint system that is applicable for galvanized and non-galvanized\nsubstation structures.  The following is a summary of the system from the seventh edition of the Steel\nStructures Painting Council’s Systems and Specifications  manual.\nSurface Preparation: The surface shall be thoroughly cleaned of all oil, grease, dirt, loose mill scale,\nand other detrimental substances.  “Hand tool cleaning” is the minimum\nsurface preparation required for this oil-based system.  Depending upon\ncondition of the surface “power tool cleaning” may be necessary.  “Solvent\ncleaning” is only required for new galvanized structures.  Specifications for\nthese cleaning systems are outlined in the SSPC manual."

This\npaint is intended for brush or spray applications and works well as either an\nintermediate or top coat.   There are four types that are color dependent:\nType 1 – white\nType 2 – medium to light gray to tan\nType 3 – light green\nType 4 – dark or forest green\nFinish Coat: Same as intermediate coat, but the color has to be specified.\nDry Film Thickness : This th ree-coat paint system calls for a minimum paint thickness of 4.5 mils.\nThis consists of a 2.0 mil primer coat, a 1.5 mil intermediate coat, and a 1.0 mil\nfinish coat.  The measurements shall be in accordance with SSPC-PA 2,\n“Measurement of Dry Paint Thickness with Magnetic Gages.”\nPainted structures should be primed and receive the intermediate coat in the shop.   The finish coat may\neither be applied in the shop or in the field.  The finish coat can be applied under ideal conditions in the\nshop; however, the structure finish may be marred during shipment or erection requiring field touch-up.\nThe SSPC manual gives additional specifications for touch-up painting and maintenance painting as well\nas providing alternative finish coat systems.\n7.7.3  Wood Preservatives\nWood preservatives for poles shall conform to that specified in RUS Bulletin 1728F-700, “Specification\nfor Wood Poles, Stubs and Anchor Logs” (Electric).\nAll other timber shall be fully treated in accordance with RUS Bulletin 1728H-701, “Specification for\nWood Crossarms (Solid and Laminated), Transmission Timbers and Pole Keys” (Electric).  Where\nframing and drilling are necessary for construction purposes, an approved preservative should be applied\nto the exposed, untreated wood.\n7.8 COMPUTER PROGRAMS\nToday, computers are widely used in the design of substation steel structures.  Though there are numerous\ndesign programs available for use on a personal computer, most of them use a basic approach.\n7.8.1  Model Geometry\nThe structure, whether a simple bus support or a more involved multi-bay switch rack, is defined by\nnodes (or joints) and by members (or elements).  The nodes are either automatically numbered by the\nprogram or are defined by the user.  Most programs accommodate a three-dimensional model, and the\nnodes are located in a Cartesian coordinate system by input of X, Y, and Z coordinates.  The members are\nthen defined and “connected.”  Member end points (node numbers) are identified, and the members are\nassigned numbers, either by the program or the user.  Material properties, such as the modulus of"

In many programs the material,\nsuch as concrete, wood, or steel, can be selected from a menu and all the properties automatically defined.\nAfter material properties are defined, section properties of the members are then input.  Section properties\ninclude cross-sectional area, moment of inertia, and torsional properties.  Most programs allow the user to\nidentify a standard AISC cross section, for example W8X31, with all the associated section properties\nbuilt into the program’s database.  After node, member, and section properties are defined, the member\nend restraints and base fixity are defined.  Members are considered “fixed,” or rigid and continuous unless\nthe end of the member is released in rotation or translation by the user.  A column base restraint is defined\non the basis of the connection details.  If it is firmly fixed with four anchor bolts with the column welded\ndirectly to the base plate, the end restraint can be defined in the model as fixed.  However, if the column\nis connected to the base plate by two anchor bolts, the end restraint can be modeled with a pinned\nconnection, or free to rotate but restrained in translation.\n7.8.2  Load Input\nLoads are applied to the structure as either point or distributed loads.  With modern structural analysis\nprograms, the point loads can be linear loads (kN) or applied moments (kN-m) in any direction anywhere\nalong the length of the member.  Distributed loads can be uniform or can vary in magnitude, and can be\napplied over all or any portion of the member.  Various load cases are defined, such as extreme wind, ice\nloads, equipment, and gravity loads, and then these separate load cases are combined along with\nappropriate load factors.\n7.8.3  Computer Output\nAfter the computer model of the structure has been created and the loads entered, the program is\nexecuted.  The output from a structural analysis program provides all the information needed by the\nengineer to completely design the structure.  The information typically includes forces at each joint (axial\nforces, shear, and bending moments) and structure reactions to be used in foundation design.  Also\nincluded are member stresses and deflections at various points along the member.  Some programs\nprovide AISC stress checks and suggested member sizes to be used in a subsequent iteration of the\nprogram.\nAs noted above, there are many structural analysis programs available on the market.  A small sample of\nthese are listed below.  Sample input and output from RISA-3D for a simple “T” structure provided for\nreference can be found in the Appendix D to this chapter.\nSAP2000\nComputers and Structures, Inc.\n1995 University Ave.\nBerkley, CA 94704\nPhone: (510) 845-2177\nSTAAD-III\nResearch Engineers\n22700 Savi Ranch\nYorba Linda, CA 92887-4608\nPhone: (714) 974-2500RISA-3D\nRISA Technologies\n26212 Dimension Drive, Suite 200\nLake Forest, CA 92630\nPhone: (800) 332-7472\nStruCAD*3D\nZentech, Inc.\n8582 Katy Freeway, Suite 205\nHouston, TX 77024\nPhone: (713) 984-9171"

The heterogeneous characteristics of soils or their localized\nvariability make foundation design a much less exacting engineering problem than structural design or\nsome facets of electrical design, but the inexactness of soil mechanics need not be a reason for\nultraconservatism and costly foundations.  Further, with the enhancements of convenient computer\nprograms, tedious repetition of design practices for foundation design has been reduced.  While this\nchapter is intended as a general guide, it cannot serve as a guarantee against foundation problems.\nA thorough knowledge of geotechnical subsurface engineering parameters is essential to providing a\nreliable and cost-effective foundation design.  Geotechnical engineering or soil analysis is beyond the\nscope of this document and generally requires the services of a geotechnical engineer to prepare site-\nspecific recommendations.  When designing foundations, it is important to address the following design\nissues:\n• The allowable load-bearing capacity of the subsurface materials\n• The allowable deformations permitted upon the structure/foundation under loading\nIn addition to site-specific borings and laboratory testing, additional data may be gathered pertinent to the\nsite through reference to state or federal geologic mapping, aerial photos, Natural Resource Conservation\nService (formerly the Soil Conservation Service) mapping, and other hydrological references.  A number\nof federal and state agencies frequently have available information that can be consulted and will provide\neither regional or localized data to supplement a site subsurface investigation.\n8.2 SOIL INFORMATION\n8.2.1  General\nA subsurface investigation should be conducted for each substation.  Temporary installations and small\ndistribution substations may only require a minimal amount of information.  At these locations augered\nprobe borings, in situ quasi-static cone penetrations (ASTM D3441), vane shear tests (ASTM D2573), or\nthe pressure meter (ASTM D4719) can be used to provide an indication of the soil’s engineering\ncharacteristics.\nSoil probes or borings should be taken primarily at critical foundations.  These normally are for line\nsupport structures (i.e., deadends) and transformers.  The number of borings may vary from three at small\nsubstations to six or ten at larger substations.  The depth of borings should be about 10 meters (30 feet)\nbelow the final grade of the substation yard, but may vary dependent upon:\n1. Intensity of structural loads\n2. Softness or wetness of subsurface soils\n3. Depth of groundwater level\nA sample specification for procurement of soil borings is included as an Appendix E to this chapter."

The description of the material noted on the soil boring log\nshould be described in accordance with the Unified Soil Classification System (ASTM D2487 and\nD2488).  (See Table 6-2 in Chapter 6.)\nMaterial described as “sandy clay” can, for example, be assumed to behave predominately as cohesive\nmaterial, whereas “clayey sand” will probably behave as granular material.  The relative quantities of\ncohesive and granular materials can appreciably affect the soil properties and cause concern.  Therefore,\nwhen in doubt, design the foundations both ways and use the most conservative design.\nTo assist with the visual classification of soil types, specific index classification tests can be performed.\nTypical index classification tests for cohesionless and cohesive soils are as follows:\nCohesionless\nGrain Size Sieve Analysis ASTM D422\nMoisture Content ASTM D2216\nSpecific Gravity ASTM D854\nCohesive\nAtterberg Limits ASTM D4318\nMoisture Content ASTM D2216\nUnit Weight ASTM D2216\nSpecific Gravity ASTM D854\nHydrometer ASTM D422\nIndex tests provide data that can frequently be correlated with other engineering characteristics of the\nsoils such as strength, swell potential, collapse potential, consolidation, and degree of compaction.\nAlthough index tests should not be viewed as a total replacement to undisturbed engineering tests, they\nfrequently can be used to supplement an investigation program and confirm either consistency or\nvariability at site.\nSpecific references are available in research that relate index properties to engineering properties; these\nshould be reviewed by an individual familiar with geotechnical engineering design who understands their\nlimitations and appropriateness for use.  Typically, it is not recommended to simply utilize presumptive\nengineering properties from tables or texts that rely on standard penetration tests, visual classifications,\nand limited index tests alone, particularly for cohesive soils where greater variability in strength and\ndeformation may occur locally.  Presumptive values for allowable bearing pressures on soil or rock\nshould be used only as a means of guidance or for preliminary or temporary design.  Further, the degree\nof disturbance to soil samples, whether standard penetration test samples or relatively undisturbed\nsamples, have to be kept to a minimum prior to laboratory testing through the use of appropriate drilling,\nsampling, and transportation methods.\n8.2.3  Bearing Values\nBearing values or engineering parameters developed from laboratory tests upon cohesive soils should be\nobtained from relatively undisturbed samples in accordance with “Practice for Thin-Walled Tube"

The parameter obtained is usually the internal friction angle ( φ).\nUnconfined compressive strengths for cohesive or clay-like soils are best determined using “Test Method\nfor Unconfined Compressive Strength of Soil” (ASTM D2166), although rough correlations relative to\nstandard penetration tests have been developed.\nIn situ strengths derived from the quasi-static cone penetrometer (ASTM D3441), vane shear\n(ASTM  D2573), or pressuremeter (ASTM D4719) are frequently more reliable, particularly in very soft\nsoils, because of their minimization of sample disturbance and testing of the soils in place.\nRock coring to obtain sample recovery, Rock Quality Designation (RQD), and unconfined strengths may\nbe required for sites with anticipated rock formations.  It is also important to be familiar with local\nengineering characteristics of not only the individual rock formations present, but also their global or rock\nmass properties.  Give special design consideration to swelling shales, steeply dipping rock, highly\nweathered or decomposed rock units, fractured or jointed rock, or clay or bentonite seamed rock units.\nThese conditions may impact both the strength and deformation performance of structures founded in or\nupon rock.\n8.2.4  Groundwater Level\nThe elevation of the groundwater level is important in foundation design for several reasons.  Open-cut\nexcavations below it within permeable stratas require dewatering and increased costs.  The water level\nalso has considerable influence on the bearing capacity and total settlement in granular soils.  The bearing\ncapacity of a spread footing in granular soil is derived from the density of the soil below the footing and\nthe density of the soil surrounding the footing (backfill or surcharge).  A rise of the water level above a\ndepth greater than the width of the footing up to the top of the surcharge in effect reduces the effective\noverburden pressures within the sand to roughly half their original values, and further reduces the\nstiffness or strain carrying capacity of the granular soils.  Therefore, the footing pressure that is expected\nto produce a 1-inch total settlement when the water level is at the surface is only about half that required\nto produce a 1-inch total settlement when the water level is at or below a depth equal to the footing width\nbelow the base of the footing.\nThe effect of the water level is to reduce the effective overburden pressure or density of the granular soil\nbecause of buoyancy.  The submerged density of granular soil is about half of the moist or dry density.  If\nthe water level is at or exceeds a depth equal to the footing width below the base of the footing, the\nbearing capacity is not affected.  If the water level is at the bottom of the footing or may rise to the ground\nsurface, the portion of bearing capacity obtained by the density of soil below the footing is reduced in\nhalf.  If the water level is at the top of the backfill, the portion of bearing capacity obtained by the density\nof the surcharge is also reduced in half.\n8.2.5  Differential Settlement\nMinor differential settlement between foundations in substations is generally acceptable.  However, there\nare certain soils and conditions that have to be carefully reviewed and avoided if possible.  Silts and silty\nsands are usually problem soils, both from strength relationships and degree of compaction.  Carefully\nexamine weak strata of soil under a thin layer of dense or good soil and take them into consideration\nregarding settlement.  Organic or swamp-like soils, or uncompacted fills, pose a risk to differential long-"

Soils that may expand, collapse, or disperse upon wetting require special\nattention for design by a geotechnical engineer.\n8.2.6  Chemical Tests\nSoils may impact foundations and other buried systems as a result of chemical attack on concrete,\ncorrosion of steel, and other detrimental weathering.  Consult a corrosion specialist or engineer familiar\nwith these chemical tests to determine the appropriate cement type based on prevailing soluable sulfate\nand chloride ion concentrations within the soil or groundwater.  Resistivity of the soil, pH, sulfides,\nRedox readings, and nitrates may also have detrimental effects on concrete, steel, or grounded structures.\nThese conditions require localized testing and design.\n8.2.7  Seismic Evaluation\nSeismic evaluation of substation sites is currently beyond the scope of this document, but should be\nreviewed locally by a geotechnical engineer, and geologist, where required.  Delineating the location of\nfaults and surface disruptions, and the potential for sand boils, soil flows, slope slides, and liquefiable\nsoils, is essential to designing foundations that remain stable under extreme seismic events.  If\nliquefaction is determined to be likely at a site under certain seismic events, then design of the\nfoundations to extend beyond such zones or mitigation measures to improve the soils will need to be\npursued in final design.  Hand calculation techniques or commercially available computer programs\nperformed by a geotechnical engineer can evaluate liquefaction potential, based on probable earthquake\ncriteria.\n8.3 FOUNDATION TYPES\nThe various types of foundations for substation structures and equipment include drilled shafts (augered\npiers), spread footings, piles, slabs on grade, rock anchors, and direct embedment for wood or concrete\npoles.\n8.3.1  Drilled Shafts (Piers)\nThe drilled shaft is constructed by augering, drilling, or coring a hole in the ground, placing reinforcing\nsteel, and filling with concrete.  The anchor bolts may be cast in the shaft at this time or set in a cap\nconstructed at some later time.  Drilled shaft construction and design has been developed and researched\nby the Association of Drilled Shaft Contractors (ADSC) and the American Concrete Institute (ACI), each\nof which has developed typical standard specifications for their construction.  Further, design and\nconstruction procedures are documented through extensive research on behalf of the Federal Highway\nAdministration (FHWA), U.S. Department of Transportation, in the Drilled Shaft Manual  (Publication\nNo. FHWA Implementation Package 77-21) and Drilled Shafts  (Publication No. FHWA-HI-88-042).\nWhen there is a sufficient quantity of foundations, the drilled shaft foundations are usually more\neconomical than other types because of the “assembly line” installation procedure.  Drilled shafts are\nmost economical when soil conditions are not wet and sandy, although, with care and quality control\noversight during construction, casings, bentonite slurries, and polymer muds are currently available to\npromote their construction.\nIf wet and sandy soil is below a level where a spread footing would bear, the spread footing should be\nevaluated and may be selected.  However, if wet and sandy conditions also exist above the spread footing\nlevel, consider the drilled shaft, allowing extra costs for encasement.  This design may be more"

Uplift and compressive forces are\nalso adequately resisted by drilled shafts.  Where soils permit belling of the shaft, additional uplift or\ncompressive capacity is often gained economically.\nCommon sizes for substation foundations range from 0.61 meter (24 inches) to l.52 meters (60 inches) in\ndiameter, in 150-mm (6-inch) increments.  Drilled shafts above 2.13 meters (84 inches) in diameter are\ntypically installed in 300-mm (12-inch) increments with a maximum diameter of 3.05 meters (120 inches)\navailable for extreme substation applications.\nThe engineer should attempt to utilize the same shaft diameter for as many foundations as practical.\nBelling of the shaft is less frequently performed for substation foundations, but has cost advantages when\npermissible.\nFor most substation equipment support structures and line support structures, the foundations are required\nto resist moderate shear forces and overturning moments.  For A-frame and lattice-type line support\nstructures, shear, uplift, and compression are typical design loads.  Drilled shafts also provide improved\nperformance against differential settlement for critical transformer structures and have been used to\nprovide support against overturning loads resulting from wind or seismic design conditions.\n8.3.2  Drilled Shaft Design\nDrilled shaft foundations derive their support to carry loads based on the shaft’s shape (straight versus\nbelled), soil/rock stratification, groundwater level, and applied loads.  Generally, compressive loads are\ncarried by a combination of skin friction along the shaft’s perimeter and end bearing at the base.  In cases\nwhere shafts bear upon or in rock, the overlying soil skin friction is typically discounted for design.\nUplift loads are carried as skin friction alone for straight shafts.  Shafts with bells require special review\nas to their capacity and the load transference mechanism based upon soil strata types and depth-to-\ndiameter ratios of shaft and bell embedment.  Lateral loads (shear and/or moment) are carried by the\nlateral resistance of soil/rock against the shaft’s cross section.\nThe spacing of shafts for adjacent structures, commonly referred to as group action, should be evaluated\nto prevent or minimize stress overlap from skin friction or lateral stresses.  A common rule of thumb is to\nmaintain a minimum shaft spacing (centerline to centerline) of not less than three times the diameter,\nalthough selected research has indicated that some soil types may require a greater shaft spacing.\nTypically, compression and uplift loads are designed separate from lateral design analyses. Conventional\nfactors of safety are applied to compression and uplift soil resistance to account for potential variability of\nsubsurface conditions.  Depending on the method of lateral load analysis used for design, the lateral\ndesign may or may not use factors of safety.  Methods employed that evaluate shaft deflection and\nrotation performance typically do not use factors of safety since they are determining the predicted\nload/deformation characteristics of the drilled shafts under the design loading.\nSpecific techniques for design of shafts have been documented quite thoroughly by others.  One useful\nsource in performing final design is IEEE Std. 691, “IEEE Trial-Use Guide for Transmission Structure\nFoundation Design,” which was jointly authored by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers\nand the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)."

    "content": "Bulletin 1724E-300\nPage 470\nFor purposes of lateral design of drilled shaft foundations, several techniques exist to evaluate shaft\nperformance.  With the advent of computers and the ability to evaluate multiple length and diameter shaft\ncombinations readily, lateral analysis of shafts has been performed by methods employing computer\nstress/strain relationships rather than the older rough calculations by hand using ultimate strength of a\npassive pressure wedge.\nThe design of drilled shafts for lateral loads should account for the effects of soil/rock–structure\ninteraction between shaft and subsurface stratas to account for deflection and rotation of the shafts.  Final\ndesign methods employing this conventional process are described under Method A presented below.  In\n1995 the Rural Utilities Service generated a Design Guide, RUS Bulletin 1724E-205, “Embedment\nDepths for Concrete and Steel Poles, ”  for preliminary selection of embedment depths for concrete and\nsteel poles.  Selected literature from this document is referenced in RUS Bulletin 1724E-205 is briefly\ndescribed under Method B presented below.  Previous procedures identified in the 1978 predecessor\nedition of this manual are again provided and described under Method C.  It is recommended that the\nMethod C procedures for evaluating the ultimate capacity and deflection, based on hand calculation\nprocedures (e.g., Czerniak 1957; Broms 1964) be used primarily for preliminary design or cost estimating\npurposes.  Along with the earlier mentioned FHWA publications and IEEE Std. 691, government\nagencies including the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials require\ncomputer-modeled finite difference procedures like those described in Method A.\n8.3.2.1  Method A—Lateral Drilled Shaft Design (Computer-Modeled Soil Interaction Curves) :\nDrilled shaft response is dependent upon the applied load,  the soil/rock stratigraphy (including\ngroundwater level), and the dimensional and physical features of the drilled shaft.  Under applied load,\nsoil–structure interaction behaves in either a linear-elastic, elastic-plastic, or ultimate-plastic state,\ndepending on the soil subgrade modulus.  The resulting load-displacement relationship has been described\nby Reese and O’Neill in FHWA publications as nonlinear subgrade modulus P-Y curves.  A similar\ndesign/analysis model has been prepared and developed by EPRI (Project RP-1280-1).\nThe use of P-Y curves describing the relationship between lateral pressure P and lateral displacement Y at\nindividual stations along the length of the shaft permits the computer program to solve for deflected\nshapes of the shaft, as developed for the specific stratigraphic soils present.  It is possible to assign rock\nfixity with Reese’s program at any point along the shaft and to account for additional rotational restraints,\nsuch as grade beams or slab inter-ties.\nOutput from the computer analysis includes deflections, rotations, internal moments, internal shears, and\nsoil reactions along the entire shaft length.  Moments and shears generated by the program are used by\nstructural engineers to design the amount and spacing of longitudinal and tie steel.  The program further\npermits evaluation of shaft performance under the cracked section analysis, resulting in a more accurate\nrepresentation of shaft and structure movement under load.\nReese’s fundamental theoretical principles were documented in 1977 and 1988.  The computer program\n(COM624) was originally developed for the FHWA and is currently available through the Center for\nMicrocomputers in Transportation, McTRANS Center, as sponsored by the University of Florida at\nGainesville.  Other comparable commercial versions of this public domain program are also available for\npurchase.\n8.3.2.2  Method B—Lateral Shaft Resistance Design (RUS-Hansen Approach):   With the\nincreasing use of both concrete and steel (light-duty) poles as replacements for wood poles in selected\ninstances, RUS documented a method of evaluating pole embedment using an earlier referenced approach\nprepared by Hansen in 1961 for stratified soils."

Further, the depth of water will impact these design\ncapacities.\n8.3.4.1  Compression Capacity :  Axial compressive loads applied to a drilled shaft are resisted by both\nskin friction and end bearing.  Initially, as loads are applied, they are generally transferred as skin friction\nto the soil with increasing depth, and then redistributed from the top of the shaft down as loads increase.\nWith increased axial compressive loads, the relative percentage of load carried at the base as end bearing\nincreases.  This load transfer mechanism is impacted by such factors as type of soil, depth of strata along\nshaft, base support material, water level, in situ stresses, construction methods employed, and relative size\nand shape of the shaft.\nAn extensive amount of research has been performed on drilled shafts utilizing full-scale load tests to\nanalyze the soil/structure interaction.  Although numerous approaches have been documented, the\ngenerally accepted procedure for straight shafts in cohesive soils is described as the “Alpha” method and\nin cohesionless soils as the “K O” method.( )\n()() ( )\n()022.1 176269.36.4715.0 535200\n22.1 176269.3L6.47200L3=+− −\n()()\n()()kNm562\n22.1 176269.3010.06.476.47545.06.4715.0 535 M bending max= + +=\n()()grade belowm63.022.1 176269.3010.06.47@817.0 ="

At depth-to-diameter ratios less than 4.0,\nthe N c factor has to be adjusted toward shallow foundation design in accordance with Vesic, but will not\nbe less than 5.14 according to Terzaghi (1943).\nThe Alpha factor has been developed from numerous studies by researchers and is generally considered to\nbe similar to Figure 8-5 for drilled shafts by Kulhawy and Jackson (dependent upon shear strength).\nBecause of the variability of soils, even with a comprehensive subsurface investigation, a factor of safety\nin compression of 2.0 to 3.0 is typically used for cohesive soils.  A higher factor of safety in cohesive\nsoils is justified to recognize the more long-term tendency of cohesive soils to experience settlement... 412-8 Equation ..11-8 Equation \n20\nSFcNDQSFcLD QQ Q Q\nc B\nEBH\niSFEB SF T\ni\npap\n==+=\n∑="

The\ncritical depth factor depends on soil density and generally varies between 10 to 20 times the shaft\ndiameter.  In theory, the crushing of sand grain particles and the resulting failure to achieve higher skin\nfriction and end-bearing components occurs at depths where the shaft length exceeds these critical depth\nfactors, and therefore the maximum effective stress has to be limited in the calculations.\nDue to the relatively deep depth of drilled shafts, the bearing capacity factor Nq is generally discounted in\nthe equation for end bearing and the relatively small percentage of overall capacity.\nConsider total shaft settlement due to axial compressive loads.  Settlement depends on the elastic\nshortening of the shaft and soil characteristics.  Consolidation from uncompacted fills, landfills, organic\nlayers, or collapsible or dispersive soils may result in unacceptable settlement or long-term negative skin-\nfriction (down drag) of shafts.  Rock formations should be evaluated to determine the mass formation\nproperties such as weathering, joints and fractures, and clay filled cracks.\nBelled shafts are frequently used where local soil conditions permit short-term stability of the bell.\nWhere soils permit belled construction, typically cohesive soils and some shales, and total settlement is\nnot anticipated to be excessive under higher loading, the base diameter may be used when determining the\nend bearing capacity.  Typically, the length of the shaft occupied by the bell is discounted when\ndetermining the skin friction component.\nA factor of safety in compression of 2.0 is typically used for cohesionless soils.\n8.3.4.2  Uplift Capacity\n8.3.4.2.1  Cohesive ( Undrained) Soil :  Axial uplift capacity of straight shafts is derived from the skin\nfriction or adhesion component of the shaft compressive capacity calculated in Equation 8-13.  In\naddition, the effective dead weight of the shaft may be added (unfactored) to the resistance to uplift.  This\neffective weight consists of the total weight of the shaft above the ground water level and the buoyant\nweight of the shaft below.\nDependent upon the shaft depth-to-diameter ratio, and whether the shaft is belled, other failure surface\nconcepts have been developed.  For relatively shallow shafts or belled shafts, the methodology introduced\nby Meyerhof and Adams is recommended.  This approach considers the shaft base to perform as an\ninverse bearing capacity failure without skin friction support, as either a cone-shaped or curved surface\nfailure mode."

However, the construction of belled shafts within a cohesionless soil is impractical and\nminimizes the likelihood of this approach, except for shafts that are backfilled entirely after an open\nexcavation.\nA factor of safety in uplift of 1.5 is typically used for cohesionless soils.  The effective weight of the\nshafts (total above the groundwater level and buoyant below) may be added as an unfactored component.\n8.3.5  Spread Footings\n8.3.5.1  General:   Spread footings comprised of a vertical pier or wall seated on a square or rectangular\nslab located at some depth below grade have long been used in substation design.\nThey are usually preferred for transformers, breakers, and other electrical equipment.  They are\neconomical where only a small quantity of foundations is required.  They are reliable and easy to design.\nThe installation time and costs for spread footings are more than for augered piers because of the\nexcavation, forming, form stripping, backfilling, and compacting.\nCompaction of backfill around spread footings should at least be equal to that of the undisturbed soil\nbefore the footing was installed.\nSpread footings should always be seated at a depth below the average frost penetration of the area.  See\nFigure 8-6.\nCAUTION:   The engineer should determine if the average frost depth will be sufficient for the prevailing\nconditions.  Deeper footings may be warranted.\n8.3.5.2  Design for Compression:   In designing a spread footing for only downward loads, divide the\ntotal net load by the allowable soil-bearing capacity and obtain the area of the footing required.\nCAUTION:   In granular soils the water table location may have significant effect on the allowable soil\ncapacity.\nEquation 8-16\nWhere:\nA =Area of footing base, in m2 (sf)\nTotal Net Load =LL + DL – Wt of displaced soil\nLL =Maximum weight or force exerted on footing by equipment or structure\nDL =Weight of foundation\nP =Allowable soil bearing pressure, in kg/m2 (psf)PLoadNet TotalA="

Several sizes may be selected before\none is obtained that will result in the desired safety factor, 1.5 minimum.

Slabs on grade should be used with caution\nwhere there is a chance of frost heave.  This may cause problems with equipment that has rigid bus\nconnections or in some other way may result in an operational malfunction of the equipment.\nSlabs on grade may be satisfactory in frost-prone climates if the subgrade is essentially granular and well\ndrained.\n8.3.6.2  Subgrade Preparation:   An important part of the installation of a slab on grade is the\npreparation of the subgrade.  The soil should be thoroughly mixed and compacted to provide a nearly\nhomogeneous, firm bearing surface.  Proper preparation may help prevent objectionable settlement.\nSlabs usually vary in thickness between 30 and 60 cm (12 and 24 inches) depending on the various design\nparameters.  The slab should bear on the prepared subgrade and not on site stone or stone in oil retention\nsumps.\n8.3.6.3  Applied Loads:   The types of loads (compression and overturning) that are typically present in\nspread footings are also present in slab-on-grade foundations for equipment.  Compression loads include\nthe equipment weight and, in soil pressure calculations, the foundation weight.  In the case of transformer\nfoundations, the equipment weight plus the weight of the contained insulating oil has to be included.  For\ntransformers, jacking loads have to be also be considered.  The jacking loads are considered by the\nstructural engineer in a check for local punching failure through the slab.  Jacking loads are “point” loads\ngenerated as hydraulic jacks are used to raise and level the transformer on the slab.  There are typically\nfour jacking points, one in each corner of the transformer.\nOverturning loads occur when horizontal loads act on the equipment at the top of the slab on grade.\nWhile overturning moments in a spread footing are transferred to the base slab through the concrete\npedestal, overturning loads on a slab on grade are transferred through the base of the equipment. Wind\nloads, seismic loads, and horizontal dynamic loads are included in the list of loads that would contribute\nto overturning.  Horizontal dynamic loads might include the circuit-tripping load from an oil-filled circuit\nbreaker.  Also, equipment eccentricity can contribute to overturning.  This is a case where the center of\ngravity of the equipment is not in line with the centerline of the slab.\n8.3.6.4  Design for Stability:   As with spread footings, slab-on-grade foundations have to be designed\nto not exceed the allowable soil pressure for the site.  The allowable soil bearing pressure is site specific\nand should be determined by a geotechnical engineer following a subsurface investigation.  In the absence\nof subsurface information, a reasonable range can be taken between 48 and 72 kN/m2 (1000 and 1500\npsf).  This, however, may or may not be a conservative range for the given site.\nIn addition to keeping the soil pressure below the slab under an allowable limit, an adequate safety factor\nagainst overturning has to be maintained.  The approach is similar to that for spread footings.\n8.3.6.4.1  Design Example 8-3 :\nCheck the soil bearing pressure and the factor of safety against overturning for a transformer slab based\non the following assumptions:"

Usually stone 5 to 9 cm (2 to 3½ inches) is desirable in the sump area\nto provide operators and maintenance personnel easy access to and around the transformer.  The size and\ngradation of the stone affects the percentage of voids available to store oil.  Stone of the size mentioned\nabove may provide 25 to 40 percent voids.  Perforated pipe placed in the bottom of the sump will convey,\nby gravity flow, water and oil to an underground storage tank.  The tank has to have a sump pump to\nperiodically pump out the water that has collected from rainfall.  The pump may be regulated to cut on\nand off by a float valve or pressure switches.  The transformer also should have a low-oil-level alarm that\ndeactivates the sump pump.\nAt the cutoff position, there should be at least 6 inches of water covering the bottom of the tank.  This\nenables small or slow oil leaks to be stored on top of the water.  The storage tank should be designed to\nretain all the oil in one transformer between cutoff water level and inlet pipe.\nThe oil is removed from the tank by pump trucks.\nThe system is costly but reasonably reliable.  Mechanical failure of the sump pump is a disadvantage.\nA variation of the approach discussed above is the utilization of a special oil-sensing control unit that\nworks with a submersible drainage pump.  The pump is placed in a vault outside the sump as described\nabove.  The pump discharges rainwater from the system, but is deactivated by the control unit when oil is\ndetected.\n8.4.2  Oil Separator Tank\nThis system is feasible only where there is sufficient gradient for gravity discharge from the underground\ntank.  See Figure 8-15.\nThe oil or water is collected from the transformer area as it was in the basic retention system.  It is\ndischarged into an oil separator tank.  The principle upon which this system operates is that oil is lighter\nthan water and floats upon it.\nThe oil separator tank should be designed to contain all the oil in one transformer should a major rupture\noccur.  This system allows the water to continuously pass through but retains the oil.  The oil retained in\nthe tank has to be pumped into a tank truck and disposed of.\nThis system is costly but quite reliable.\nThe oil separator tank principle may be applied to above-grade diked basins where freezing temperatures\nare not prevalent.\nModification to the above-grade separator system may be considered when regular inspection is\nanticipated.  It could consist of a transformer area that is lined and diked with impervious material.  A\nshort piece of 4-inch pipe passes through the dike and contains a shutoff valve that may be left open for\ncontinuous drainage and closed in an emergency when alarms occur or inspection indicates."

    "content": "Bulletin 1724E-300\nPage 501\nCHAPTER 9\nGROUNDING\n9.1 GENERAL\nThis chapter is concerned with safe grounding practices and design for outdoor ac substations\n(distribution and transmission) for power frequencies in the range of 50 to 60 Hz.  DC substations and the\neffect of lightning surges are not covered by this chapter.\nAn effective substation grounding system typically consists of driven ground rods, buried interconnecting\ngrounding cables or grid, equipment ground mats, connecting cables from the buried grounding grid to\nmetallic parts of structures and equipment, connections to grounded system neutrals, and the ground\nsurface insulating covering material.  Currents flowing into the grounding grid from lightning arrester\noperations, impulse or switching surge flashover of insulators, and line-to-ground fault currents from the\nbus or connected transmission lines all cause potential differences between grounded points in the\nsubstation and remote earth.  Without a properly designed grounding system, large potential differences\ncan exist between different points within the substation itself.  Under normal circumstances, it is the\ncurrent flow through the grounding grid from line-to-ground faults that constitutes the main threat to\npersonnel.\nAn effective grounding system has the following objectives:\n1. Ensure such a degree of human safety that a person working or walking in the vicinity of\ngrounded facilities is not exposed to the danger of a critical electric shock. The touch and step\nvoltages produced in a fault condition have to be at safe values. A safe value is one that will\nnot produce enough current within a body to cause ventricular fibrillation.\n2. Provide means to carry and dissipate electric currents into earth under normal and fault\nconditions without exceeding any operating and equipment limits or adversely affecting\ncontinuity of service.\n3. Provide grounding for lightning impulses and the surges occurring from the switching of\nsubstation equipment, which reduces damage to equipment and cable.\n4. Provide a low resistance for the protective relays to see and clear ground faults, which\nimproves protective equipment performance, particularly at minimum fault.\nIt should be recognized that there is no overall record of injuries resulting from deficient grounding\nsystems.  Equally, however, it should be appreciated that, with more substations being built, higher fault\ncurrents become possible.  Therefore, it is becoming more important to protect against personal injury and\nequipment damage.\nWhile line-to-ground faults may result in currents of tens of thousands of amperes lasting several seconds,\nmodern relay systems generally reduce the fault duration to a few cycles.  During fault current flow, a low\nground grid resistance to remote earth, although desirable, will not, in itself, necessarily provide safety to\npersonnel.  It is necessary that the entire grounding system be designed and installed so that, under\nreasonably conceivable circumstances, personnel are not exposed to hazardous potential differences\nacross the body.\nDesigning a proper substation grounding system is complicated.  Numerous parameters affect its design,\nand it is often difficult to obtain accurate values for some of these parameters.  Furthermore, temperature\nand moisture conditions can cause extreme variations in the actual resistivity of the ground in which the"

Methods of dealing with the design problem are necessarily based to some extent on\napproximations and the exercise of engineering judgment.  The design approach has to be conservative\nbecause of the aforementioned uncertainties.\nA good grounding system provides a low resistance to remote earth in order to minimize the ground\npotential rise.  For most transmission and other large substations, the ground resistance is usually about 1\nΩ or less.  In smaller distribution substations the usually acceptable range is from 1 to 5 Ω, depending on\nlocal conditions.\nFor reference material, IEEE Std. 80, “Guide for Safety in Substation Grounding,” is generally recognized\nas one of the most authoritative guides available.  It is recommended for any person concerned with the\ndesign of substation grounding systems.  A bibliography in the IEEE guide lists important additional\nreferences, including abstracts of many of them.\nThis chapter describes some of the different modes in which ground fault current may flow with respect\nto substation grounding systems.  Included is discussion of safety considerations in and near substations\nwhen all or a portion of this fault current flows through the substation grounding system.  Specific\nrecommendations for the design, installation, and testing of safe and effective grounding systems for RUS\nsubstations are included.\nThe design procedures presented in this chapter are based on IEEE Std. 80, “Guide for Safety in\nSubstation Grounding.”  IEEE Std. 80 presents a simplified design procedure for substation grounding\nthat meets the required safety criteria without the use of an expensive computer software program.  The\nsections of this chapter are presented in the order in which they should be performed.\nThe first aspect of substation grounding is how to take and analyze soil resistivity measurements (Section\n9.3).  Next, Section 9.4 shows the importance of the area of the ground grid.  Section 9.5 discusses and\nillustrates some of the cases governing fault current flow.  The engineer will use the split factor (Section\n9.5.2) to take into account that not all of the fault current uses the earth as a return path.  The split factor\ncan be calculated from graphs instead of formulas; these graphs are one of the major improvements to\ngrounding design from previous grounding design manuals.\nOnce the maximum grid current is determined (Section 9.5.4), the engineer will use the maximum grid\ncurrent to choose the type and size of the ground grid conductors needed (Section 9.6).  Section 9.6 also\nexamines how to connect substation equipment to the ground grid and the type of connector to use.\nSection 9.7.1 shows the importance of high-speed relays by calculating the tolerable limits of current to\nthe body, and in Section 9.7.2 the typical shocks situations are illustrated in Figures 9-28 and 9-29 (see\npage 541 and 542 of this bulletin).  Tolerable touch and step voltages are discussed in Section 9.8, which\nare the design criteria of a safe grounding design.  Section 9.9 provides the benefits of protective surface\nmaterials, such as gravel, in improving the tolerable touch and step voltages.\nIn Section 9.10, all the information in the previous sections is pulled together in a step-by-step approach\nto designing a substation grounding system.  Once a safe ground grid has been designed, the proper\ngrounding of the substation fence (Section 9.10.10.1) and the operating handles on switches, cable\nsheaths, and surge arresters (Section 9.10.10.3) is discussed."

Substation sites where the soil may possess uniform\nresistivity throughout the entire area and to a considerable depth are seldom found.  Typically, there are\nseveral layers, each having a different resistivity.  Often, lateral changes also occur, but, in comparison to\nthe vertical ones, these changes usually are more gradual.  Make soil resistivity tests to determine if there\nare any important variations of resistivity with depth.  The number of such readings taken should be\ngreater where the variations are large, especially if some readings are so high as to suggest a possible\nsafety problem.\nA number of measuring techniques are described in detail in IEEE Std. 81-1983.  The Wenner four-pin\nmethod as shown in Figure 9-1 is the most commonly used technique.  In brief, four probes are driven\ninto the earth along a straight line, at equal distances a apart, driven to a depth b.  The voltage between the\ntwo inner (potential) electrodes is then measured and divided by the current between the two outer\n(current) electrodes to give a value of resistance, R.  Then,\nEquation 9-1\n2 2 2 24214\nb aa\nb aaaR\na\n+−\n++=pr\nWhere:\nra =Apparent resistivity of the soil in Ω-m\nR =Measured resistance in ohms\na =Distance between adjacent electrodes in meters\nb =Depth of the electrodes in meter s\nIf b is small compared to a, as is the case of probes penetrating the ground only a short distance,\nEquation  9-1 can be reduced to Equation 9-2:\nEquation 9-2\naR2aπ=ρ\nThe current tends to flow near the surface for the small probe spacing, whereas more of the current\npenetrates deeper soils for large spacing.  Thus, it is usually a reasonable approximation to assume that\nthe resistivity measured for a given probe spacing a represents the apparent resistivity of the soil to a\ndepth of a when soil layer resistivity contrasts are not excessive.  Equations 9-1 and 9-2, thus, can be used\nto determine the apparent resistivity ra at a depth a.\nThere are a number of reasons for the popularity of the Wenner four-pin method shown in Figure 9-1.\nThe four-pin method obtains the soil resistivity data for deeper layers without driving the test pins to\nthose layers.  No heavy equipment is needed to perform the four-pin test.  The results are not greatly\naffected by the resistance of the test pins or the holes created in driving the test pins into the soil.\nResistivity measurement records should include temperature data and information on the moisture content\nof the soil at the time of measurement.  Also record all data available on known buried conductive objects\nin the area studied.  Buried conductive objects in contact with the soil can invalidate resistivity"

This is particularly true for\nlarge or long objects.\nFigure 9-1:  Wenner Four-Pin Method.  Ref. IEEE Std. 80, Draft 13, June 19, 1998,\nFigure 13-1.  Copyright © 1998.  IEEE.  All rights reserved.\nA good reference useful for an understanding of both resistivity and grounding system resistance\nmeasurements is contained in the manual entitled Getting Down-To-Earth  by the Biddle Co.  This manual\nis available from AVO International, 261 Van Buren Rd., Trooper, Pennsylvania 19403, order number\nAVTM25TA (www.avointl.com).  Helpful information is also given in IEEE Stds. 81 and 81.2.\n9.3.1  Analyzing Soil Resistivity Measurements\nInterpretation of apparent resistivity obtained in the field is perhaps the most difficult part of the\nmeasurement program.  The basic objective is to derive a soil model that is a good approximation of the\nactual soil.  Soil resistivity varies laterally and with respect to depth, depending on the soil stratification.\nSeasonal variations may occur in soil resistivity due to varying weather conditions.  It has to be\nrecognized that the soil model is only an approximation of the actual soil conditions and that a perfect\nmatch is unlikely.\nThe most commonly used soil resistivity models are the uniform soil model and the two-layer soil model.\nTwo-layer soil models are often a good approximation of many soil structures while multi-layer soil\nmodels may be used for more complex soil conditions.  Interpretation of the soil resistivity measurements\nmay be accomplished either manually or by use of computer analysis techniques described in numerous\nreferences.\nA uniform soil model should be used only when there is a moderate variation in apparent resistivity.  In\nhomogeneous soil conditions, which rarely occur in practice, the uniform soil model may be reasonably\naccurate.  If there is a large variation in measured apparent resistivity, the uniform soil model is unlikely\nto yield accurate results.\nA more accurate representation of the actual soil conditions can be obtained through use of a two-layer\nmodel.  The two-layer model consists of an upper layer of finite depth and with different resistivity than a\nlower layer of infinite thickness.  There are several techniques to determine an equivalent two-layer\nmodel from apparent resistivity obtained from field tests.  In some instances a two-layer model can be\napproximated by visual inspection of a plot of the apparent resistivity versus depth from driven rod\nmeasurements or apparent resistivity versus probe spacing from Wenner four-pin measurements.\nComputer programs available to the industry may also be used to derive two-layer and multi-layer soil\nmodels."

Unfortunately, an upper bound of the error on all relevant\ngrounding parameters is difficult to estimate.  In general, however, when the contrast between the various\nlayer resistivities is moderate, an average soil resistivity value may be used as a first approximation or to\nestablish orders of magnitude.

Measures such as adding additional grid conductor are expensive and do not reduce the grid\nresistance to the extent that increasing the area does.\nIn general, the outer grid conductors should be placed on the boundary of the substation site with the\nsubstation fence placed a minimum of 3 feet inside the outer conductors. This results in the lowest\npossible grid resistance and protects persons outside the fence from possibly hazardous touch voltages. It\nis therefore imperative that the fence and the ground grid layout be coordinated early in the design\nprocess.\nThe simplified design equations require square, rectangular, triangular, T-shaped, or L-shaped grids.  For\npreliminary design purposes, on a layout drawing of the substation site, draw in the largest square,\nrectangular, triangular, T-shaped, or L-shaped grids that will fit within the site.  These represent the outer\ngrid conductors and will define the area of the grid to be used in the calculations.  A square, rectangular,\ntriangular, T-shaped, or L-shaped grid site generally requires no additional conductors once the design is\ncomplete.  For irregular sites, once the design has been completed, additional conductors will be run\nalong the perimeter of the site that were not included in the original grid design and connected to the grid.\nThis will take advantage of the entire site area available and will result in a more conservative design.\n9.5 GROUND FAULT CURRENTS\nWhen a substation bus or transmission line is faulted to ground, the flow of ground current in both"

The flow may be\nbetween portions of a substation ground grid, between the ground grid and surrounding earth, along\nconnected overhead ground wires, or along a combination of all these paths.\nThe relay engineer is interested in the current magnitudes for all system conditions and fault locations so\nthat protective relays can be applied and coordinating settings made.  The designer of the substation\ngrounding system is interested primarily in the maximum amount of fault current expected to flow\nthrough the substation grid, especially that portion from or to remote earth, during the service lifetime of\nthe installed design.\nFigures 9-2 through 9-5 illustrate some of the cases governing ground fault current flow.  The worst case\nfor fault current flow between the substation grounding grid and surrounding earth in terms of effect on\nsubstation safety has to be determined.  The maximum symmetrical rms fault current at the instant of fault\ninitiation is usually obtained from a network analyzer study or by direct computation.  IEEE Std. 80\nprovides methods for direct computation of the maximum symmetrical rms fault current.\nFigure 9-2:  Fault Within Local Substation, Local Neutral Grounded.\nRef.

Note that this value\nis given as a percentage and should be converted to decimal notation before using in an equation.\n9.5.3  The Decrement Factor, D f\nThe decrement factor accounts for the asymmetrical fault current wave shape during the early cycles of a\nfault as a result of the dc current offset.  In general, the asymmetrical fault current includes the\nsubtransient, transient, and steady -state ac components, and the dc offset current component.  Both the\nsubtransient and transient ac components and the dc offset decay exponentially, each having a different\nattenuation rate.  However, in typical applications of this guide, it is assumed that the ac component does\nnot decay with time but remains at its initial value.\nThe decrement factor can be calculated using Equation 9-7:\nEquation 9-7\nDT\nte fa\nft\nTf\na=+ −\n\n\n\n−\n1 12\nWhere:\ntf = Time duration of fault in seconds\nTa =  X/(ωR)  =  the dc offset time constant in seconds\nFor 60 Hz,\nTa = X/(120 πR)\nThe selection of tf should reflect the fastest clearing time (relay plus breaker time) for transmission\nsubstations and worst-case backup clearing time for distribution and industrial substations.  This\nconservative approach results in the highest D f.\nThe X/R ratio used in the calculation of T a is the system X/R ratio, inductive reactance to resistance, at\nthe fault location for a given fault type.  The X and R components of the system subtransient fault\nimpedance should be used to determine the X/R ratio.  The X/R ratio is the rate of decay of any dc offset.\nA large X/R ratio corresponds to a large time constant and a slow rate of decay.\nEquation 9-7 can be used to compute the decrement factor for specific X/R ratios and fault duration.\nTypical values of the decrement factor for various fault durations and X/R ratios are shown in Table 9-1."

Typically, only a\nfraction of the total fault current flows from the grounding system into the earth.  This is due to the\ntransfer of current onto metallic paths such as overhead static shields, water pipelines, etc.\nFaults occurring within the substation generally do not produce the worst earth currents since there are\ndirect conductive paths that the fault current can follow to reach the system neutral (assuming the\nsubstation has a grounded-wye transformer).  The faults that produce the largest ground currents are\nusually line-to-ground faults occurring at some distance away from the substation.\nThe maximum grid current is the current that flows through the grid to remote earth and is calculated by\nEquation 9-8.\nEquation 9-8\nI DI G f g= ⋅\nWhere:\nIG =Maximum grid current in amperes\nDf =Decrement factor for the entire duration of fault tf, found for tf, given in seconds\nIg =rms symmetrical grid current in amperes (calculated in Section 9.5.1)\n9.5.5  Asymmetrical Fault\nThe asymmetrical fault current includes the subtransient, transient, and steady-state ac components, and\nthe dc offset current component and can be defined as shown in Equation 9-9:\nEquation 9-9\nI DI F f f= ⋅"

Copper conductors, in addition to\ntheir high conductivity, have the advantage of being resistant to most underground corrosion because\ncopper is cathodic with respect to most other metals that are likely to be buried in the vicinity.\n9.6.1.2  Copper-Clad Steel:  Copper-clad steel is usually used for underground rods and occasionally\nfor grounding grids, especially where theft is a problem.  Use of copper, or to a lesser degree copper-clad\nsteel, ensures that the integrity of an underground network will be maintained for years, so long as the\nconductors are of an adequate size and not damaged and the soil conditions are not corrosive to the\nmaterial used.\nOther types of ground conductor materials are discussed in IEEE Std. 80.\n9.6.2  Ground Conductor Sizing\nThe ground conductor for both the grid and equipment connections should be sized according to\nEquation  9-10:\nEquation 9-10\n\n\n\n\n++⋅\n\n\n\nρα=\na om o\nrr ckcmil\nT KT Kln\ntTCAP4.971I A\nWhere:\nI =rms fault current in kA\nAkcmil =Area of conductor in kcmil\nTm =Maximum allowable temperature in oC\nTa =Ambient temperature in oC\nTr =Reference temperature for material constants in oC\nao =Thermal coefficient of resistivity at 0oC in 1/oC\nar =Thermal coe fficient of resistivity at reference temperature Tr in 1/oC\nrr =Resistivity of the ground conductor at reference temperature Tr in µΩ-cm"

Another more conservative approach is to use I F (Section 9.5.5) for I in\nEquation 9-10.\nThe use of I F will result in a larger conductor that will provide extra strength for installation, take into\naccount the effects of corrosion, and provide some margin for unexpected future system expansion. It is\nbest to be conservative and provide an adequate margin when sizing the ground grid conductors as a\nresult of the expense involved in replacing or upgrading existing ground conductors at a later date.\n9.6.5  Additional Conductor Sizing Factors\nThe designer should take precautions to ensure that the temperature of any conductor and connection in\nthe grounding installation does not pose a danger to the safe operation of the substation.  For instance:\na. Typically, conductors and connections near flammable materials should be subject to more\nstringent temperature limitations.\nb. If the strength of hard-drawn copper is required for mechanical reasons, then it may be prudent\nnot to exceed 250oC to prevent annealing of the conductors.\nCarefully examine the possible exposure to a corrosive environment.  Even when the correct conductor\nsize and the selected joining (connecting) method have satisfied all the test requirements of IEEE\nStd. 837, “Qualifying Permanent Connections Used in Substation Grounding,” it may be prudent to\nchoose a larger conductor size to compensate for some gradual reduction in the conductor cross section\nduring the design life of the installation where the soil environment tends to promote corrosion.\n9.6.6  Connections from Equipment and Structures to Ground Grid\nPay careful attention to the connections of substation structures, equipment frames, and neutrals to the\nground grid to realize the benefits of an effective ground grid system.   Conductors of adequate ampacity\nand mechanical strength should be used for the connections between:\n1. All ground electrodes, such as grounding grids, rodbeds, ground wells, and, where applicable,\nmetal, water, or gas pipes, water well casings, etc."

All above-ground conductive metal parts that might accidentally become energized, such as\nmetal structures, machine frames, metal housings of conventional or gas -insulated switchgear,\ntransformer tanks, guards, etc.  Also, conductive metal parts that might be at a different\npotential relative to other metal parts that have become energized should be bonded together,\nusually via the ground grid.\n3. All fault current sources such as surge arresters, capacitor banks or coupling capacitors,\ntransformers, and, where appropriate, machine neutrals, lighting, and power circuits.\nSolid bare copper ground conductor or wire is usually employed for these ground connections.  However,\ntransformer tanks are sometimes used as part of a ground path for surge arresters on them.  Similarly,\nmost steel or aluminum structures may be used for the ground path if it can be established that their\nconductance, including that of any connections, is and can be maintained as equivalent to that of the\nconductor that would normally be installed.  Where this practice is followed, any paint films that might\notherwise introduce a highly resistive connection should be removed and a suitable joint compound\napplied or other effective means, such as jumpers across the connections, taken to prevent subsequent\ndeterioration of the connection.  Do not assume equal division of currents between multiple ground leads\nat cross -connections or similar junction points.\nExtra ground connections should be considered at all critical locations (such as at equipment neutrals,\nsurge arrester grounds, operating handles and ground mats, etc.) to ensure an effective grounding\ncapability even when one conductor is broken or a connection is improperly made.  Do not assume equal\ndivision of currents between multiple ground connections.\nSecurely attach the shortest possible length ground conductor to structures and/or equipment and form the\nconductor to conform to the foundation with minimum exposure to mechanical damage.  Conductor sizes\nfor any critical connection should not be smaller than 1/0 AWG to ensure mechanical adequacy.\nPeriodically inspect all accessible ground leads.  Exothermic weld, brazed, or compression-type\nconnectors can be used for underground connections.  However, exothermic welds are widely used and\nrecommended by RUS for underground connections.  Compression connectors if used in grounding\napplications should be of a type that compresses the conductor and the connector into a tight homogenous\nmass, removing virtually all air.  Use an oxide-inhibiting compound with all compression connectors to\nseal out air and moisture and prevent oxidation or corrosion in the connection.\nOxidation or corrosion in the connection can create hot spots that can shorten the life of\nthe connection.  With the connection below grade, there is no visual way of knowing\nwhen the connection has failed.  A properly installed exothermic connection is a\nmolecular connection that eliminates the oxidation and corrosion in the connection and\nreduces the opportunity for hot spots.\nThe connector chosen should satisfy the requirements of IEEE Std. 837.  Avoid soldered connections\nbecause of the possibility of failure under high fault currents.\n9.7 SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS\nUnder ground fault conditions, the portion of fault current flowing between a substation ground grid and\nthe surrounding earth, IG , will result in potential gradients within and around the substation.

In addition to the voltage magnitude of the local gradients, such things\nas duration of the current flow, impedances in its path, body resistance, physical condition of the person,\nand probability of contact all enter into the safety considerations.\n9.7.1  Tolerable Limits of Body Current\nThe most common physiological effects of electric current on the body, stated in order of increasing\ncurrent magnitude, are perception, muscular contraction, unconsciousness, fibrillation of the heart,\nrespiratory nerve blockage, and burning.\nThe threshold of perception for the human body is about one milliampere at commercial (50 or 60 Hz)\nfrequencies.  Currents of 1 to 6 mA, often termed let -go currents, though unpleasant to sustain, generally\ndo not impair the ability of a person holding an energized object to control his muscles and release it.\nHigher currents (about 9 to 25 mA) can result in painful situations and affect the muscles so that the\nenergized object is difficult if not impossible to release.  Still higher mA currents can affect breathing and\nmay cause fatalities if duration (usually on the order of minutes) is long enough.  Further current increases\n(about 60 mA and above) can result in ventricular fibrillation of the heart.  Sixty mA is approximately the\ncurrent drawn by a 7.5 watt 120 V lamp.  Currents above the level for ventricular fibrillation can cause\nheart paralysis, inhibition of breathing, and burns.\nSince currents of a magnitude that exceed let-go level can affect breathing, they have to be avoided if the\nduration is likely to be long.  Fortunately, in most situations in substations, the protective relays will\nprevent any fault from lasting that long.  Therefore, it is usually those levels of current that can lead to\nventricular fibrillation that form the basis for most potential gradient limitation efforts.\nIt is assumed that 99.5 percent of all persons can safely withstand, without ventricular fibrillation, the\npassage of a current with magnitude and duration determined by Equation 9-12:\nEquation 9-12\nIk\ntB\ns=\nWhere:\nIB= rms magnitude of the current through the body in amperes\nts = Duration of the current exposure in seconds\nk= Constant related to electric shock energy\nFor a person weighing 50 kg (110 lbs), k = 0.116\nFor a person weighing 70 kg (155 lbs), k = 0.157\nEquation 9-12 is based on tests limited to a range of between 0.03 and 3.0 s, and is not valid for very short\nor long durations.\nEquation 9-12 indicates that much higher body currents can be allowed where fast operating protective\ndevices can be relied upon to limit the fault duration.  An engineering decision based on judgment is\nneeded as to whether to use the clearing time of primary high-speed relays, or that of the backup\nprotection, as the basis for calculation."

In these figures E s is the step voltage,\nEt is the touch voltage, E m is the mesh voltage, and E trrd is the transferred voltage.\nDuring a fault, the earth conducts currents emanating from the grid and other permanent ground\nelectrodes buried below the earth surface.\nIn the case of conventional substations, the typical case of metal-to-metal touch voltage occurs when\nmetallic objects or structures within the substation site are not bonded to the ground grid.  Objects such as\npipes, rails, or fences not bonded to the ground grid that are located within or near the substation ground\ngrid area meet these criteria.  Substantial metal-to-metal touch voltages may be present when a person\nstanding on or touching a grounded object or structure comes into contact with a metallic object or\nstructure within the substation site that is not bonded to the ground grid.  Calculation of the actual metal-\nto-metal touch voltage is complex.  In practice, hazards resulting from metal-to-metal contact may best be\navoided by bonding potential danger points to the substation grid .\n9.8 TOLERABLE TOUCH AND STEP VOLTAGES\nThe tolerable touch and step voltages are the criteria that have to be met to ensure a safe design.  The\nlower the maximum touch and step voltages, the more difficult it is to produce an adequate grid design.\nIn most cases the tolerable touch voltage will be the limiting factor.  Figures 9-30 through 9-34 are used\nto derive the equations for maximum touch and step voltages.\nFigure 9-30:  Exposure to Touch Voltage.  Ref. IEEE Std. 80, Draft 13, June 19, 1998,\nFigure 7-1.

The surface material increases\nthe contact resistance between the soil and the feet of people in the substation.  The surface material is\ngenerally 0.08 to 0.15 meter (3 to 6 inches) in depth and extends 0.91 to 1.22 meters (3 to 4 feet) outside\nthe substation fence.  If the surface material does not extend outside the substation fence, then the touch\nvoltage may become dangerously high.\nA test at a substation in France showed that the river gravel used as surface material when moistened had\na resistivity of 5000 Ω-m.  A layer 0.1 to 0.15 meter (4 to 6 inches) thick decreased the ratio of body to\nshort -circuit current by a ratio of 10:1, as compared to the natural moist ground.\nThe range of resistivity values for the surface material layer depends on many factors, some of which are\nkinds of stone, size, condition of stone (that is, clean or with fines), amount and type of moisture content,\natmospheric contamination, etc.  Table 9-4 indicates that the resistivity of the water with which the rock is\nwet has considerable influence on the measured resistivity of the surface material layer.  Thus, surface\nmaterial subjected to sea spray may have substantially lower resistivity than surface material utilized in\narid environments."

Some of the reasons behind the system of vertical rods and\nhorizontal conductors are that horizontal (grid) conductors are most effective in reducing the danger of\nhigh step and touch voltages on the earth surface.  Vertical ground rods penetrating the lower resistivity\nsoil are far more effective in dissipating fault currents whenever a two- or multi-layer soil is encountered\nand the upper soil layer has a higher resistivity than the lower soil layer.  This is important because the\nresistivity of lower soil layers remains nearly constant with changing seasons while the upper soil layer\nresistivity may experience high resistivity conditions with seasonal changes due to the freezing or drying\nof the upper soil layer.\nSeveral parameters define the geometry of the grid, but the area of the grounding system, the conductor\nspacing, and the depth of the ground grid have the most impact on the mesh voltage, while parameters\nsuch as the conductor diameter and the thickness of the surfacing material have less impact. The area of\nthe grounding system is the single most important geometrical factor in determining the resistance of the\ngrid.  The larger the area grounded, the lower the grid resistance and, thus, the lower the GPR.\n9.10.2  Design Procedures\n1. The grounding system grid shall consist of a network of bare conductors buried in the earth to\nprovide for grounding connections to grounded neutrals, equipment ground terminals,\nequipment housings, and structures and to limit the maximum possible shock current during\nground fault conditions to safe values. If the calculated mesh and step voltages of the grid\ndesign are below the maximum values for touch and step voltage, then the design is considered\nadequate. Personnel may still receive a shock during fault conditions, but that shock will not\nbe sufficient to cause ventricular fibrillation.\n2. The ground grid should encompass all of the area within the substation fence and extend at\nleast 0.91 meter (3.0 feet) outside the substation fence.  A perimeter grid conductor should be\nplaced 0.91 meter (3.0 feet) outside and around the entire substation fence including the gates\nin any position.  A perimeter grid conductor should also surround the substation equipment\nand structure cluster in cases where the fence is located far from the cluster.\n3. A soil resistivity test, such as described in Section 9.3, will determine the soil resistivity\nprofile and the soil model needed (that is, uniform or two-layer model). Estimates of the\npreliminary resistance of the grounding system in uniform soil can be determined using\nEquation 9-3.  For the final design, more accurate estimates of the resistance may be desired.\nComputer analysis based on modeling the components of the grounding system in detail can\ncompute the resistance with a high degree of accuracy, assuming the soil model is chosen\ncorrectly.\n4. The fault current 3I0 should be the maximum expected future fault current that will be\nconducted by any conductor in the grounding system, and the time tc should reflect the\nmaximum possible clearing time (including backup)."

The\nchoice of time ts is based on the judgment of the design engineer, with guidance from IEEE\nStd. 80 (clauses 5.2 to 6.3).  Using the assumption that not all the worst-case conditions will be\npresent at the time of the fault, the worst-case primary  clearing time for the substation can be\nused for ts.  An extremely conservative design would use the backup clearing time for ts.\n6. The equipment ground conductor size is determined according to Section 9.6.2.\n7. The entire area inside the fence and including a minimum of 1.0 meter (3.3 feet) outside the\nfence needs to be covered with a minimum layer of 10 cm (4 inches) of protective surface\nmaterial such as crushed rock (or approved equal) possessing a minimum resistivity of\n3,000  ohm-meters wet or dry.\n8. The ground grid consists of horizontal (grid) conductors placed in the ground to produce\nsquare mesh.  This can be visualized as a checkerboard pattern.  One row of horizontal\nconductors is equally spaced 3 to 15 meters (9.8 to 49.2 feet) apart.  A second row of equally\nspaced horizontal conductors running perpendicular to the first row is spaced at a ratio of 1:1\nto 1:3 of the first row’s spacing.  For example, if the first row spacing was 3 meters (9.8 feet),\nthe second row spacing could be between 3 to 9 meters (9.8 to 29.5 feet).  The crossover point\nfor the first and second row of conductors should be securely bonded together.  The purpose of\nthe bonded connections is to ensure adequate control of surface potential, secure multiple\npaths for fault currents, minimize the voltage dorp in the grid, and provide a certain measure of\nredundancy in case of conductor failure.  Grid conductors range in size from 2/0 AWG\n(67 mm2) to 500 kcmil (253 mm2); the conductor diameter has negligible effect on the mesh\nvoltage.  The actual grid conductor size is calculated in accordance with Section 9.6.4.\n9. Grid conductors should be buried a minimum of 0.46 meter (18 inches) to 1.5 meters\n(59.1  inches) below final earth grade (excluding crushed rock covering) and may be plowed in\nor placed in trenches.  In soils that are normally quite dry near the surface, deeper burial may\nbe required to obtain desired values of grid resistance.\n10. Vertical ground rods may be at the grid corners and at junction points along the perimeter.\nGround rods may also be installed at major equipment, especially near surge arresters.  In\nmulti-layer or high-resistivity soils, it might be useful to use longer rods or rods installed at\nadditional junction points. Vertical ground rods should be 1.6 cm (5/8 inch) diameter by at\nleast 2.5-meter (8.0-foot) long copper, steel, or other approved type from the List of Materials,\nRUS IP 202-1.  Where used, they should be installed with tops 5 cm (1.97 inches) minimum\nbelow grade and bonded to the ground grid connectors.  A good design practice is to space\nrods not closer than their length.  An additional determinant is having enough rods so that their\naverage fault current pickup would not exceed 300 amperes, assuming all ground system\ncurrent entering the grid through the rods.\n11. If the GPR calculated according to Section 9.10.6 of the preliminary design is below the\ntolerable touch voltage, no further analysis is necessary.  The design needs only the\nrefinements required to provide access to equipment grounds.\n12. The calculation of the mesh and step voltages for the grid as designed can be done using the\napproximate analysis techniques described in Sections 9.10.4 and 9.10.5 for uniform soil."

If the computed mesh voltage is greater than the tolerable touch voltage, the\npreliminary design should be revised (see Section 9.10.7).\n14. Both the computed touch and step voltages have to be below the tolerable voltages.  If not, the\npreliminary design has to be revised (see Section 9.10.7).\n15. If either the step or touch tolerable limits are exceeded, revision of the grid design is required.\nThese revisions may include smaller conductor spacing, additional ground rods, etc.  More\ndiscussion on the revision of the grid design to satisfy the step and touch voltage limits is\ngiven in Section 9.10.7.\n16. After satisfying the step and touch voltage requirements, additional grid and ground rods may\nbe required.  The additional grid conductors may be required if the site is irregular or if the\ngrid design does not include conductors near equipment to be grounded.  Additional ground\nrods may be required at the base of surge arresters, transformer neutrals, etc.  Also review the\nfinal design to eliminate hazards due to transferred potential (Section 9.10.11) and hazards\nassociated with special areas of concern (Section 9.10.10).\n9.10.3  Preliminary Design\nThe design criteria are the tolerable touch and step voltages.  For a preliminary design, the grid will\nconsist of uniform square or rectangular mesh.  This is so the touch and step voltages calculated by the\nsimplified design equations of IEEE Std. 80 are valid for every location within the ground grid.  Once a\nsafe preliminary design has been achieved, then the ground grid may be modified so that the grid does not\nconsist entirely of uniform square or rectangular mesh.  These modifications are described in Section\n9.10.2, Step 16.  Make sure that all grid modifications do not result in mesh that is larger than the one\nused in the preliminary design since it could result in unsafe touch and step voltages.  Remember that\nadditional ground conductors added to the preliminary design will result in a more conservative design,\nand fewer ground conductors than the preliminary design could result in an unsafe design.\nTake the following steps to arrive at a preliminary design:\n1. On a layout drawing of the substation site, draw in the largest square, rectangular, triangular,\nT-shaped, or L-shaped grids that will fit within the site; this should already have been done to\ncalculate the grid area in Section 9.4.\n2. Place grid conductors to produce square mesh of approximately 6.1 to 12.2 meters (20 to\n40 feet) on a side.\n3. Set the grid depth, h, equal to 45.72 cm (18 inches).\n4. Set the thickness of surface material equal to 10.16 cm (4 inches).\n5. Place ground rods around the perimeter of the substation. As a general rule, place a ground rod\nat every other perimeter grid connection and at the corners of the substation. Since ground rods\ndischarge most of their current through their lower portion, they are effective in controlling the\nlarge current densities (and associated large step and touch potentials) that are present in the\nperimeter conductors during fault conditions."

Mesh voltages represent the highest possible touch\nvoltages that may be encountered within a substation’s grounding system and thus represent a practical\nbasis for designing a safe grounding system for within, and immediately outside, the substation fence\narea.  The mesh voltage has to be less than the tolerable touch voltage for the grounding system to be safe.\nHowever, the mesh voltage may not be the worst-case touch voltage if ground rods are located near the\nperimeter, or if the mesh spacing near the perimeter is small.  In these cases, the touch voltage at the\ncorner of the grid may exceed the corner mesh voltage.\nIn a substation that utilizes a grid as part of the grounding system, it is theoretically possible to design and\ninstall the grid in such a way that the mesh voltage can be kept within desired limits.\nThe mesh voltage values are obtained as a product of the geometrical factor Km, a corrective factor  Ki\nthat accounts for some of the error introduced by the assumptions made in deriving Km, the soil resistivity\n(r), and the average current per unit of effective buried length of the grounding system conductor ( IG/LM):\nEquation 9-22\nEKKI\nL mm iG\nM=⋅⋅⋅ r\nWhere:\nρ=Soil resistivity, Ω-m\nKm =Spacing facto r for mesh voltage, simplified method\nKi =Correction factor for grid geometry, simplified method\nIG =Maximum grid current that flows between ground grid and surrounding earth\n(including dc offset) in amperes\nLM =Effective length of L c + LR for mesh voltage in meters\nLc =Total length of grid conductor in meters\nLR =Total length of ground rods in meters\nThe geometrical factor Km is expressed by Equation 9-23:\nEquation 9-23\n( )\n()KD\nhdD h\nDdh\ndK\nK nmii\nh=\n⋅⋅\n⋅⋅++⋅\n⋅⋅−\n⋅\n\n\n\n+⋅\n⋅−\n\n\n\n\n\n1\n2 162\n8 48\n2 122\np pln ln\nWhere:\nD = Spacing between parallel conductors in mete rs\nd = Diameter of grid conductors in meters\nh = Depth of ground grid conductors in meters\nn = Geometric factor composed of factors n a, nb, nc, and nd\nKh= Corrective weighting factor that emphasizes the effects of grid depth, simplified method\nKii= Corrective weighting factor that adjusts for the effects of inner conductors on the corner\nmesh, simplified method"

Equation 9-38 also shows that a low earth resistivity is very important in keeping R g low.\nEarth resistivity varies with the temperature and moisture content of the soil and whether the soil is frozen\nor unfrozen.  For a given location, the earth resistivity is usually not controlled by the substation designer,\nalthough, in cases of very high soil resistivity, special treatments are sometimes used to help lower the\nvalue of ρ.\nWhenever the product I gRg results in a voltage below the tolerable touch voltage determined according to\nSection 9.8, there is no danger of ventricular fibrillation to most humans from body contact in any of the\ncases discussed.  If the product I gRg is in excess of allowable voltage values, then attention has to be given\nto elimination of possible exposure to transferred potentials and further investigation of touch and step\npotentials.\n9.10.7  Design Modifications\nIf the calculated grid mesh and step voltages are much greater than the maximum touch and step voltages,\nthen the preliminary design has to be modified.  To reduce the grid mesh and step voltages, the following\nmodifications can be tried:\n1. Decrease the mesh size by increasing the number of parallel conductors in each direction.\n2. Increase the thickness of the layer of surface rock.  A practical limit to the depth of the rock\nmay be 15.24 centimeters (6 inches)."

Other factors, however, will usually make this impractical.  Moreover, if\naccomplished at the expense of greater fault clearing time, the danger may be increased rather\nthan diminished.\nOther effective measures can be taken to reduce the design mesh and step voltages.  Their effects cannot\nbe modeled using the simplified design equations and have to be modeled using a computer program such\nas EPRI SGSYS.  These measures include the following:\n1. Place additional parallel conductors around the perimeter of the grid to produce smaller\nperimeter mesh.  The smaller mesh will reduce the mesh and step voltages at the perimeter of\nthe grid.  The resulting unequally sized mesh throughout the grid violates one of the\nassumptions of the simplified design equations.\n2. Divert fault current to alternative paths.  Diverting fault current is generally accomplished by\nensuring that all power line overhead shield wires that enter the substation are connected to the\nground grid.  The split factor calculated according to Section 9.5.2 assumes that all shield\nwires have already been connected to the grid.  Using larger shield wires or shield wires of a\nhigher conductivity may divert additional fault current.  For very small substation sites with\nhigh soil resistivities, this may be the only method that will bring the grid design into\nconformance with the safety criteria.\n3. If a two-layer soil model indicates that the bottom soil layer has a lower resistivity than the\nupper soil layer and lies deeper than 3.05 meters (10 feet), use longer ground rods to reach the\nlower resistivity layer.\n4. At a site with high-resistivity soil, drill a well and use it as a point of low resistance.\nIf all the above methods fail to obtain a grid design with safe mesh and step voltages, study and apply the\nfollowing modifications where appropriate.\n1. Supplementing the grid conductors with deeply placed electrodes.  This is required where the\nearth in which the grid conductors are buried is of resistivity too high to economically achieve\na satisfactory resistance to remote earth.  Such a situation may occur because of the natural\ncharacter of the earth.  High earth resistivity may also be seasonal because of the earth’s\ndrying out or becoming frozen.  A decision on application of electrodes should necessarily be\nconservative because of the probabilistic nature of the problem.  Seriously consider\napplication of deep electrodes wherever relatively high resistivity in shallow earth will be\nexperienced.\nRods are the most commonly used electrodes.  Other types of electrodes, such as ground wells,\nare also used.\n2. Use of soil additives and treatments to increase the soil conductivity by reducing the resistivity\nof the soil.  Refer to clause 14.5 of IEEE Std. 80 for additional information.\n3. Use of wire mats.  It is feasible to combine both a surface material and fabricated mats made\nof wire mesh to equalize the gradient field near the surface.

These cases included square, rectangular, triangular, T-shaped, and L-shaped grids.  Cases\nwere run with and without ground rods.  The total ground rod length was varied with different numbers of\nground rod locations and different ground rod lengths.  The area of the grids was varied from 6.25 to\n10,000 m2 (67.27 to 107,639.10 ft2).  The number of mesh openings along a side was varied from 1 to 40.\nThe mesh size was varied from 2.5  to 22.5 meters (8.2 to 78.8 feet).

Proper grounding calculations and grid design should result in acceptable touch and step\npotential voltages without the additional grounding platform grounding.  However, since the\noperation of the switch places the operator directly at risk when a substation fault occurs,\nadditional precautions are needed.  This includes adding switch grounding platforms and a 3-\nto 6-inch layer of clean crushed rock that covers the entire area inside the substation fence and\nextends 3 to 4 feet outside the substation fence to reduce the risk of electric shock.\n2. Switch grounding platform grounding is added to minimize the voltage between the switch\noperator’s hands and feet in the event of a fault at the switch during manual operation.\n3. The basic methods to minimize the hand-to-foot voltage at the switch handle include the\nfollowing:\na. Minimize the current that flows in the conductor that connects the equipment grasped by\nthe hand and the surface that is stood on.\nb. Minimize the resistance of the electrical connection between the hands and feet.\nThe grounding platform should be connected to the operating handle by a copper cable that connects to\nthe operating handle and the grounding platform as shown in Figure 9-37."

With no\nother ground cable connection to the grounding platform, minimal current will flow through the\noperator’s body to the platform since it will be insulated from the earth and conductor because of the\nsurface rock.  The hand-to-foot voltage will be minimized and closely maintained with this connection.\nThe grounding platform area needs to be kept clean of contamination and vegetation.  If the grounding\nplatform conductor to the switch handle breaks, then the contamination or vegetation touching the\ngrounding platform can result in the grounding platform’s potential being close to that of the ground grid,\nwhich is a less safe situation.\nThe design engineer should be familiar with the application of switch handle grounding and operator\nplatform grounding by utilizing the latest available standard and publications including RUS document\nupdates on this subject.  The engineer also should develop a safety procedure checklist regarding all\ngrounding aspects of the switch operator handle for the utility maintenance crew to follow before\nattempting to operate the switch.\n9.10.10.3  Metallic Cable Sheaths:   Metallic cable sheaths in power cable have to be effectively\ngrounded to prevent dangerous voltages resulting from insulation failure, electrostatic and\nelectromagnetic induction, flow of fault current in the sheath, and voltage rise during fault current flow in\nthe substation ground system to which the sheaths are connected.  Cable sheaths should be grounded at\ntwo or more locations: at cable terminations and at splices and taps.  Control cable shields are not\nintended to carry significant current and thus should only be grounded at one end.  Where any cable\nsheath may be exposed to excessive ground current flow, a parallel ground cable should be run and\nconnected to both ends.  IEEE Std. 80 provides more information on metallic cable sheath grounding.\n9.10.10.4  Surge Arrester Grounding:  Surge arresters are designed to pass surge energy from\nlightning and switching transients to ground and so are frequently subjected to abnormal current flow to\nground.  They have to be reliably grounded to ensure protection of the equipment they are protecting and\nto minimize high potential gradients during operation.\nThe surge arrester grounds should be connected as close as possible to the ground terminals of the\napparatus to be protected and have as short and direct a path to earth as practical.  Arrester leads should\nbe as free from sharp bends as practical. The tanks of transformers and steel or aluminum structures may\nbe considered as the path for grounding arresters, provided effective connections can be made and\nsecure multiple paths are available.  Where there can be any question regarding the adequacy of these\npaths, it is recommended that a separate copper conductor(s) be used between the arrester ground terminal\nand the substation grounding grid.\n9.10.11  Investigation of Transferred Voltage\nTransferred voltage contact may be considered a special case of the “touch” contact.  A potential hazard\nmay result during a ground fault from the transfer of potentials between the ground grid areas and outside\npoints by conductors such as communication circuits, low-voltage neutral wires, conduit, pipes, rails,\nmetallic fences, etc.  A person standing within the substation touches a conductor grounded at a remote\npoint, or a person standing at a remote point touches a conductor connected to the substation grounding\nsystem.  Here, the shock voltage may be essentially equal to the full voltage rise of the grounding system\nunder fault conditions and not the fraction of this total that is encountered in the usual “step” or “touch”\ncontacts."

Low-voltage cables are defined as those operating at 600 volts and below,\nhigh-voltage as those operating above 600 volts, and special cables as those operating in the radio\nfrequency spectrum, i.e., 30 kHz and above.\nSee ANSI/IEEE Std. 525, “Guide for Selection and Installation of Control and Low-Voltage Cable\nSystems in Substations,” for additional data on substation cables.\n10.2 600-VOLT CABLE\n10.2.1  Circuit Requirements\nCircuits of 600 volts can be divided into two main categories:  power circuits and control circuits.\nSubstation power circuits are those supplying power to cooling fans, insulating oil pumps, air\ncompressors, apparatus heaters, luminaires, and similar three-phase and single-phase loads.  Voltage\nlevels and connections vary depending on the application.  These can be:\n1. 480/240 volt, three-phase delta connected\n2. 480/277 volt, three-phase wye connected\n3. 208/120 volt, three-phase wye connected\n4. 240 volt, three-phase delta connected\n5. 240/120 volt, three-phase closed or open delta connected with one phase center-tapped\n6. 240/120 volt, single-phase three-wire\nThe relative merits of these six alternatives are covered in detail and illustrated in Chapter 15, AC and DC\nAuxiliary Systems.\nSubstation control circuits are those that execute a command to and/or indicate the status of a piece of\napparatus such as a circuit breaker.  Control circuits also include those concerned with currents and\nvoltages for relaying and similar purposes.  These circuits usually operate at less than 300 volts and may\nbe dc or ac.  Typical examples are current and potential circuits for protective relays and metering\ndevices, and trip or close commands to automatic protective devices.  Communication and supervisory\ncontrol and data acquisition (SCADA) system circuitry fall under the category of control circuits.\nIn spite of the usually lower voltage level of control circuitry, a minimum insulation level of 600 volts\nshould be specified.  Cable of 600 volts is more readily available than 300-volt cable, and the small, if\nany, price differential is generally not an equitable trade for the additional protection provided by the\n600-volt insulation.  An exception to the above rule may be a requirement of several thousand feet of low-\nvoltage (48-volt) circuitry.  In this instance, consider 300-volt insulation as a possible economic\nadvantage."

Because of the lower termination reliability and lower ampacity of aluminum, copper is\ngenerally preferred.\nPower circuit conductors should be No. 12 AWG minimum size.  Stranded conductors are easier to\nhandle and lend themselves to compression or bolted lugs and connectors.  RUS Bulletins 50-71, “RUS\nSpecification for 600 V Underground Power Cable,” and 50-30, “RUS Specification for 600 V Neutral-\nSupported Secondary and Service Drop Cables,” contain information on 600-volt power cables.\nControl circuit conductors, because of low ampacity requirements, are often smaller than No. 12 AWG.\nStranding can be such as to permit flexibility.  A typical No. 12 AWG control conductor could be made\nup of 19 strands of No. 25 AWG copper whereas a power conductor would be made up of 7 strands of\nNo. 19 AWG.\nStranding of individual conductors is basically concentric and rope stranding.  Concentric cable stranding\nis defined as a cable consisting of a central wire surrounded by one or more helically laid wires with the\nlay direction the same for all layers.  A rope-stranded cable consists of groups of concentric cables.\nConcentric cable has a more nearly circular cross section, permitting the best centering of the conductor\nwithin the insulation.  General-use 600-volt cable is manufactured concentric strand.  Rope-stranded\npower cable is available as flexible and extra flexible, and the cost is such as to preclude use for 600-volt\ncircuits.  An exception would be the use of very short lengths of a large-diameter cable, where the\nflexibility makes termination easier, or where excessive conductor movement is inevitable.  Avoid such\nsituations if possible.\n10.2.3  Conductor Configurations\nInsulated conductors are manufactured as single- or multi-conductor cables, shielded or non-shielded, and\nwith or without armor.\nControl circuit conductors are usually specified as multi-conductor cables.  This has the basic advantage\nof one specific multi-conductor circuit laying in one place instead of several places.  This could be the\ncase with a four-conductor current transformer circuit.\n10.2.3.1  Color Coding :  Control circuit multi-conductor cables can be purchased with all wires\ncolored black or the wires color coded.  Color coding should be by the Insulated Cable Engineers\nAssociation (ICEA) methods.\nColored insulation compounds with tracers repeated in regular sequence (color coding) is the most widely\nused method.  Color coding methods are specified in ICEA Publication S-73-532/NEMA WC57, and the\ncolor coding sequence shown in Tables E-1 and E-2 of that publication may be used, depending on the\napplication.  Table E-1 is used when the installation is not required to meet NEC  requirements.  Table E-2\ncan be used for all installations, including those required to meet the NEC .  The preferred method is\nTable  E-2, which is reproduced as Table 10-1.\nColor coding for substation control circuits, even single conductor circuits, is recommended.  Standard\ncodes can be established for circuit functions and individual wire functions.  For example, a blue wire\nstandardized as a “trip” wire and a red wire standardized as a “close” wire for power circuit breaker\ncontrol duplicates the color practice for pilot lights on control panels indicating breaker status.

For grounding methods that have been found to be effective in shielding control cables,\nalso see Chapter 9.\n10.2.4  Conductor Insulation and Jackets\nInsulation is a very important parameter in wire or cable selection.  Base insulation selection on the\nproperties of life, dielectric characteristics, resistance to flame, mechanical strength and flexibility,\ntemperature capability, and moisture resistance.  Insulation types applicable to substation conductors are:\n• Ethylene Propylene Rubber EPR\n• Cross-Linked Polyethylene XLPE\n• Tree Retardant Cross-Linked Polyethylene TR-XLPE\nThe Oxygen Index (O.I.) of a plastic-insulated wire or cable is a measure of the fire propagation\nresistance of the material as determined by the Fire Test of ANSI/IEEE Std. 422.  Air normally contains\n21 percent oxygen; hence, a material with an oxygen index below 21 will burn readily in air.  A cable O.I.\nof 27 or greater is generally high enough to pass the IEEE Fire Test.\nTable 10-2 lists the basic properties of the insulating materials under consideration.\nTable 10-2:  Properties of Cable Insulating Materials\nMaterialMax.

Economic judgment should also be exercised as to\nstandardization.\nThe National Electrical Code (NEC)  contains tables showing temperature ratings and location restraints\nof insulation.  The design engineer should also use the wealth of information available to him from cable\nmanufacturers’ data.\nJackets are used over individual insulated wires or over multi-conductor cables to provide protection\nagainst mechanical damage, sunlight exposure, moisture, oil, acids, alkalis, and flame.  Some insulating\nmaterials used on single-conductor circuits, notably lighting circuits, have the required protection without\nthe use of additional jackets.  An example is NEC  Type TW, which is a 60 °C, flame-retardant, moisture-\nresistant thermoplastic insulation suitable for conduit, tray, or trench installation.\nJacket materials currently in use on 600-volt cables are Polyethylene and Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC).\nOther jacket materials are also commercially available."

Voltage drop is a\nsecondary factor except for current transformer circuits, tripping circuits, and long conductor runs.  Check\nfor voltage drop of the longest circuit, using the conductor size and the current capacity dictated.\nManufacturers’ data usually include voltage drop tables.  Where such data are unavailable, calculate the\nvoltage drop.  The voltage drop in a conductor should not be large enough to cause faulty operation of the\ndevice being fed by the conductors.  For power circuits, a 3 to 5 percent loss is tolerable with reasonable\nregulation.  Electric motors are generally rated for satisfactory operation at ±10 percent voltage; electric\nheating elements will operate satisfactorily within the same range.  If any doubt exists, contact the\nequipment manufacturer to determine voltage tolerances applicable.\nAlso consider voltage drop in current transformer circuits.  As can be seen from Figure 10-l, with a C400\ntransformer, No. 14 AWG leads are required.  With a C200 transformer, No. 9 AWG leads are required.\nIn other words, calculate current transformer circuit voltage drop to select a cable size that allows the\ncurrent transformer ratio error to remain within acceptable limits.  Given a certain current transformer\nclass furnished with equipment, the leads have to be sized for the given current transformer.  A C200\ncurrent transformer can maintain 200 volts across the secondary terminals and hold the ratio error within\n10 percent when 20 times full load current is applied.\nConductor selection based on current-carrying capacity is made by computing the current required to\nserve the load.  The wire or cable is selected from applicable Articles of the NEC  or from manufacturers’\ndata.  This applies to both control and power conductors.  The NEC  contains examples of branch and\nfeeder circuit size calculations.\nThe current-carrying capacity of a given size conductor is not a constant.  The ampacity varies depending\non the installation condition.  Conductors for use in free air are rated higher than those in conduit.  More\nthan three conductors in a conduit also lowers the current-carrying capacity of each individual conductor.\nIn general, conductor insulation short-circuit capability for 600-volt substation service need not be\nconsidered.  As an example, No. 9 AWG copper with XLPE insulation may carry up to 5000 amperes for\n2 cycles without conductor failure.\nThe cooperative should establish standard conductor sizes for the cooperative’s particular system, for\nexample, 4/c No. 9 for current transformer circuits, 5/c No. 12 for potential circuits, 8/c or 10/c No. 12 for\nmultipurpose control, and 1/c No. 12 for miscellaneous relay interconnections, etc.  Standardization can\nresult in cost savings through quantity purchases and, if standard sizes are stocked, long lead times for\nmaintenance work can be eliminated.\n10.2.6  Segregation of Control Cables\nLow-voltage circuits providing instrumentation and control functions in a substation are subject to\nfailures and damage.  The installation of these circuits to minimize damage, upon failure, to adjacent\ncircuits is one of the prime concerns in substation design.  The cooperative should decide, based on\noperating history, the substation voltage level where such damage may result in reduced reliability."

If this is not possible,\nmaintain maximum physical separation.\ni. Isolate primary protection circuits from secondary circuits or backup circuits.\nSegregation of control cables also simplifies original circuit testing, maintenance procedures, and\nsubstation additions and constitutes “good housekeeping.”\nFrom these suggested guidelines and from operating history, the cooperative can establish control cable\nsegregation standards for its system.  All substations on a system should be the same, promoting ease of\ntesting and maintenance and possibly an increase in reliability.\n10.2.7  Installation Considerations\nCable failures occurring during precommission testing and/or shortly after substation service has begun\ncan often be traced to insulation failure caused by construction abuse or design inadequacy.  Insulation\ncan be damaged by excessive pulling tension during construction.  Conduit elbows selected with too\nsmall a radius could result in insulation flattening during installation.\nBending radius for general-use power and control cables is dependent on insulation type, number of\nconductors, size of conductors, and shielding.  The cooperative should establish standards for its system\nbased on cable manufacturers’ recommendations.\nCable damage can also occur through the entry of moisture at an unsealed end.  When a cut is made from\na reel, seal the reel end against moisture.  Seal cable ends prior to connections.  Lugs for use in moist\nlocations should be shrouded type.\nConstruction specifications should state that unlagged reels are not to be handled by lift trucks.  Properly\nstore cable at all times to prevent damage.  Common-sense handling by concerned personnel can prevent\ncable damage both in storage and in the field.\nConstruction specifications should also require the following:\na. Wherever possible, cables need to be run from outdoor equipment to the control house without\nsplices.\nb. Control cable splices should be made indoors at least 5 feet above the floor.\nc. Taps and splices in trays should not be buried under other cables.\nd. Splices should never be buried in earth or pulled in conduits or ducts.\ne. Wires, splices, and taps in metal junction boxes should never be under cover pressure.  An\nadequately sized box should be specified.\nf. Specifications and layouts should be designed to avoid sharp corners and also to provide\nadequate space for pulling cables into place with a minimum of rigging.\nWhere relatively large conductors, #1/0 and above, are used in three-phase circuits, and the quantity\njustifies it, consider ordering three or four conductors on a single reel.  Such a consideration is an obvious\ninstallation labor-saving decision."

Medium-voltage cables have solid extruded dielectric insulation and are rated from 1,000 to\n35,000 volts.  These single- and multiple-conductor cables are available with nominal voltage ratings of 5,\n8, 15, 25, and 35 kV.  Figure 10-2 illustrates the typical construction of medium-voltage shielded power\ncable.  RUS Bulletin 50-70, “RUS Specification for 15 kV and 25 kV Primary Underground Cable,”\ncontains additional information on 15 kV and 25 kV power cable.\nFigure 10-2:  Construction of Shielded Power Cable\n10.3.2  Conductors\nMedium-voltage power cable may be copper or aluminum with either a solid or stranded cross section.\nThe primary benefit of stranded conductors is improved flexibility.  Stranded conductors can also be\ncompressed, compacted, or segmented to achieve desired flexibility, diameter, and load current density.\nFor the same cross-sectional area of a conductor, the diameter differs among solid and the various types\nof stranded conductors.  This consideration is important in the selection of connectors and in methods of\nsplicing and terminating.  For the most part, stranded conductors are used almost exclusively for medium-\nvoltage power cable.\n10.3.3  Conductor Shield\nThe conductor shield is usually a semi-conducting material applied over the conductor circumference to"

The shield prevents the dielectric field lines from being distorted by\nthe shape of the outer strands of the conductor.  This layer also provides a smooth and compatible surface\nfor the application of the insulation.\n10.3.4  Insulation\nA very important parameter in cable selection is the insulation.  Insulation selection should be based on\nservice life, dielectric characteristics, resistance to flame, mechanical strength and flexibility, temperature\ncapability, and moisture resistance.  Common insulation types applicable to medium-voltage cables are:\n• Ethylene Propylene Rubber EPR\n• Cross-Linked Polyethylene XLPE\n• Tree Retardant Cross-Linked Polyethylene TR-XLPE\nEPR and TR-XLPE are the most common insulating compounds for medium-voltage power cables.\nMinimum acceptable insulation thickness shall be as specified by the RUS Bulletin 50-70, “RUS\nSpecification for 15 kV and 25 kV Primary Underground Power Cable.” The NEC contains tables\nshowing temperature ratings and location restraints of insulation types.  Also use the wealth of\ninformation available from cable manufactures’ data.\nSince no single insulation material fulfills all requirements, engineering judgment is required for selection\nof insulation for medium-voltage cable.  Also factor in the economics of cable standardization.\n10.3.5  Insulation Shield\nThe insulation shield is a two-part system composed of an auxiliary and a primary shield.\nAn auxiliary shield is usually a semi-conducting nonmetallic material over the insulation circumference.\nIt has to be compatible with the insulation.  A commonly used auxiliary shield consists of an extruded\nsemi-conducting layer partially bonded to the insulation.  The primary shield is a metallic shield (wire or\ntape) over the circumference of the auxiliary shield.  It has to be capable of conducting the sum of\n“leakage” currents to the nearest ground with an acceptable voltage drop.  In some cases it also needs to\nbe capable of conducting fault currents.  The shield has several purposes:\n• Confine the electric field within the cable.\n• Equalize voltage stress within the insulation, minimizing surface discharges.\n• Protect cable from induced potentials.\n• Limit electromagnetic or electrostatic interference (radio, TV etc.).\n• Reduce shock hazard (see Chapter 9 for proper grounding of the shield).\n10.3.6  Jackets\nThe cable may have components over the insulation shielding system to provide environmental\nprotection.  This material can be an extruded jacket of synthetic material, metal sheath/wires, armoring, or\na combination of these materials. Selection of jacket material should be based on the conditions in which\nthe cable will be operated.  The following considerations should be taken into account:\n• Service life\n• Temperature capability"

Also factor in the economics of cable standardization.\n10.3.7  Cable Voltage Rating\nThe voltage rating of a cable is based, in part, on the thickness of the insulation and the type of the\nelectrical system to which it is connected.  General system categories are as defined by the Association of\nEdison Illuminating Companies (AEIC).\n10.3.7.1 100 Percent Level:  Cables in this category may be applied where the system is provided\nwith protection such that ground faults will be cleared as rapidly as possible, but in any case within 1\nminute. While these cables are applicable to the great majority of cable installations on grounded systems,\nthey may also be used on other systems for which the application of cables is acceptable, provided the\nabove clearing requirements are met when completely de-energizing the faulted section.\n10.3.7.2 133 Percent Level:  This insulation level corresponds to that formerly designated for\nungrounded systems.  Cables in this category may be applied in situations where the clearing time\nrequirements of the 100 percent level category cannot be met, and yet there is adequate assurance that the\nfaulted section will be de-energized in one hour or less.  They may also be used when additional\ninsulation thickness over the 100 percent level category is desirable.\n10.3.7.3 173 Percent Level:  Cables in this category should be applied on systems where the time\nrequired to de-energize a grounded section is indefinite.  Their use is also recommended for resonant\ngrounded systems.  Consult the cable manufacturer for insulation thickness.\n10.3.8  Conductor Sizing\nIn substation applications, the most important element of cable sizing is the current-carrying capacity that\nis required to serve the load.  Take into account both continuous and non-continuous loads and any\nemergency overload that the cable will be required to carry.  Voltage drop is a secondary factor in very\nlarge installations with long cable runs.  Check for voltage drop of the longest circuit, using the conductor\nsize and the current capacity indicated.  Manufacturers’ data include voltage drop tables.  Where such\ndata are not available, calculate voltage drop.  The voltage drop in a conductor should not be large enough\nto cause faulty operation of the device being fed by the conductors.  For medium-voltage circuits, 3 to\n5 percent regulation is generally tolerable with reasonable regulation.  If any doubt exists, contact the\nequipment manufacturer to determine the applicable voltage tolerances.\nConductor selection based on current-carrying capacity is made by computing the current required to\nserve the load.  Select the cable from the applicable articles of the NEC  and the manufacturers’ data.  The\ncurrent-carrying capacity of a given size conductor varies depending on the cable installation (in air,"

Make sure the correct articles and tables in the  NEC  are applied\nwhen sizing the cable for current-currying capacity for the cable installation being considered.\nAlso take into account the available three-phase and phase-to-ground fault current levels when selecting\nthe conductor size and shield requirements.  In some cases, the minimum size conductor determined by\nthe fault current level requirements would result in a larger conductor size than was determined by the\nload current-carrying requirements.\nAfter calculating the available fault current levels and time required to clear the fault, look at the cable\nmanufacturer’s data to determine the minimum size conductor and shield requirements for the application.\n10.3.9  Terminations and Splices\nCable terminations are required for cables 1 kV and above.  When shielded power cables are terminated\nand the insulation shield is removed, an abrupt change in the dielectric field results.  Consequently, there\nis a concentration of electrical stresses along the insulation surface at the point where the shielding ends.\nThese non-uniform stress concentrations can cause insulation breakdown and cable failure.\nTo prevent cable failure, the cable has to be terminated in such a way as to eliminate the non-uniform\nvoltage stresses.  This is accomplished by placing a stress cone over the cable insulation.  The stress cone\nhas to be prefabricated.\nShielded power cables terminated indoors or in a controlled environment require only a stress relief cone.\nWhen a cable is terminated outdoors, it is exposed to various contaminants, many of which are conductive\nand/or corrosive.  These contaminants may cause flashover or arcing from the insulated conductor to the\nnearest adjacent conductor.  This would result in degradation of the termination.  Therefore, extended\ncreep path is required in addition to stress relief when terminating shielded power cable outdoors.  This is\naccomplished by adding skirts to the termination to increase the creepage distance.\nSplices are mainly used when it is necessary to join two cables at manholes and pull boxes.  The basic\nconcept to be remembered in splicing two cables is that the cable splice is in fact a short piece of cable\nthat is fabricated in the field.  As such, the splice needs to have the same components as the cables.  For\nshielded cables, the design of the splice needs to be compatible with the cable materials and also provide\nthe continuation of each cable component in order to keep voltage stresses to a minimum.\nCurrently, prefabricated termination kits and splice kits are the preferred practice because of the savings\nin time and materials.\n10.3.10  Cable Segregation\nAccording to the NEC , medium-voltage power cables should be segregated from low-voltage power,\ninstrument, and control circuits.  See the applicable articles in the NEC  for additional information.\n10.3.11  Installation Considerations\nThe type of medium-voltage power cable selected should be suitable for all environmental conditions that\noccur in the area where the cable is installed.  Prior to purchase and the actual installation of the cable,\nconsider the following:"

Give special consideration to cable installed in areas where\nambient temperatures differ from these values.\n• Whether the cable is direct buried; installed in duct banks, below-grade conduits, or trenches;\nor installed in above-grade cable trays or conduits, the cable should be rated and UL approved\nfor the particular cable installation.  The cable should also be suitable for operation in wet and\ndry locations.  If in doubt about the application, consult the cable manufacturer.\n• The service life of the cable selected in most cases should be at least equal to the design life of\nthe substation.\n• Cables installed in cable trays or other raceway systems where flame propagation is of concern\nshould pass the UL Std. 1072 or ANSI/IEEE Std. 383 flame tests.\n• The cable should maintain its required insulating properties when exposed to chemical\nenvironments.\nCable failures occurring during pre-commission testing and/or shortly after substation service has begun\ncan often be traced to insulation failure caused by construction abuse or design inadequacy.  Insulation\ncan be damaged by excessive pulling tension or by exceeding the minimum bending radius during\nconstruction.  The bending radius depends on insulation type, number of conductors, size of conductors,\nand type of shielding. The cooperative should establish standards for the system based on the cable\nmanufacturers’ recommendations.\nCable damage can also occur through the entry of moisture at an unsealed end.  When a cut is made from\na reel, seal the reel against moisture.  Seal cable ends prior to termination.\n10.3.12  High-Voltage Power Cable (69 kV up to 230 kV)\nUnderground transmission cable usage in the United States is very small: less than 1 percent of overhead\nline mileage.  The highest underground cable voltage that is commonly used in the United States is 345\nkV, and a large portion of this cable is high-pressure fluid-filled pipe-type cable.  Extruded dielectric\ncables are commonly used in the United States up to 230 kV, with up to 500 kV in service overseas.\nUnderground transmission cable is generally more expensive than overhead lines.  Because of all the\nvariables (system design, route considerations, cable type, raceway type, etc.), it has to be determined\ncase by case if underground transmission cable is a viable alternative.  A rule of thumb is that\nunderground transmission cable will cost from three to twenty times the cost of overhead line\nconstruction.  As a result of the high cost, the use of high-voltage power cable for transmission and\nsubtransmission is generally limited to special applications caused by environmental and/or right-of-way\nrestrictions.  For this reason, few applications will be justified for the cooperative’s system.  If\nunderground transmission cable is going to be considered, an engineering study is required to properly\nevaluate the possible underground alternatives.\nSee EPRI’s Underground Transmission Systems Reference  Book  for additional information on high-\nvoltage power cable.\n10.4 SPECIALIZED CABLE\nSubstation cable in this category consists of coaxial cables for low-frequency (30 kHz to 500 kHz) use in\ncarrier communications and for ultra-high-frequency (300 MHz to 3 GHz) use in microwave systems."

Because of the low power requirements of carrier systems, cable\npower rating need not be considered.  The primary consideration is jacket material.  Some jackets contain\nplasticizers that, when exposed to weather, leach into the center insulator, seriously increasing power\nlosses and making replacement necessary in approximately five years.\nNon-contaminating jackets are available where the life of the jacket is 20 years or more.  The cost\ndifferential of a few cents per foot is worth the added reliability.\nTypical coaxial cable for carrier communication use is RG-213/U having a non-contaminating jacket and\nnominal Zo of 50 ohms, but, depending on the application, a different coaxial cable may be required.\nCoaxial cable for microwave communication (3.0 GHz and below) is a part of a more sophisticated\nsystem.  Losses and power rating should be taken into consideration.\nMicrowave coaxial cable, 50 ohms Zo, is available with air dielectric and foam dielectric.  Air dielectric\ncable, to prevent moisture entry, is pressurized with inert gas, usually nitrogen.  At a given frequency,\ncable with air dielectric has less attenuation than with foam dielectric, but the pressure system has to be\nmonitored.  Foam dielectric is the preferred cable.  The transmitter may have to be specified with power\nto overcome the cable attenuation, but this can be minimized with attention to equipment location and by\nkeeping coaxial leads short.  A detailed selection procedure for microwave cable is covered in\nmanufacturers’ handbooks.\nIf spectrum space below 3.0 GHz is unavailable, the cooperative wishing to use microwave\ncommunications may have to apply for a higher frequency.  Above 3.0 GHz, coaxial cables exhibit far too\nmuch attenuation for practical use, necessitating use of wave guides.  Wave guide application is beyond\nthe scope of this bulletin.\n10.5 RACEWAYS\n10.5.1  Function\nRaceways, in the form of conduits, trays, and trenches, are used in substations to provide protection and\nelectrical segregation of cables.\nHistorically, raceway materials evolved as materials evolved, brought on mainly by increasing labor\ncosts.  Steel conduit was followed by fiber and cement asbestos conduit.  The lower weight and easier\ntooling was the main advantage.  Block trenches and cast-in-place concrete trenches followed.  These\ntrenches, while about the same cost as concrete-encased ducts, reduce the potential for cable damage\nsince the cables are simply laid in the trench.  Precast concrete trench, knocked down for field assembly,\nthen became available.  Plastic conduit followed and is a stock item with many electrical suppliers.  Other\nmaterials for raceway use will likely appear on the market.\n10.5.2  Economics\nThe economics of a raceway system for a substation hinge on a cost/benefit ratio.  A balance between\nrequired reliability and the cost of such reliability should be established.\nThe design costs of various systems generally will not vary appreciably.  More design will be required for\nan underground duct system than would be required for precast trench for a large substation."

Circuit reliability can be continually\nthreatened by excavation.  Metallic armored cables can minimize this damage and potential personnel\nhazard but sacrifice the lower cost.\nMost control and power cables, with insulation suitable for any below-grade installation, are suitable for\ndirect burial.  However, without a surrounding case (conduit), the cables are subject to damage by\nburrowing animals.\nTrenches for direct-buried cables are shown in RUS Bulletin 1728F-806, “Specification and Drawings for\nUnderground Electric Distribution” drawings UR2 to UR2-2, UR2-3 to UR2-5, UR2-NT and UR2-ST\ninclusive.\nAdvantages\na.

Neutral corrosion is possible.\n10.6.2  Direct-Buried Conduit\nIn a small distribution substation, direct-buried nonmetallic conduit for control and power cable including\nlighting circuits should offer the most economical underground system or cost/benefit ratio.\nSelect non-metallic conduit with a wall thickness suitable for direct earth burial.  Procure fittings for the\nconduit, whether plastic, fiber, or cement asbestos, from the manufacturers of the conduit.  This will\nensure component compatibility.\nExcept for equipment risers, avoid conduit bends to limit cable pulling tension.  Pulling tension should be\nlimited to 454 kg (1000 lbs) when pulled with a basket grip.  Control cables with conductors No. 16\nAWG and smaller should be limited to 40 percent of this value or lower if recommended by the\nmanufacturer.\nIn the design phase, calculate conductor pulling tension using Equation 10-1:\nEquation 10-1\nWhere:\nT=Tension, in kilograms (pounds)\nl=Length of conduit run, in meters (feet)\nw=Unit weight of cable, in kilograms/meter (pounds/foot)\nf=Coefficient of friction (0.5) (f may be decreased by using pulling lubricants)\nUse this relation in the computation and compare the worst case to the maximum allowable tension.\nReduce excessive lengths with handholes or manholes to provide pulling points.\nUse Equation 10-1 to determine the pulling tension for a given conduit length.

Manholes or handholes may be required.\nc. Backfill material requires inspection as to suitability.\n10.6.3  Concrete Encased Conduit (Duct Bank)\nConcrete-encased duct bank is decreasing in popularity, giving way to cable trenches.  In spite of the\ngrowing popularity of cable trench use in substations, cases exist where duct banks have to be used, either\nwith or without concrete encasement.  Cases in point could include conduits passing under heavy traffic\nroads, posing a barrier to equipment movement, or blocking natural drainage.  Resolve this or similar\nsituations when determining the preferred raceway system.\nWhen several cables are placed in the same duct bank, the operating temperature of the inner cables could\nexceed the safe operating temperature of the cable insulation.  To prevent this situation, the current-\ncarrying capacity of the cable is de-rated, based on the NEC.  Make sure the correct articles and tables of\nthe NEC  are applied when determining the current-carrying capacity for concrete-encased duct bank\ninstallations.  The engineer can change the current-carrying capacity of the cable significantly by\nselecting different duct bank configurations and spacing, etc.\nThe ampacity values indicated in the NEC  tables were calculated as detailed in “The Calculation of the\nTemperature Rise and Load Capability of Cable Systems” by J.H. Neher and M.H. McGraph.  The NEC\nAmpacity Tables cover most applications, but if the duct bank configuration, spacing, etc., is not included\nin the NEC Ampacity Tables, calculate the duct bank ampacity of the cable by using the Neher and\nMcGraph method.  Either do the calculations by hand or use one of the many available computer\nprograms.\nTo determine the approximate duct bank ampacity of the cable, calculate it by multiplying the normal\nampacity or load of the cable by a position factor.  Figure 10-3 cites examples of these position factors.\nFor an underground installation, excavation work should be specified as called for in Chapter 6.  The\ndesigner should indicate a pitch of 10.2 centimeters per 30.5 meters (4 inches per 100 feet) for duct\ndrainage.\nThere are two types of duct bank:  built up and tier.  The built-up (monolithic) method consists of laying\nconduits on fabricated plastic spacers, sized to the conduit outside diameter and desired separation.  Base\nspacers allow for 7.6 centimeters (3 inches) of concrete below the bottom row of conduits (ducts).\nIntermediate spacers are placed on the top of the bottom and succeeding layers of ducts to the desired\nheight.  Spacers are placed on both sides of couplings, the couplings being staggered along the run.  When\nthe entire bank is constructed and inspected to ensure ducts are aligned and continuous, the entire duct\nbank is enclosed with machine-mixed concrete grout, usually a 1:6 mix.  The monolithic pour of the built-\nup method is usually used with very careful supervision of all steps to eliminate the faults prevented by\ntiering.  Figure 10-4 illustrates monolithic duct bank construction."

Trenches are becoming the most acceptable cable installation method,\nparticularly in large installations.\nCable trenches may be constructed in several ways.\n10.6.4.1  Block Construction:  If block construction is planned for a control house, economics may\nindicate block trench.  Core or solid, concrete or cinder block is satisfactory for cable trench.  Covers can\nbe fabricated from checkered plate aluminum or lightweight concrete.  Figure 10-6 illustrates suggested\nconstruction.\n10.6.4.2  Cast-in-Place Concrete Construction:  This form of trench construction can be justified in a\nlarge substation where many foundations are being constructed and the necessary tradesmen and materials\nare readily available.  Fabrication is similar to the block cable trench illustrated in Figure 10-6.\n10.6.4.3  Precast Concrete Trench:   Depending on manufacturing plant locations and related freight\ncost, precast trench may present an attractive alternative for a reasonably large installation.  Field labor\nshould be substantially lower than the block or cast-in-place options.  Precast trench is supplied with\nlightweight concrete covers in manageable lengths, depending on trench width.  Figure 10-7 shows a\ntypical design.  Transitions are also available for vehicular crossings and building entrances.\nA very high degree of layout flexibility is available to the engineer.  Direction changes are usually limited\nto 90 °, but, with the cable lay-in benefits, cable damage in construction should be nonexistent.  The\nengineer can, with different trench widths, lay out a complete trench system without costly manhole\nconstruction, also avoiding substation roadways.\nElectrical segregation cannot be as complete with a cable trench system as in a multiple-conduit duct bank\nsystem.  In general, cable trenches are constructed without bottoms or floors.  This is done to eliminate\nfloating or frost heaving with consequent possible misalignment.  Cables are placed on a 10.2- to\n15.2-centimeter (4- to 6-inch) bed of fine sand.  French drains can be placed at selected intervals to drain\nthe trench of stormwater.\nAdvantages\na. Cable is laid in.\nb. Cable replacement or addition is simplified.\nc. Expansion is unlimited.\nd. Electrical segregation is possible to a limited degree.\ne. Layout does not require manholes.\nf. A high degree of installation flexibility is possible."

Generally used in conjunction\nwith below-grade duct banks, a manhole serves as a pulling and splicing point for cable runs, as a point to\nturn a duct line, and as a place to provide contraction and expansion of power conductors.\nIn light of the high construction costs even with precast units, and the ease of design and substantially\nlower cost of a total trench design, details of manholes will not be considered in this guide.\n10.6.6  Handholes\nUnlike manholes, handholes have a definite place in substation design.

Threading is\nnot required.  Support requirements are outlined in the NEC .\n10.9.4  Metal Conduit\nMetal conduit comes in three types: electrometallic tubing (thin wall), galvanized steel (heavy wall), and\naluminum.\nThin wall is limited to 2 inches in diameter, and fittings are expensive.  The 2-inch size weighs\n0.21 kilograms per meter (0.14 pounds per foot) as compared to 4.9 kilograms per meter (3.3 pounds per\nfoot) for steel.  Gland-type fittings are available to provide weather tightness.\nGalvanized steel conduit, available in trade sizes from ½ to 6 inches, will provide the best mechanical\nprotection for control and power cables.  However, labor cost is high.  Cutting, threading, and bending\nrequire tools not usually owned by tradesmen.  The best application in a substation for this conduit is for\nserving lighting and convenience outlets with conduit clamped to structural members.  Outdoor fittings\nand luminaires are threaded for ½- and ¾-inch rigid conduit.  Aluminum conduit offers weight advantage\nin large sizes.  Additionally, if each phase is installed in a separate conduit, aluminum will not heat up as\nwill steel.  Aluminum conduit should not be installed below grade, either for direct burial or concrete\nencasement, because of possible corrosion damage."

This construction\nmethod is not recommended where ground is subject to severe frost movement.\n10.10  SUMMARY—OVERHEAD RACEWAYS\nWhere underground cable placement is not possible and substation control is sophisticated, cable tray\nanchored to the substation equipment supports and/or above-grade trestles should be considered.  The tray\ncould be selected to provide circuit segregation.  Grounding of non-current-carrying metal parts such as\nexposed cable tray is necessary and is covered in Chapter 9.\nIn the simplest temporary substation, plastic conduit would require the least labor time.  Under some\nconditions, the conduit could be installed on top of the site stone.\n10.11  RACEWAY MATERIALS\n10.11.1  Plastic\nPlastic conduit, as currently available, covers an extensive list of organic materials with a variety of wall\nthicknesses, degrees of flexibility, available lengths, diameters, and applications.\nFor duct types, characteristics, and applications, see the appropriate NEMA standard or manufacturers’\ndata.  This information should include the codes and standards met by the listed conduit types.\n10.11.2  Fiber\nFiber conduit is a smooth-bore duct made of wood pulp pressure felted on a rotating mandrel, dried, and\nvacuum impregnated with hard coal tar pitch.  The ends of 8-foot lengths are tapered, as are couplings.\nCutting can be done with a coarse-tooth hand saw, and a factory-quality taper is easily accomplished with\na tapering tool.\nThe material is manufactured with wall thickness for direct burial or concrete encasement.  Angle\ncouplings, bends, and offsets are available.  Adapters for joining to threaded steel, reducers, and caps are\nstock items with many distributors.\nManufacturers’ data and detailed installation instructions are easily obtained.\n10.12  RACEWAY SIZING\nRaceway sizing is an important parameter in substation design, particularly for a large installation.  When\nlaying out the underground system, it is important to visualize the station as it will be as expanded,\npossibly to the ultimate configuration.\nIn sizing individual conduits of the system, good practice indicates 40 percent maximum fill for each\nconduit.  This means the total cross-sectional area (over insulation) of all conductors in a conduit should"

As an example, a\n4-inch conduit has an internal area of 12.72 square inches; hence, at 40 percent fill, the total conductor\narea should not exceed 5.09 square inches.  This practice is allowed by the NEC  and refers to single ducts.\nIn the planning stages, the ultimate substation has to be visualized and duct banks sized to provide for all\nrequired cables, remembering that all substation control cables originate at the control house.  Duct exits\nshould be provided for ultimate requirements.\nIt was previously noted that underground duct bank application is decreasing in substation expansion and\nnew substation design, giving way to cable trenches.  When the uncertainties of below-grade duct bank\ndesign for a future expansion program are considered, cable trench becomes a viable alternative.\nThe NEC  outlines the sizing of cable tray.  The same article can be used as a guide for cable trench sizing.\nThe limits in the article can be exceeded within reason because the trench will be located outdoors with\nnormally lower ambient temperatures than for indoor tray.\n10.13  REFERENCES\nANSI/IEEE Std. 383, “Type Test of Class 1E Electric Cables, Field Splices and Connections for Nuclear\nPower Stations.”\nANSI/IEEE Std. 422, “Design & Installation of Cable Systems in Power Generating Stations.”\nANSI/IEEE Std. 525, “Guide for Selection and Installation of Control and Low-Voltage Cable Systems in\nSubstations.”\nASTM Std.

In general, there are two types of corrosion.  One is the general metal loss in which the\nentire surface of the metal exposed to the soil in a given area is corroded away.  Typical of this is the\ngeneral thinning of strands on a concentric neutral cable throughout the area.  The second type of\ncorrosion is localized or “pitting”-type corrosion. In this form, very local areas of metal are attacked while\nthe metal immediately adjacent remains untouched.  This type of corrosion can also be found on\nconcentric neutral cables.  It generally results in the breakage of many of the individual strands of the\nneutral, rendering it disconnected and either useless or significantly reduced.\nThe important difference between local pitting corrosion and general metal loss is that it takes very little\nmetal loss of the local pitting type of corrosion to cause a complete loss of continuity in a neutral wire or\nto penetrate a pipe wall or lead sheath.  Therefore, local pitting-type corrosion is more serious to the\npower industry.\nThe substation grounding grid corrosion is caused by an electrochemical reaction in the soil environment\ncalled a “galvanic cell” or sometimes a “corrosion cell.”  The galvanic cell is made up of three parts: the\nanode, the cathode, and the electrolyte.\nThe environment that we are talking about (soil, in this example) is called the electrolyte.  The electrolyte\nis defined as an ionic conductor.  In other words, it transfers or allows the transfer of ions.\nThe electrode at which chemical reduction occurs is called the cathode (positive current enters the\ncathode from the electrolyte).  The electrode at which chemical oxidation (corrosion) occurs is called the\nanode (positive current leaves the anode and enters the electrolyte).\nIt is necessary for the anode and the cathode to be connected together electrically to complete the\ncorrosion cell.  For a corrosion cell to function, there has to be an electrical potential between the anode\nand the cathode.\nThis electrical potential can result from a number of conditions.  Two of the most common corrosion cells\nencountered result from:\n1. Dissimilar metals in the same environment\n2. The same metal in dissimilar environments\n11.1.2  Dissimilar Metals\nWhen two dissimilar metals are placed in the same environ ment, there will be a difference in dc voltage"

The\ncurrent will be limited by the resistance between the structures in accordance with Ohm’s law and also by\nsurface films, which may greatly reduce the current and the rate of corrosion.  Another example of\ndissimilar metal corrosion would be an underground bare copper cable and a galvanized conduit buried in\nthe ground inside a substation.\nThere are other examples of dissimilar metal corrosion.\n11.1.2.1  Old Steel vs. New Steel:  When old steel is connected to new steel, the old steel actually acts\nas the cathode and the new steel acts as the anode.  See Figure 11-1.\nFigure 11-1:  Dissimilar Metal Corrosion—Old Steel vs. New Steel\n11.1.2.2  Stress Corrosion:   Areas of metal that are under stress (i.e., straight pipe that is bent for\nconstruction purposes) tend to be anodic compared to areas that are not under stress.\n11.1.3  Dissimilar Environments\nDifferences in dc potential along the ground grid conductors or concentric neutrals can be caused by\nvarying oxygen concentrations, different values of pH, or because the soil resistivity varies over a fairly\nwide range.  In this case, areas effected by corrosion may be at random locations that would have to be\nlocated.\nThere are other examples of dissimilar environment corrosion.\n11.1.3.1  Oxygen vs. No Oxygen:  One element that is very important in its effect on underground\ncorrosion is oxygen.  Either through its presence or its absence, oxygen is one of the primary causes of\nmetal deterioration underground.  As a result of soil compaction during backfill, the type of soil, or the\nsteel conduit being laid in the bottom of the trench, steel conduits often have less oxygen near the bottom\nof the pipe.  See Figure 11-2.\n11.1.3.2  Different Types of Soil from Location to Location:  Depending on the type of soil (sandy,\nclay, loam, etc.), the pipe may vary from anodic to cathodic.  This generally does not occur in smaller\nsubstations, but should be a consideration in larger substations.  See Figure 11-3."

The preliminary data should include the following items.\n11.2.1.1  Soil Resistivity Survey:  A soil resistivity survey at each proposed site is the necessary first\nstep, since the economic choices of materials and designs will vary with soil resistivity.  Once soil\nresistivities are known, decisions can be made regarding overhead or underground feeder construction,\nthe use of jacketed cable, and anodes or other cathodic protection against corrosion.\nFor soils of high resistivity (over 200 ohm-meter) where both grounding and cathodic protection are\ndifficult to accomplish, semiconducting jacketed cable may be the most effective.\nOne way to obtain this information would be using the four-pin method.  See Section 9.3 of this bulletin\nfor further information on soil resistivity.\n11.2.1.2  pH Survey:  A pH survey of each substation site should also be a part of any corrosion\nevaluation.  Soils seldom have a pH lower than 5 (acid) or greater than 8 (alkaline), where 7.0 is neutral.\nSoils with a pH of 5 and lower can contribute to severe corrosion and rapid deterioration of exposed\nmetals.  Acid soil conditions are usually limited to soils containing decomposed acidic plants and needles\nfrom coniferous trees.  Soils with a pH of 8 and above can contain a high concentration of dissolved salts\nresulting in a low soil resistivity.  Soils of this type are referred to as alkaline or calcareous.  Alkaline\nsoils are high in sodium and potassium, while calcareous soils are high in magnesium and calcium.\nAlkaline earth elements such as magnesium and calcium tend to form protective layers on ferrous metal\nsurfaces and are considered favorable environments for metals.\n11.2.2  Selection of Materials\nSelect materials to minimize dissimilar-metal corrosion effects due to buried copper and steel (or other\nmetals) in the same environment.  For example, the grounding system at any one substation location\nshould consist wholly either of copper or steel.  This is particularly important in corrosive soils such as\nthose with low values of earth resistivity (less than 20 to 30 ohm-meter).  No commonly used material can\nbe wholly immune to possible corrosion damage.  However, in the absence of a planned maintenance\nprogram to periodically determine the specific condition of ground grid conductors, the final choice of\nmaterial should consider the available, proven historical records of the materials under consideration.\nWhere buried steel such as steel anchor assemblies, piping, and conduit is of necessity connected to the\ncopper grounding grid for safety, the higher the ratio of steel-to-copper surface area, the less likely will be\nthe adverse effects of corrosion of the steel.  Where the copper grounding system is the only metal placed\nin the substation soil, be alert for possible interconnected steel in nearby line anchor assemblies, piping,\nwells, conduit, or oil or gas lines that may be inadvertently connected to the grounding system and subject\nto accelerated corrosion.  If such conditions exist, cathodic protection of the interconnected steel may be\nnecessary.  For large substations, a rectifier-type cathodic protection scheme may be required."

Avoid test locations close to parts of an existing ground mat or other buried metal.  See\nSection 9.3 of this bulletin for a full description of testing and analyzing resistivity.\n11.3.2  Soil Samples\nObtain soil samples at the approximate depth of the under ground structures in the substation.  These\nsamples can usually be obtained with a soil auger.  A pH reading can be taken immediately, or the soil\ncan be stored in an airtight container such as a plastic bag and the readings taken at a later time.  Lower\npH values generally indicate more corrosive soils.  These tests can be handled by a testing laboratory or\ndone in house using commercially available soil testing kits.\n11.3.3  Anode Locations\nSacrificial anodes, where used, should be placed:\n1. At locations of the lowest resistivity soil within or near the substation area\n2. At depths at least equal to those of the ground grid and/or other assemblies to be protected\n3. Three to six meters away from the buried bare con ductors or other assemblies, to the extent\nthat space allows\nUsual anode locations are at edges or corners of the ground grid, and at structures in low-resistivity\nlocations near the substation.  The connection from anode to the system neutral and station grid should be\nreliable and have low resistance.  Compression fittings or exothermic welded connections are preferable\nto bolted connections or clamps.\n11.3.4  Underground Connections\nExothermic welding is preferred to clamps or bolted connec tions for dissimilar-metal (copper-to-steel)\nconnections underground.  For similar metal, copper-to-copper or steel-to-steel (galvanized) connections,\nsuitable bolted or clamped connections with clamps of the same material should be satisfactory.  Cover\nwelds with mastic or other underground coating (such as used for pipelines) in very corrosive soils with\nresistivities in the range below 10 ohm-m.  In most soils this is not considered necessary.\n11.3.5  Estimating Corrosion Conditions from DC Potential Measurements\nOne frequently used indicator of corrosion or freedom from corrosion is the dc potential (voltage)\nmeasured from a copper–copper sulfate reference electrode or half-cell. This measurement is made as\nshown in Figure 11-4.\nThe copper–copper sulfate half-cell is a copper rod sur rounded by a saturated solution of copper sulfate\n(blue vitriol) in water, with a porous plug to allow the solution to come in contact with the soil.  The\nvoltmeter usually is a potentiometer (null-type) voltmeter or a special high-resistance (10 megohms or"

However, a useful reading may also be possible with a 20,000 ohm-per-volt\ndc meter with a 2.5-volt range.  See Figure 11-5.\nThe variations in dc potential are small and often expressed in millivolts.  Usually, the neutral is negative\nwith respect to the copper–copper sulfate half-cell.  Table 11-1 lists some typical potentials for metals and\ncombinations of metals that may be present and connected to a substation ground grid.\nTable 11-1:  DC Potentials of Various Buried Metals.\nBased on Hagan, “Basic Electrical and Corrosion\nFundamentals Involved in Pipeline Corrosion.”\nBuried Metal Typical Potential Volts\nZinc or new galvanized steel –1.1 or more negative\nSteel fully protected against corrosion –0.85 or more negative\nOld buried steel pipe –0.65\n“Copper-grounded” neutral with\nanchors and steel piping connected–0.50 to –0.65\nAll-copper grounded neutral –0.30\nDC potential measurements indicate the effectiveness of anodes for cathodic protection.  For example,\nanodes may be installed at a copper-grounded substation to relieve corrosion of anchor rods near the\nsubstation.  If the anodes are effective, the station ground grid becomes more negative.  The potential\nmight be shifted from –0.55 volt to –0.75 volt.  In a situation where original anchor rods have begun to\nfail after 15 years, such a change in poten tial should be adequate to ensure permanence of the newly\ninstalled anchors.  In very corrosive soils (such that anchor rods might otherwise fail in five years or less),\na shift to at least –0.85 volt may be needed for complete protection."

Relays are also used to detect abnormal or\nundesirable operating conditions other than those caused by defective equipment and either operate an\nalarm or initiate operation of circuit-interrupting devices.  Protective relays protect the electrical system\nby causing the defective apparatus or lines to be disconnected to minimize damage and maintain service\ncontinuity to the rest of the system.\n12.1.2  Design Objectives\nThe design objectives of a protective relaying are to minimize the effects of a system disturbance and to\nminimize the possible damage to power system equipment.  A good protective relaying system will\naddress dependability, security, speed, and simplicity.\n12.1.2.1  Dependability:   Dependability is the certainty of correct operation in response to system\ntroubles.  Dependability includes the reliable operation of the relay system operating when it is supposed\nto and selectivity of the relay system operating to isolate the minimum amount of the system necessary to\nprovide continuity of service.\n12.1.2.2  Security:   Security is the ability to avoid misoperations between faults.  Every relay system\nhas to be designed to either operate or not operate selectively with other systems.\n12.1.2.3  Speed:   Speed means clearing all faults in the shortest possible time with all due regard to\ndependability and security.\n12.1.2.4  Simplicity:   A relaying system should be no more complex than is required for any given\napplication.  Adding more equipment into a scheme than is necessary for good coverage adds to the\npossibility of equipment failure and misoperation.\n12.1.3  Indications of Defective Equipment or Abnormal Conditions\n12.1.3.1  Short Circuits:   A short circuit is an abnormal connection of relatively low resistance\nbetween two or more points of differing potential in a circuit.  If one of these points is at ground potential,\nit is referred to as a “ground fault.”  If ground potential is not involved, it is referred to as a “phase fault.”\nPhase faults cause excessive currents and low voltages.  Ground faults may or may not cause excessive\ncurrents or abnormal voltages, depending on whether the system is normally ungrounded, high- or low-\nresistance grounded, or effectively grounded.\n12.1.3.2  Excessive Heating:   Equipment is designed to deliver full-rated capacity with the\ntemperature maintained below a value that will not be damaging to the equipment.  If operating\ntemperature becomes excessive, the life of the equip ment (generator, motor, transformer, etc.,) will be"

Excessive heating may be caused by overloading, high ambient temperatures, improper cooling,\nor failure of cooling equipment.\n12.1.3.3  Overvoltage:   Equipment is designed for normal operating voltages as stated on its\nnameplate with a slight allowance (usually about 5 percent) for normal overvoltage.  Abnormal\novervoltage may cause:\n1. Insulation failure\n2. Shortening of the equipment life\n3. Excessive heating as a result of greatly increased excitation currents where electromagnetic\ndevices are used\n4. Excessive heating in resistors used in controls\n5. Failure of transistors and other electronic devices\n12.1.3.4  Undervoltage:  Continued undervoltage will likely cause overheating of motors and\ndropping out of contactors, and lead to the failure of electrical equipment.\n12.1.3.5  Unbalanced Phase Conditions:  On balanced three-phase systems with balanced three-phase\nloads, a sudden unbalance in the current or the voltages usually indicates an open or a partially shorted\nphase.  An unbalanced voltage condition is especially serious for three-phase motors because negative\nsequence currents can lead to considerable overheating within the motor.  On balanced three-phase\nsystems with single-phase loads, the loading on each phase may normally vary, depending on the\nmagnitude of each single-phase load.  However, it is desirable to keep this unbalance to a minimum to\nmaintain balanced voltages for three-phase loads.  Unbalanced conditions, which include single-phase and\ndouble-phase faults with or without ground, can be detected with the use of negative and zero sequence\nrelay elements.\n12.1.3.6  Reversed Phase Rotation:  Reversed phase rotation can occur after circuit changes have\nbeen made or during an open phase condition.  Reversed rotation of motors may cause considerable\ndamage to the facility driven by the motors, such as a conveyor.\n12.1.3.7  Abnormal Frequency:   Abnormal frequencies can occur when the load does not equal the\ngeneration.  The frequency may be above or below the system normal frequency.  Many facilities such as\nelectric clocks, synchronous motors, etc., are frequency sensitive.\n12.1.3.8  Overspeed:  Considerable mechanical damage can be done to generators and motors because\nof overspeed.  Excessive overspeed may cause parts of the generator or motor to be thrown for\nconsiderable distances, which is dangerous to personnel as well as to other facilities. Generators or series-\nconnected motors may reach dangerous overspeeds when loads are suddenly removed.\n12.1.3.9  Abnormal Pressure:   In electrical equipment, such as transformers, that use liquid as an\ninsulating fluid, high internal pressures can be created during internal faults.\n12.1.3.10  Abnormal Impedance:   Electrical equipment has impedance associated with it that either\nhas definite known values or values that may vary within a known range during known varying operating\nconditions.  These values are normally determined during the manufacture and installation of equipment.\nSubstantial deviations in the impedance of the equipment can indicate a failure of the equipment."

All the generators and rotating equipment on the system rotate at an rpm to maintain the\n60 hertz frequency.  As such, each machine on the electrical system maintains a relative position, or phase\nangle, with respect to every other machine on the system.  Once a machine exceeds a critical phase angle,\nit can no longer stay in phase with the system.  It is said to have moved out of step with the system, and\nhas to be removed from the system and resynchronized to the system in order to establish operation.  Out-\nof-step conditions are typically monitored through the use of impedance relays and set to trip or block the\ntrip of breakers in order to segment the system at predetermined locations based on system stability\nstudies.\n12.1.3.12  Excessive System Phase Angles (Synchronism Check):  The closing of a circuit breaker\non a system connects the electrical systems on either side of the circuit breaker.

If the voltage and phase angle differences across the breaker are too much, excessive currents can\nflow, resulting in a disturbance to the system, possibly damaging the breaker or adjacent rotating\nequipment.  Typically, the voltage and phase angle across the breaker are compared to confirm the\nsystems are within proper limits before the breaker is closed.\n12.2 FUNDAMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS\n12.2.1  Phasors\nA phasor is a complex number used to represent electrical quantities.  In protective relaying systems,\nphasors are used to aid in applying and connecting relays and for analysis of relay operations after faults.\nPhasor diagrams have to be accompanied by a circuit diagram.  The phasor diagram shows the magnitude\nand relative phase angle of the currents and voltages, while the circuit diagram shows the location,\ndirection, and polarity of the currents and voltages.\n12.2.2  Polarity\nThe relative polarities of a current transformer’s primary and secondary terminals are identified either by\npainted polarity marks or by the symbols “H1” and “H2” for the primary terminals and “X1” and “X2”\nfor the secondary terminals.  The convention is that, when primary current enters the H1 terminal,\nsecondary current leaves the X1 terminals.  Or, when current enters the H2 terminal, it leaves the X2\nterminal.  When paint is used, the terminals corresponding to H1 and X1 are identified.  Since ac current\nis continually reversing its direction, one might well ask what the significance of polarity marking is.  Its\nsignificance is in showing the direction of current flow relative to another current or to a voltage, as well\nas to aid in making proper connections.  The polarity marks for a potential transformer have the same\nsignificance as for a current transformer.\n12.2.3  Faults\nA system fault (short circuit) is a condition in which the electric current follows an abnormal path as a\nresult of the failure or removal of the insulation that normally confines the electric current to the\nconductors.  Insulation is usually either air or high-resistive material that may also be used as a\nmechanical support.  Air insulation can be accidentally short-circuited by birds, rodents, snakes, kite\nstrings, tree limbs, etc.; broken down by overvoltage due to lightning; or weakened by ionization due to a\nfire or smoke.  Organic insulation can deteriorate because of heat or aging or can be broken down by"

Porcelain insulators can be\nbridged by moisture with dirt or salt, or can develop a crack as a result of mechanical forces.\n12.2.4  Symmetrical Components\nSymmetrical components are the foundation for obtaining and understanding fault data on three-phase\npower systems.  Formulated by Dr. C.L. Fortescue in a classic AIEE paper in 1918, the symmetrical\ncomponents method was given its first application to system fault analysis by C.F. Wagner and R.D.\nEvans in the late 1920s and early 1930s.  W.A. Lewis added valuable simplification in 1933.  Today, fault\nstudies are commonly made with a digital computer.  System changes can be accurately modeled and\nincorporated into the database.  Knowledge of symmetrical components is important both in making a\nstudy and in understanding the data obtained from the computer.  It is also extremely valuable in\nanalyzing faults and relay operations.  A number of protective relays are based on symmetrical\ncomponents.  Symmetrical components are one of the most powerful technical tools used by a relay\nengineer.  The practical value lies in the ability to think and visualize in symmetrical components.\nSeveral good courses on symmetrical components are available from manufacturers.  The relay engineer\nshould become well acquainted with the use of symmetrical components since it is a primary means of\ncommunicating about and analyzing system faults.\n12.2.5  Relay Input Sources\nInstrument transformers provide relays with currents and voltages that are proportional to voltage and\ncurrents flowing in the primary circuit.  Voltage signals are obtained from potential transformers ( PTs)\nand current signals from current transformers ( CTs).  Instrument transformers and their applications are\ndescribed in Section 5.10.\n12.3 BASIC RELAY TYPES\n12.3.1  General\nProtective relays consist of three basic modules:\n1. An input module\n2. A decision module\n3. An output module\nSee Figure 12-1.  The modules are each constructed of components that will vary depending on the type\nof construction of the relay: electromechanical, static, or microprocessor.\nFigure 12-1:  Logical Representation of Protective Relays\nRelays are also classified according to the function they provide to the system.  The five most common\nfunctions are:"

Other functions are included as applicable.\nEach of the basic relay modules operates to perform tasks as follows.\n12.3.1.1  Input Module:   The principal input module task is to receive the inputs from the electrical\nsystem to the relay, generally in the form of currents, voltages, and status input contacts. It acts as the\ninterface between the relay decision module and the electric power system, protecting the sensitive\ndecision module from the harsh environment of the electric power system.  The electrical system input\nsection typically consists of transformers, transactors, zener diodes, electronics, and other equipment to\nprovide a signal, proportional to the inputs, to the decision module.  The input equipment will condition\nthe input signals to be in a format required by the decision module.  Conditioning may include converting\nthe voltage, contact, or current inputs into voltages or currents suitable to electronic equipment.\nConditioning may also include the conversion of the signals from analog values to digital values.  The\ninput section also will typically contain equipment that will provide protection for the relay to withstand\nthe surges, transients, and oscillations that may be present in the substation environment.\nAn additional task of the input section of the relay is to provide for the input and storage of the relay\nsettings.  For electromechanical and static relays, this is most often the setting of various taps, dials\n(which will normally preset tension on a spring), and selector switches on the face of the relay.  For\nmicroprocessor relays, the input section often includes a series of push buttons that will allow the input of\nrelay settings or the input of requests for the relay to display settings or data processed by the relay.  The\nrelay settings will be stored for use by the relay in providing its protective functions.\nMicroprocessor relays often include a number of additional inputs to the relay.  Included in these inputs\nare the power supply; clock signals to provide sequence of events (SOE) timing; communication ports to\nprovide direct computer, SCADA, or other data inputs; and front panel push buttons to set the relay or\nscroll through the metering functions.  Microprocessor relays are often provided with multiple relay\nsetting groups that will allow for changes in the electric power system configuration.  The change from\none settings group to another can usually be keyed locally by an external contact in the substation control\nscheme or remotely via SCADA.  It should be noted that there is an inherent danger of inadvertently\nchanging a relay setting or setting group with this type of microprocessor relay.\nThe relay engineer has to be aware of the electrical system inputs that are available for use in determining\nthe failure of the electric power system or electric power system components.  Knowledge of the electric\npower system and how the system responds to various failures is invaluable in making decisions as to the\ntypes of relays that are used to protect the electric power system.\n12.3.1.2  Decision Module:   This module monitors the input data included in the relay settings input to\nthe relay and the system data, including currents, voltages, status contacts, and control signals that were\ninput to the relay.  The module will evaluate the system data in comparison to the relay settings.  When\nthe system data exceed the threshold determined by the relay settings, this module will signal the output\nmodule to function and record the results.  The quantities to which the relay responds usually designate\nthe relay type."

Each of the units is configured with a contact that either makes (closes) or\nbreaks (opens) upon the operation of the device.  The recording of the action is usually accomplished by\nthe dropping of a target to indicate the relay operation.  The module compares the input relay settings to\nthe input signals through the inherent magnetic or thermal action of the relay to overcome the spring\ntensions and inertia associated with the relay settings.  Relays may operate (1) instantaneously, (2) with\nsome definite time delay, or (3) with a time delay that varies with the magnitude of the quantities to which\nthe detecting element responds.\nStatic relays replace the electromechanical components with solid-state components and make the\ncomparisons by electronic means. Static or solid-state detecting elements generally convert the current,\nvoltage, or power inputs to proportional dc millivolt signals that are then applied to adjustable transistor\namplifiers.  These amplifiers have a “go–no go” characteristic that causes an input signal up to the set\nlevel to produce no output and input signals beyond that level to produce full output.  The output may be\nanother dc millivolt signal applied to further transistor logic or to a contact closure.  Indication of the\noperation of the relay is usually accomplished by the dropping of a target to indicate the relay operation.\nMicroprocessor relays replace the decision module with a small digital computing unit that utilizes\nsampled input data and digitized setting parameters.  Comparisons are made digitally by the computer\nperforming a calculation or series of calculations, comparing the relay setting information to the periodic\nsamples obtained from the electric power system.  When the threshold values are exceeded, the module\nactivates the output module.  Most relays will also store a number of metering values, the status of input\ndevices, intermediate logic elements, and other information available to the relay in output storage\nregisters.  The information is then available for retrieval by the engineer at his convenience, either locally\nat the substation or remotely through communications that are often provided to the relay.\nMicroprocessor relays usually include internal self-checking functions for the majority of their functions.\nShould a failure occur within the logic of the relay, an alarm will be given to the relay output module that\nthe relay is in an alarm condition.  The relay engineer also needs to be aware of the functions and features\nthat may not be covered by an alarm, such as the capability of the output relays to function.\n12.3.1.3  Output Module:   This module provides an output from the decision module to the control\nsystem in order to operate electric power system equipment and isolate faulty system components.\nFor electromechanical relays, this system typically consists of output contacts or auxiliary relays with\nmultiple contacts.  The contacts act as the interface between the relay and the electric power control\nsystem.  These contacts are then used to trip circuit breakers, provide alarms, trip other relays such as\nlockout relays and send signals via communications to remote equipment or personnel, or other functions.\nThe contacts will carry specific ratings for the voltages and currents they will successfully carry or break.\nStatic relays provide the option for outputs to be either auxiliary reed (magnetically activated) relays and\ntheir associated contacts or solid-state-controlled thyristors. Electronically controlled thyristors are\nusually faster than their relay counterparts.  Triggering circuitry may include opto-isolators to provide\nisolation between the relay and the harsh environment of the electric control system.\nMicroprocessor relays will use either reed relays or solid-state-controlled thyristors for output elements.\nUsage will vary between manufacturers and may be optional to the user.

Most relays include a number of output storage registers where the relay stores a number\nof metering values, the status of input devices, intermediate logic elements, and other information\navailable to the relay.  The information is then available for retrieval by the engineer at his convenience,\neither locally at the substation or remotely through communications that are often provided to the relay.\nMost microprocessor relays include communication capabilities that allow the relay to transmit data in\ndigital format to computers, SCADA systems, or local control systems.\nMany microprocessor relays also include a display unit as a part of the output module.  This display unit\nis typically used to display metering values of the inputs that are brought to the relay or metering\ninformation that is calculated in the relay.  The display may also show other functions of the relay, such\nas the display of internal variables, flags, and input parameters.  The display typically provides a means of\ngetting information out of the relay without the requirement to connect a computer to one of the output\nports.\n12.3.2  Relay Selection\nThe type of relay selected by the relay engineer for an application is of primary importance.  The engineer\nhas to determine, with existing system knowledge or with additional studies, the types of failure that each\ncomponent of the electric power system can experience and the characteristics of the failure.  The\nelectrical system inputs that will be available to the relay and the speed with which the relay has to\noperate to maintain electrical system stability has to be known.  With this information, the engineer can\napply relays that will measure the identified characteristics of the electric power system component with\nthe previously established relay settings and operate dependably and securely in protecting the electrical\nsystem.  The relay engineer should consider some of the following factors.\n12.3.2.1  Electromechanical relays are the oldest and have the most history associated with them.  They\nprovide discrete protection functions within each case.  Relay settings are usually straightforward and\nwell documented in most instruction books.  The relay engineer has to have a relatively good idea of the\nmagnitudes of electrical signals that will be applied to the relay in order to obtain the proper range of\nsettings for each application.\n12.3.2.2  Static relays generally provide discrete functions similar to electromechanical relays.  Since\nthe operation of the relays depends only on threshold values being met, these relays are generally faster\nthan their electromechanical counterparts.  Static relays often come in cases similar to their electro-\nmechanical counterparts, making replacement relatively simple.  Static relays are also available in\n“packages” that include all the protective functions for the line in a single rack.\n12.3.2.3  Microprocessor relays often can accommodate more complex system operation because of\nthe inputs provided to the relay and the programming features included with the relay.  In many cases,\nnumerous functions are provided in the relay so that the number of discrete relays required for protection\nmay be reduced substantially.  In many cases, additional functions may be provided to protect a system\nfrom abnormal conditions that might not otherwise be considered based on the low occurrence of such\nconditions or because of other considerations.\n12.3.2.4  Microprocessor relays often provide the relay engineer with many more options for providing\nprotection than either their electromechanical or static relay counterparts.  Once the inputs to the relay are\nobtained, the decision module can then be programmed to provide many protective functions with these\ninputs.  This information can also be used to implement the transmittal of data remotely through SCADA"

In terms of the number of functions, the microprocessor relay will often\nprovide more protective functions for the dollar spent.\nThis type of relay may be slightly slower to operate than some of the electromechanical or static relays\nthat are available.  The operating speeds of microprocessor relays are typically in the range of 1.5 to\n2 cycles.  Some static relays may operate in less than 1 cycle.\nMicroprocessor relays usually include internal self-checking functions for the majority of their functions.\nAs noted, the relay engineer also needs to be aware of the functions and features that may not be covered\nby an alarm, such as the capability of the output relays to function.\n12.3.2.5  In new installations, the use of microprocessor relays may result in reduced cost since fewer\nrelays are required.  Generally, less floor space is needed so smaller control buildings are needed for the\nequipment.  This may result in reduced auxiliary power system requirements.  The interconnection wiring\nin a panel is also reduced since many of the protective functions are included in one relay enclosure.\n12.3.2.6  For simple systems, control system design may be equally simple with electromechanical ,\nstatic, and microprocessor relays.  If the complexity of the power system requires many specific functions\nof protection, the microprocessor relays may provide a simpler installation.\n12.3.2.7  Consider the effects of the protective relay system on the personnel who will operate and\nmaintain the equipment.  If new devices are being proposed, special training may be required for them to\noperate and maintain the equipment.  Additional equipment may be necessary for relay testing, such as\ncomputers to connect locally to the microprocessor relays.\n12.3.2.8  Consider the lifetime of the installation the relays are being applied in.  Will spare parts be\navailable for the devices?  Will the manufacturer have personnel available to answer questions on the\nrelays in the future?\n12.3.2.9  Be aware that the complexity of the relay will increase the complexity of the relay settings.\nA simple electromechanical overcurrent relay has basically two settings: a tap setting for the pickup of the\nrelay and the time dial to determine the time delay until trip, if any.  A feeder with four overcurrent relays\nwill thus have eight settings, with a set of common phase settings and ground settings.  By comparison, a\nmicroprocessor relay may have up to 10 or more pages of relay settings.  A small part of these settings\nwill actually involve the protective functions of the relay; however, the relay engineer will need to study\nthe applicability of the functions and determine whether or not to use them.  In general, if the relay\nengineer does not need the function, the function should be disabled in the relay to avoid over-\ncomplicating the protection scheme.\n12.3.2.10  Do not ignore the personal preferences of the cooperative regarding the protective schemes\nand equipment used.  Design and application of protective relaying schemes is an art that uses science to\nmake it work.  In most cases, many relays and protective schemes can be used to protect a line or piece of\nequipment.  What is used depends largely on the skill of the relay engineer and preferences of the people\nwho will be operating and maintaining it.\n12.3.2.11  Substation automation combines many functions, such as relaying, metering, and data\nacquisition.  The relay engineer should be aware of the benefits and traps included in implementing relays\nin a substation automation project."

There are some cases where firms use programmable logic controllers to perform protective\nrelay functions.  These cases are usually either very simple, such as providing a timing function, or very\ncomplex, providing logic to control switching or testing of a three-terminal line.  In the majority of cases,\nthe relay engineer should use relays to provide the relay functions and not introduce automation\nequipment into the relay functions.  It is recommended the relays be used to do what they are designed to\ndo, provide system functions, and use automation equipment to provide additional operating features or\nmetering functions.\n12.3.2.12  To communicate relaying functions being used on a system, device function numbers and\ncontact designations have been developed to identify devices in protective relay schemes.  Appendices F\nand G to this chapter list the function numbers and contact designations summarized from IEEE\nStd. C37.2, “IEEE Standard Electrical Power System Device Function Numbers and Contact\nDesignations.”\n12.3.3  Overcurrent Relay\nThe overcurrent relay responds to a magnitude of current above a specified value.  There are four basic\ntypes of construction: plunger, rotating disc, static, and microprocessor.  In the plunger type, a plunger is\nmoved by magnetic attraction when the current exceeds a specified value.  In the rotating induction-disc\ntype, which is a motor, the disc rotates by electromagnetic induction when the current exceeds a specified\nvalue.  Static types convert the current to a proportional dc millivolt signal and apply it to a level detector\nwith voltage or contact output.  Such relays can be designed to have various current-versus-time operating\ncharacteristics.  In a special type of rotating induction-disc relay, called the voltage restrained overcurrent\nrelay, the magnitude of voltage restrains the operation of the disc until the magnitude of the voltage drops\nbelow a threshold value.  Static overcurrent relays are equipped with multiple curve characteristics and\ncan duplicate almost any shape of electromechanical relay curve.  Microprocessor relays convert the\ncurrent to a digital signal.  The digital signal can then be compared to the setting values input into the\nrelay.  With the microprocessor relay, various curves or multiple time-delay settings can be input to set\nthe relay operation.  Some relays allow the user to define the curve with points or calculations to\ndetermine the output characteristics.\nThe protective characteristic of the overcurrent relay, in terms of the impedance diagram, is a circle,\nassuming a constant voltage, with the relay located at the origin of the R-X coordinate diagram (see\nFigure 12-2).  The relay operates on the simple magnitude of current passing through it according to the\nsettings applied to the relay.\nThe overcurrent relay may be the simplest relay in concept to use.  When the current exceeds the setting\nvalue, it causes a trip.  Complications in applying the relay may occur when the system does not provide\nadequate differentiation between current values, such as between short lines on a system with high fault\ncurrent duties.  When a number of overcurrent relays are used sequentially in a circuit, the trip delay times\nmay become excessive.\n12.3.4  Distance Relay\nThe distance relay responds to a combination of both voltage and current.  The voltage restrains\noperation, and the fault current causes operation that has the overall effect of measuring impedance.  The\nrelay operates instantaneously (within a few cycles) on a 60-cycle basis for values of impedance below\nthe set value.  When time delay is required, the relay energizes a separate time-delay relay or function\nwith the contacts or output of this time-delay relay or function performing the desired output functions."

The relay operates on the\nmagnitude of impedance measured by the combination of restraint voltage and the operating current\npassing through it according to the settings applied to the relay.  When the impedance is such that the\nimpedance point is within the impedance characteristic circle, the relay will trip.  The relay is inherently\ndirectional.  The line impedance typically corresponds to the diameter of the circle with the reach of the\nrelay being the diameter of the circle.\nFigure 12-3:  Distance Protective Characteristic\nSince the relay responds directly to the value of impedance represented by the fault current and voltage\napplied to the relay, it will discriminate more correctly between the location of faults since the electric\npower system also may be represented by its impedance.  The distance relay may be used more\nsuccessfully on an electric power system when the magnitudes of fault current do not provide adequate\nlocation differentiation to be able to accurately trip specific breakers and isolate a fault."

Additional zones of protection will be used with timers to provide direct protection,\nor without timers and used in pilot protection schemes requiring communications from all remote\nterminals of the transmission line.  Distance elements may be used for out-of-step protection with the first\nzone impedance characteristic passing through the R-X impedance coordinate diagram origin and the\nremaining zones concentric around the first zone.\n12.3.5  Differential Relay\nThe differential relay is a current-operated relay that responds to the difference between two or more\ncurrents above a set value.  The relay works on the basis of the differential principle that what goes into\nthe device has to come out (see Figure 12-4).  If the current does not add to zero, the “error” (fault)\ncurrent flows to cause the relay to operate and trip the protected device.\nNote: For simplicity of illustration, the CTs are indicated with a 1:1 ratio\nand equal currents in the primary and secondary of the CTs.\nFigure 12-4:  Differential Relay Principle\nThe differential relay is used to provide internal fault protection to equipment such as transformers,\ngenerators, and buses.

A current differential relay provides restraint coils on the incoming\ncurrent circuits.  The restraint coils in combination with the operating coil provide an operation curve,\nabove which the relay will operate.  Some of the relays for specific equipment, such as transformers, use\nadditional restraint proportional to the harmonics sensed in the incoming currents.  Setting levels are\nbased on the characteristics of the protected equipment.\nDifferential relays are often used with a lockout relay to trip all power sources to the device and prevent\nthe device from being automatically or remotely re-energized.  The relays are very sensitive.  The\noperation of the device usually means major problems with the protected equipment and the likely failure\nin re-energizing the equipment.\n12.3.6  Overvoltage Relay\nThe overvoltage relay responds to a magnitude of voltage above a specified value.  As noted, the basic\ntypes of construction include plunger, rotating induction-disc, static, and microprocessor relays, all of\nwhich are discussed in Section 12.3.3.\n12.3.7  Undervoltage Relay\nThe undervoltage relay responds to a magnitude of voltage below a specified value and has the same\nbasic construction as the overvoltage relay.\n12.3.8  Power Relay\nA power relay responds to the product of the magnitude of voltage, current, and the cosine of the phase\nangle between the voltage and current, and is set to operate above a specified value.  The basic\nconstruction includes the rotating induction-disc, static, or microprocessor relay.  The relay is inherently\ndirectional since the normally open contacts close for power flow in one direction above a set value but\nremain open for power flow of any amount in the opposite direction.\n12.3.9  Directional Overcurrent Relay\nA directional overcurrent relay operates only for excessive current flow in a given direction.  Directional\novercurrent relays are available in electromechanical, static, and microprocessor constructions.  An\nelectromechanical overcurrent relay is made directional by adding a directional unit that prevents the\novercurrent relay from operating until the directional unit has operated.  The directional unit responds to\nthe product of the magnitude of current, voltage, and the phase angle between them, or to the product of\ntwo currents and the phase angle between them.  The value of this product necessary to provide operation\nof the directional unit is small, so that it will not limit the sensitivity of the relay (such as an overcurrent\nrelay that it controls).  In most cases, the directional element is mounted inside the same case as the relay\nit controls.  For example, an overcurrent relay and a directional element are mounted in the same case,\nand the combination is called a directional overcurrent relay.  Microprocessor relays often provide a\nchoice as to the polarizing method that can be used in providing the direction of fault, such as applying\nresidual current or voltage or negative sequence current or voltage polarizing functions to the relay.\n12.3.10  Frequency Relay\nA frequency relay responds to frequencies above or below a specified value.

There are two basic types:  direct\nand replica.\n12.3.11.1  Direct:   In the direct type of thermal relay, a device such as a thermocouple is embedded in\nthe equipment.  This device converts temperature to an electrical quantity such as voltage, current, or\nresistance.  The electrical quantity then causes a detecting element to operate.\n12.3.11.2  Replica:   In the replica type of thermal relay, a current proportional to the current supplied\nto the equipment flows through an element, such as a bimetallic strip, that has a thermal characteristic\nsimilar to the equipment.  When this element is heated by the flow of current, one of the metallic strips\nexpands more than the other, causing the bimetallic strip to bend and close a set of contacts.\n12.3.12  Pressure Relay\nThe pressure relay responds to sudden changes of either fluid or gas pressure.  It consists of a pressure-\nsensitive element and a bypass orifice located between the equipment to which the relay is connected and\na chamber that is part of the relay.  During slow pressure changes, the bypass orifice maintains the\npressure in the chamber to the same value as in the equipment.  During sudden pressure changes, the\norifice is not capable of maintaining the pressure in the chamber at the same value as in the equipment,\nand the pressure-sensitive element mechanically operates a set of contacts.\n12.3.13  Auxiliary Relay\nAuxiliary relays perform such functions as time delay, counting, and providing additional contacts upon\nreceiving a signal from the initiating relay.  These relays are necessary to provide the broad variety of\nschemes required by a power system.\n12.4 RELAY SCHEMES\n12.4.1  General\nProtective relays are most often applied with other protective and auxiliary relays as a system rather than\nindividually. The following basic scheme descriptions apply to electromechanical, static, and\nmicroprocessor relay systems.\nThe static and microprocessor relay systems generally have more elaborate logic involved in the tripping\ndecision, particularly in the area of transient blocking during external fault clearing.  Static systems\nrequire more careful treatment of input circuits, i.e., CT and PT leads are often shielded.  Static systems\nare slightly faster, require less maintenance, and are considerably more costly than the electromechanical\nsystems.\nMicroprocessor relays are very versatile and often can perform many functions at a lower cost than other\nmethods.  In addition to basic relaying they may do fault locating, fault data recording, self testing, and\nmetering.

The lines operate at the differing voltages included in\nthe power system.  The significance of a line to the electric power system varies according to the voltage\nlevel, the location of the line in the system, the loads carried by the line, and other factors specific to the\ncooperative.  Schemes for the relay protection of the line vary according to the significance of the line in\nthe system, the characteristics of faults on the line, the speed at which a line fault has to be cleared, and\nthe preferences of the relay engineer and the utility’s practices.  The protection schemes available for\ntransmission line relay protection include:\n1. Overcurrent, instantaneous, nondirectional\n2. Overcurrent, timed with either inverse curves or discrete times, nondirectional\n3. Overcurrent, instantaneous, directional\n4. Overcurrent, timed with either inverse curves or discrete times, directional\n5. Current differential using overcurrent\n6. Distance, instantaneous and timed\n7. Pilot with a communication channel between all terminals\nDepending on the fault characteristics of the line in question, the relay engineer may use any of the above\nrelay protection schemes for the protection of phase and ground faults on a transmission line.  Protection\nschemes may include the use of the schemes individually or in combinations to protect lines with primary\nand secondary protection schemes.\nThe relay engineer has to know the following in determining the relay protection to be used for a\ntransmission line:\n1. The configuration of the transmission line\n2. The number of line terminals\n3. Whether the line is radial or looped in the system\n4. How many taps, if any, are on the line\n5. How the line will be loaded\n6. Fault levels associated with the line\n7. Any other transmission line-specific data peculiar to the system\n8. Load-specific information such as specified outage times, temporary power levels, etc.\n9. System constraints such as out-of-step relay requirements\n10. Coordination requirements with relay systems of the remote line terminals\nHigher voltage transmission lines tend to have more sophisticated relay protection systems often using\npiloted schemes (the use of communications channels providing information from the remote end of the\nline) to provide more security.  Transmission lines at 345 kV normally utilize two primary relay schemes\nwith pilot protection.  However, the voltage of the line is not the primary factor in determining the types\nof relay protection that may be used.  Rather, it is the significance of the line in the power system and the\neffect of faults on the line that will determine the speed in which the line has to be removed from the\nsystem when a fault occurs.  Some lower voltage systems are in operation where extremely sophisticated"

The following are schemes used for transmission line protection.\n12.4.2.1  Non-Pilot Schemes:   Non-piloted schemes involve the use of relays to provide protection\nwithout the use of communications channels providing information from the remote end of the line.  The\nrelay measures the input quantities, makes the action decision based on those quantities, and provides an\noutput to the circuit breakers or circuit logic at the site of application based on the input and the relay\nlogic.  All the inputs and outputs are local to the site of application.\n12.4.2.1.1  Overcurrent Relaying:   Overcurrent relay protection is the simplest form of protection\nusually applied on lower voltage lines or on radially supplied feeders.  It is used occasionally as backup\nrelay protection for some transmission lines.  In its most basic form, nondirectional inverse time\novercurrent relays are applied on radial feeders with two phase devices and one ground device.  The fault\ncurrent is reduced by increased line impedance the further out on the line the fault occurs, resulting in a\nlonger time for the relay to trip the feeder.\nWhen a backfeed from another power source is possible on the feeder, directional overcurrent relays may\nbe used to provide selectivity between faults “in front” of or in the tripping direction of the relay versus\nthose behind the relay. An instantaneous overcurrent element is often used to protect the transmission line\nor feeder for high-current, close-in faults near the terminal where the relay is located.\nWhile this type of protection can be used on a network system with varying contributions from both\ndirections on the lines, it is extremely difficult to coordinate such a system and it should be avoided where\npossible.\n12.4.2.1.2  Current Differential with Overcurrent Relay:   This circuit uses the differential principle\nin connecting the CT circuits and an overcurrent relay instead of a differential relay.  The scheme has\nlimited use since the CTs from all terminals of the line, line segment, or bus has to be connected by the\nhardwire circuits back to the overcurrent relay.  This connection is more secure and can be set more\nsensitively than a simple overcurrent relay application.  It also can keep one more overcurrent relay from\nbeing in a string of overcurrent relays that have to be set with increasing time delay.\nThe circuit is typically used within a substation or generation plant facility where short line segments or\nbuses require protection that does not need the speed of a differential relay.  In applying the circuit, the\nrelay engineer has to be aware of the CT error and mismatch that may occur in the differential circuit to\nthe relay and set the relay over any mismatch that may occur.\nThe circuit is often applied in a variation as an open-differential circuit.  This circuit has a number of lines\nconnected to it with CTs connected in N-1 lines (see Figure 12-5).  The overcurrent relay is then set for\nthe load of the line without the CT.  This circuit is often applied as a backup circuit to a transformer\ndifferential circuit at a substation with an in-and-out transmission line.  The relay engineer has to be\naware of through faults in the lines with CTs that do not involve the line without the CT.  CT mismatch\nwill result in an error current as a result of the through-fault current that will flow to the relay.\n12.4.2.1.3  Step Distance Relaying:  Since the distance relay responds to the impedance of the\ndevice it is protecting, it can more easily be coordinated and used when the coordination of overcurrent\nrelays does not work.  The distance relay is more costly than the overcurrent relay and requires the"

Advantages of distance relays include a\nfixed reach based on the impedance of the protected device, regardless of the system voltage and current\nchanges; the ability to operate at fault currents less than load current; and little transient overreach.\nTwo relays are used to protect the total length of the line, providing protection referred to as zones (see\nFigure 12-6).  Zone 1 relay is typically set for 85 to 95 percent of the line impedance.  Zone 1 tripping\ntime is set for instantaneous tripping, that is, with no intentional time delay.  Zone 2 is typically set to\n120 to 150 percent of the line impedance.  Zone 2 needs to extend past the line being protected into the\nadjacent lines, not reaching past the far end terminal of the adjacent lines, yet ensuring the line in question\nis covered.  Zone 2 tripping time is typically set with 18 to 30 cycles of trip delay.\nFigure 12-6:  Distance Relay Zones 1 and 2\nThis scheme provides instantaneous tripping for 70 to 90 percent of the transmission line for a fault (F1,\nFigure 12-6) located within Zone 1 reach for both ends of the line.  For the remainder of the line, a fault\n(F2, Figure 12-6) near each line terminal is cleared in the time delay used for Zone 2.  A fault located near\na line terminal will be sequentially cleared by the near breaker tripping first and the remote terminal\nbreaker tripping after the Zone 2 trip time delay."

Zone 3 is usually set to reach\nthrough the next line to cover breaker failures.  The reach for the Zone 3 relay is usually in the range of\n200 to 225 percent of the line impedance.  Zone 3 tripping time is typically set with 60 to 120 cycles.  The\nimpedance setting will vary depending on the length of the adjacent lines.  Because of the reach of the\nZone 3 characteristic, it often encroaches on the load impedance and is susceptible to power system\nswings.  Use caution when incorporating Zone 3 relays since long settings can result in tripping on load.\nZone 3 may be reversed to look in the opposite direction of the line to which step distance relays are\nbeing applied.   This is the case when carrier schemes are applied.  Occasionally, a reverse-set Zone 3\nrelay is used as a local breaker failure relay, indicating failure of adjacent circuit breakers.\nStep distance relaying may be difficult to apply when the transmission lines are short, with little\nimpedance.  The settings for the distance relays may be very small, near the limits of the design for the\nrelay reach, resulting in the possibility of the relay’s overreaching and tripping for adjacent line faults.\nThree terminal lines will often use distance relays as fault detectors, but will normally require the\nimplementation of a pilot scheme to ensure tripping for all fault conditions.\n12.4.2.2  Pilot Schemes:   Pilot schemes simultaneously measure and monitor system parameters at all\nterminals of a transmission line, local and remote, and then respond according to their predetermined\nfunctions.  These schemes require the use of a communications channel that may be provided through\npilot wires, microwave, fiber, or power line carrier.  If the measured parameters exceed threshold values,\nappropriate actions are initiated.\nPilot schemes can generally be broken into two primary categories.  Those categories are directional\ncomparison and phase comparison.  Directional schemes use directional distance relays for phase fault\ndetection and either directional distance relays or directional overcurrent relays for ground fault detection.\nThe decision to trip is based on relay setting thresholds being exceeded and the faults being located in the\npredetermined direction for trip.\nPhase comparison schemes are an extension of the differential protection principal.  Currents from all line\nterminals are converted into a composite signal, transmitted to the remote terminals, and compared to the\nlocal terminal composite signal.  The result of the comparison will result in a trip if the relay setting\nthreshold is exceeded.  Phase comparison schemes are inherently directional and secure, not tripping for\nfaults outside the protected zone of protection.\n12.4.2.2.1  Directional Comparison :  Directional comparison schemes are divided into four\ncategories:\n1. Blocking Schemes\nDirectional comparison blocking uses distance relays as directional indicators and block\ninitiation for phase faults.  Either distance or directional overcurrent relays may be used for\nground fault indicators and block initiation.  Each terminal has trip and start relays.  The trip\nrelay reaches toward the remote terminal and a little beyond.  The start relay reaches\nbackwards, away from the protected section.  The trip relay attempts tripping when it operates\nunless it is stopped by receipt of a blocking signal (carrier, audio tone, or microwave) from the\nremote end.  The start relays at each end initiate the blocking signal.  Thus, if only the trip\nrelays see the fault, it is within the protected section and both ends trip.  If the fault is just\noutside one end, the start relays at that end operate and send a block signal to the remote end,\nwhich would otherwise trip.  The ground relays operate similarly."

A typical delay\ntime of 6 to 16 msec is used to coordinate for the channel delay in communications.  The\ncommunication channel is not required for tripping the breakers since the breakers will trip in\nthe absence of the blocking signal.  Failure of the channel could result in overtripping of the\nbreakers for adjacent line faults within the reach setting of the distance relays. Blocking\ndirectional comparison is commonly used with on/off type carrier facilities.  Since it is not\nnecessary to drive a signal through a fault to operate this scheme, it is the most popular carrier\nrelaying system.  See Figure 12-7.\nFigure 12-7:  Blocking Directional Comparison\n2. Unblocking Schemes\nDirectional comparison unblocking is similar to the blocking scheme except that the start\nrelays are deleted and the blocking, “guard” signal is sent continuously.  See Figure 12-8.  The\ncommunication signal for an unblocking scheme uses a frequency shift keying (FSK) channel.\nFor an internal fault, the frequency is shifted to the unblock, “trip” frequency.  The receivers\nreceive the trip frequency and close the output contact, which in series with the 21P relay\noutput contact will trip the breaker.  For an external fault, within the reach of one of the 21P\nrelays, the distant 21P relay will see the fault while the local 21P relay will not see the fault\nsince it is behind the relay.  The distant 21P relay will shift its transmitter frequency to trip.\nThe local 21P relay will not send the trip frequency or close the 21P output contacts.  The line"

Should the receivers fail to receive a guard signal and a trip signal, the\nreceivers will allow typically 150 msec of receiver contact closure to permit the 21P relay\ncontact to trip the line.  After this time limit, the communication channel will lock out.\nFigure 12-8:  Directional Comparison Unblocking\nThis scheme is more secure since overtripping is avoided at all times with the exception of the\n150-msec interval during the loss of signal.  Reliability is improved since the communication\nchannel operates continuously and can be monitored, providing an alarm in the case of failure.\nThe scheme is applicable for two-terminal and multi-terminal lines.  Separate channels are\nrequired between each pair of line terminals.\n3. Overreaching Transfer Trip Schemes\nPermissive overreach is also a simple scheme, requiring only one overreaching fault detector\nat each terminal.  This fault detector sends both a trip signal and attempts local tripping\nthrough a contact on the receiver.  If both relays see a fault, both ends trip simultaneously.\nThe scheme appears similar to the directional comparison unblocking scheme of Figure 12-8.\nA trip signal is required for this scheme to trip.  Power line carrier channels therefore are not\nrecommended for these schemes since a fault could short out the carrier signal.  These\nchannels are normally used with audio tones with frequency shift keying over microwave,\nleased line, or fiber-optic communications.\nThe overreaching transfer trip scheme provides highly secure transmission line protection\nsince a trip signal is required from both ends of the line for tripping to occur.  The\ndependability of the scheme may be less than the blocking schemes since the trip signal has to\nbe received before the tripping is initiated.  The scheme is often used when an existing non-\npiloted scheme has communications added for piloting."

Underreaching Transfer Trip Schemes\nUnderreaching transfer trip schemes include two variations: direct underreach and permissive\nunderreach.\nThe communications for this type of relaying are generally the same as for the overreaching\nsystems, using audio tones with frequency shift keying over microwave, leased line, or fiber-\noptic communications channels.\na. Direct Underreach\nThis form of protection requires only a single distance fault detector at each end.  It has to\nbe set short of the remote end and will simultaneously trip the local breaker and send a\ntrip signal to the remote end, which then trips directly upon receipt of the signal.  Note\nthat local confirmation is not required upon receipt of a trip signal.  Though this scheme\nis the least complex, it is seldom used because of the high risk of false outputs from the\ncommunication channel, which would result in false trips.  This risk can be minimized by\nusing a dual-channel transfer trip, which requires the receipt of two signals from the\nremote end to effect a trip.  See Figure 12-9.\nFigure 12-9:  Direct Underreach"

    "content": "Bulletin 1724E-300\nPage 621\nb. Permissive Underreach\nThis scheme is identical to the direct underreach scheme with the addition of an\noverreaching fault detector.  The transfer trip signal requires local confirmation by this\nfault detector before tripping can occur.  This increases the security of the scheme and the\nconsequent range of application.  It is commonly selected when an existing step distance\nrelay line is to have the pilot added.  See Figure 12-10.  Carrier is not normally used since\na fault could short out the communication signal and prevent the signal from reaching the\nremote terminal.\nFigure 12-10:  Permissive Underreach\n12.4.2.2.2  Phase Comparison :  Phase comparison relay systems monitor the current direction at each\nline terminal of the protected line and transmit this information to the other terminal via a communication\nchannel.  Each line terminal compares local and remote current direction and trips if the current is into the\nline from both terminals.  The communication channel is normally an on/off type of communications,\ntransmitting only when the overcurrent detector’s thresholds have been exceeded.  This system is immune\nto tripping on overloads or system swings since it operates on current direction only.  It needs no potential\nsource unless it has to be supervised by distance relays because of low fault currents.\nCurrent or distance fault detectors are used to supervise tripping.  These detectors have to be set above\nline charging current, which can appear to the relays as an internal fault at low loads.  Internal timers have\nto be set to compensate for the transit time of the communication channel.  One of the most popular\napplications of this system is on lines with series capacitors because it is less likely that such a current-\noperated scheme will operate incorrectly for faults near the capacitors."

The difference between this scheme and others is that a pair of telephone wires is\nused as the communication channel.  A special filter in the relay converts the three-phase\ncurrents to a single-phase voltage and applies this voltage to the wires.  When current flows\nthrough the protected section, the voltages at each end oppose each other and no current flows\nin the operate coils.  When current enters the line from each end, the voltage on the pilot wire\nreverses to allow current to circulate through the operate coils and consequently trip both ends.\nSpecial monitor relays sound an alarm if the pilot wire pair becomes open or shorted.  The\nwire line has to have adequate protection against induced voltages and a rise in station ground\npotential but may not use carbon block protectors because the line has to remain in service\nwhile the protection is operating.  Neutralizing transformers and gas tubes with mutual\ndrainage reactors, all with adequate voltage ratings, comprise the preferred pilot wire\nprotection package.\nThis relaying has the advantage of simplicity and does not require a potential source.  It does\nnot provide backup protection.  Its application is limited to short lines a mile or so in length\nbecause of pilot wire cost and increased exposure.  The system’s dependability is based on the\nintegrity of the pilot wires themselves.  Many pilot wire systems have been replaced with other\npilot schemes because of the failure of the pilot wire system to function reliably and securely.\nRecently, pilot wire systems have been replaced with fiber-optic systems providing the\ncommunications systems, using a module to convert the output voltage to a light signal.  These\nmodified systems have provided a more dependable and secure protection system.\n2. Single-Phase Comparison\nThis scheme applies a sequencing network to the current inputs to the relay to produce a\nsingle-phase voltage output.  This output is proportional to the positive, negative, and zero\nphase sequence components of the input currents.  This signal is squared so that the positive\nportion of the signal provides the positive portion of the square wave.  The negative portion of\nthe signal provides the zero portion of the square wave.  Two fault detectors are normally used\nto provide security, with the more sensitive detector used as the carrier start to transmit the\nsignal to the remote end.  The less sensitive detector is used to arm the comparison module for\na trip upon the correct comparison of the local and remote signals.  See Figure 12-11.\nNormally current-operated units are used as the fault detectors.  In a case where the fault\ncurrent is less than the load current, impedance-operated units may be used for fault detection.\nThe use of impedance fault detectors will increase the cost of the system because of the\nnecessity of having line potentials for the operation of the relay.\n3. Dual-Phase Comparison\nThis scheme is similar to the single-phase comparison scheme except that square wave signals\nare developed for the positive and the negative portions of the single-phase voltage output of\nthe sequencing network.  Each signal requires a separate channel for the transmission of\ninformation to the remote site.  This scheme can provide a slightly higher speed of detection\nsince faults are detected on both the positive and the negative portions of the single-phase\nvoltage output of the sequencing network.  This scheme is normally used with a frequency-\nshift channel, which is continuously transmitted.  On a power line carrier it is configured as an\nunblocking scheme."

The operation of the scheme is basically as described above in the\nprevious phase comparison schemes.\n12.4.3  Distribution Feeder\nDistribution line switching and protection within the substation are provided by circuit breakers,\nreclosers, or fuses.  The selection of the protective devices to be used on any particular feeder will depend\non the load being fed by the feeder, the magnitude of loads being served, any special protective\nrequirements necessitated by the load, and the cooperative’s preferences in design and operating\npractices.  In addition to the above-listed items, sectionalizers may be located on the distribution feeders\nfor additional segmenting of the line during fault conditions.\n12.4.3.1  Circuit Breakers:   Circuit breakers will most commonly use overcurrent relays to provide\nfault protection at a substation.  Historically, on a typical radial distribution feeder, two phase and one\nground (if the system is grounded) nondirectional inverse time overcurrent relays with instantaneous\nelements will be the minimum relays that are applied that will detect all phase and ground faults when\nproperly coordinated.  Often, a third overcurrent relay is applied to the phases.  This will provide\ncomplete protection for faults if one of the relays should be disabled.  This also permits the removal of\none of the relays for testing outside the case, providing protection for the feeder without taking the feeder\nout of service.  With today’s microprocessor relays, three-phase relays and the neutral relay are applied to\ndetect all faults when properly coordinated.  The time–current characteristic chosen for coordination of\nprotective devices will depend on what downstream devices are present on the feeder.  See Figure 12-12.\nFigure 12-12:  Distribution Circuit Protective Elements"

Special circumstances on a feeder will allow specific relays to be\napplied to address those circumstances.  Microprocessor relays will often have a number of protective\nfunctions available that may be used for special circumstances.   Relay protection for circuit breakers may\nbe more readily customized and applied to special situations.  Many of the microprocessor relays\navailable for distribution feeder protection also include multiple setting groups.  This feature will allow a\nrelay to be set for a particular configuration. Should the configuration change, the setting group can be\nchanged, either automatically or manually, to provide for different settings to adjust the relay protection\nto the new configuration.\n12.4.3.2  Automatic Circuit Reclosers:   Reclosers are devices similar to circuit breakers but more\ncompact and self-contained so that they may be used within the substation or mounted on poles out on the\ndistribution feeder. The controls permit various combinations of instantaneous and time-delayed trips and\nautomatic reclosures so that coordination may be accomplished with both upstream and downstream\ndevices.  Reclosers may be single- or three-phase interrupters.  Single-phase reclosers are series trip\ndevices, and three-phase reclosers may be either series trip or nonseries trip devices.  Nonseries trip\nreclosers usually employ a solid-state control and have a self-contained battery.  Some single-phase\nreclosers are available with electronic controls.\nSingle-phase reclosers usually provide better service reliability to rural distribution circuits because a\nfault to ground on one phase will not trip the other phases.  However, where loads are predominantly\nthree phase, or where the load on the circuit is large, three-phase reclosers with ground trip settings are\ndesirable to achieve the required sensitivity for ground faults.\nMicroprocessor controls are also available for reclosers.  The microprocessor adds much flexibility to the\ncontroller and provides additional functions, similar to many of the microprocessor relays.  Also, many\nadditional protective characteristics (curves) are typically available in the microprocessor controls.  There\nis normally a communications port available on the control that can then provide data to remote sites.\n12.4.3.2.1  Sectionalizers :  These devices, located outside the substation on the distribution lines, are\nsimilar to reclosers, except that they do not interrupt fault current.  Instead, the sectionalizer counts trips\nof an upstream recloser and opens its contacts during a de-energized period following a predetermined\nnumber of recloser interruptions. Sectionalizers can, however, interrupt load currents within their rating.\nSee Figure 12-12.\n12.4.3.2.2  Fuses :  Fuses are used both to protect connected distribution transformers and to protect\nsections or branches of the distribution circuit.  Occasionally, they are used within the substation for\nprotection of a feeder or as backup protection for a bypass switch around a recloser or a breaker.  They\nare most commonly supplied in outdoor holders that are combination fuseholders and disconnect\nswitches.  Fuses are usually applied as the farthest downstream device in a sectionalizing scheme because\nof their nonrepeating nature.  An upstream recloser trips and recloses several times with the accumulated\n“on” time being sufficient to blow the fuse during a delayed trip.  The recloser then resets before the trip\noccurs.\n12.4.3.2.3  Coordination :  Coordinating these devices on a distribution circuit involves the progressive\ndisconnecting of sections of the distribution circuit beginning at the end farthest from the station until the\nfault is removed.  Since several different types of devices are involved, this process can be more complex\nthan coordinating a transmission line."

This\nmeans that the relay, recloser, and sectionalizer has to be programmed so that they will let enough\naccumulated fault current through (integrated over several reclosures) that none of these devices locks\nout.  Generally, the recloser will have one fast and three delayed trips in such a situation.  Time curves\nwill be selected so that the fuse will blow during the second delayed trip.  The sectionalizer would be\nprogrammed to open following the second delayed trip to clear a fault at F2.  A fault at F3 would then be\ncleared when the recloser locks out following the third (delayed) trip.  The relay would be set to clear a\nfault at F4 but coordinated with the line recloser so as not to trip for a fault at F3, paying careful attention\nto overtravel and reset time of electromechanical reclosers following each successive interruption.\nThis is a simplified example of distribution coordination and ignores complications, such as long\nbranches and improperly applied protective devices, both common occurrences on real distribution\nsystems.  In such cases, compromises have to be made and areas of nonselectivity accepted.  The\ncoordination process involves moving these areas of nonselectivity into positions where they do the least\nharm.\n12.4.4  Major Equipment\n12.4.4.1  Transformer and Reactor Protection:   Transformers are protected by fuses or circuit-\ninterrupting devices such as breakers or circuit switchers with relays detecting faults and providing trip\nsignals to the circuit-interrupting devices.  Transformers 5 MVA and below are almost always protected\nby fuses.  Relay protection of transformers is most often used for transformers rated 10 MVA and above\nalthough there are transformers up to 30 MVA that are protected by fuses.\nFuse protection has the merits of being economical and requiring little maintenance.  Fuses require no\ncircuit-interrupting devices such as circuit breakers or circuit switchers and no battery power systems for\nauxiliary power.  Auxiliary equipment that would normally be located within a control building is\nminimized, resulting in the reduced need for and cost of a control building.  Fuses will provide protection\nfor primary and secondary external faults, but little protection for transformer internal faults.  Fuses\nintroduce the probability of creating a severely unbalanced (single-phasing) voltage condition for\nsecondary loads should only one fuse blow.  Proper coordination with secondary devices is essential to\navoid this condition.\nRelay protection for the larger size transformers usually includes sudden pressure relays, differential\nrelays, overcurrent relays or directional phase distance relays, and ground overcurrent relays. See Fig-\nure 12-13.  Sudden pressure relays are often considered by many to be the primary relay protection on a\ntransformer.  The sudden pressure relay is sensitive to the sudden changes in pressure in the transformer\ntank that occur during an internal fault.  Differential protection is a primary scheme of protection that is\nnormally applied on a percentage differential basis to allow for differences in transformer ratios,\nmagnetizing current, and current transformer mismatch.  Overcurrent relays are often applied on the\nprimary voltage winding to provide backup protection to the differential relay protection.  If the\novercurrent relays may not be coordinated with the secondary main and feeder relays, a directional phase\ndistance relay may be applied.  A ground overcurrent relay is normally applied to provide increased\nsensitivity to ground faults.\nFigure 12-13 indicates the possibility of using local primary and secondary breakers.  Because of\neconomics, a primary breaker is sometimes not used.  Tripping of the transformer is accomplished by\nsending a transfer trip signal to the remote substation using a communications signal or a high-speed\nground switch.  The time required to isolate the transformer is increased by the communication channel\ntime or the time for the remote relay and breaker to clear the fault established by the high-speed ground"

The engineer will have to decide whether or not to trip all\nthe feeder breakers or to manually open the feeder breakers before re-energizing the transformer.\nReactors may be protected by generator-type differential relays with phase and ground overcurrent\nbackup relays.  Occasionally, phase distance relays are used for backup.\nAdditional means of protection applied to transformers and reactors include negative sequence relays,\novervoltage relays, and thermal relays.  Negative sequence relays can be set sensitively to back up\ndifferential relays since they do not respond to load current.  Overvoltage relays will protect the\ntransformer from excessive system voltage that will result in excessive transformer magnetizing current\nand heating of the transformer core.  Thermal relays provide additional protection for the transformer\nagainst internal heating as a result of overloading the transformer.\nEach transformer installation should be individually evaluated for the type of protection that is to be\napplied.\n12.4.4.2  Bus Protection\n1. Remote Tripping for Bus Fault\nShort-circuit faults on buses can be isolated by allowing remote substation breakers on all\nlines that feed into the faulted bus to trip by Zone 2 or time-delay ground relay.  This type of\nbus protection is simple and the most economical.  It has the disadvantage that any loads fed\nby lines to the remote substations are also removed from service.  Another disadvantage is that\nthe time necessary to clear the fault may be intolerable.\n2. Local Tripping for Bus Fault\na. In distribution substations, the bus protection is often provided by overcurrent relays,\nphase and neutral, located on either the low-voltage or high-voltage side of the\ntransformer.  See Figure 12-13.  The phase relays have to be set to coordinate with the\nfeeder relays and any additional downstream devices.  This results in a slow trip time for\nthe clearing of the bus.  Each bus has to be evaluated to determine if the time delay that\nwill be experienced by this type of protection will be excessive and if this type of\nprotection will be adequate.  This bus protection scheme is very simple and may also be\nable to act, in part, as backup protection to the feeder relays.\nb. Short-circuit faults can be removed by a bus protective scheme in which all the substation\nbreakers associated with a faulted bus are tripped.  The two basic types of bus protective\nschemes are current differential and voltage differential.  The current differential scheme\nconnects all the current transformers on all the circuits connected to a bus in parallel, and\nthe relays operate on the unbalanced current that exists during fault conditions.  See\nFigure 12-14.  During normal conditions, there should be no unbalanced current, since\nthe current entering a bus has to equal the current leaving a bus.  Restraint coils help to\ncompensate for unequal current transformer performance during external faults, but the\nscheme still has to be applied carefully on buses with high short-circuit capabilities.\nVoltage differential schemes use the same parallel connection but connect a high-\nimpedance voltage element across the parallel.  It is possible to set this voltage element\nwell above the worst case external fault voltage and still retain adequate sensitivity for\ninternal faults.  This type of relay performs well on buses with high short-circuit\ncapability."

This provides an\ninexpensive relay for use in the operation of the differential circuit.  The disadvantage of\nthe overcurrent relay is that there is no restraint in each of the relay circuits.  Any\nmismatch in the CTs has to be taken into consideration in the settings of the relay by\nusing a higher pickup amperage or a longer time delay.  This will make the operation of\nthe circuit slower than the times provided by differential relays.  Many times this time\ndelay is unacceptable for the coordination with the rest of the system relays.\nc. Since the recent use of the microprocessor relay that normally provides additional\nfunctions at a relatively inexpensive cost, a pseudo bus differential scheme has been\napplied.  This scheme uses a combination of instantaneous relay elements from the\nsecondary main bus relay and the feeder relays to detect whether the fault is on the feeder\nor on the bus.  See Figure 12-15.  This scheme requires that there be no fault sources on\nthe feeders since the operation of the feeder instantaneous elements for reverse feeder\ncurrent would make the fault look like a feeder fault and cause the scheme to fail.  If fault\nsources are located on the feeders, directional instantaneous overcurrent relays have to be\nused.  An instantaneous element is used on the main breaker relay with a setting that is\nensured to pick up any bus fault.  The instantaneous elements of the feeder relays have to\nbe set to reach out farther than the main breaker relay so that, for any close-in feeder fault\nthat the main breaker relay will see, the feeder relay will also see and disable the circuit.\nFor a bus fault, the feeders will not see the fault so the relay takes no action.  The main\nbreaker relay sees the fault, closes its contact, and, after the appropriate time delay, trips\nthe breaker.  This circuit will be slower than an actual differential relay circuit operating\ntime, but will be faster than the overcurrent relay in protecting the bus from damage."

Local tripping for a bus fault may be accomplished by the use of a reverse-looking\nZone  3 element from a distance relay.  Zones 1 and 2 on a line are set to look out on the\nline, away from the bus.  Often, the Zone 3 element is set to look in the reverse direction,\nwhich will see the bus behind it.  Through a timer, the Zone 3 may be set to trip through-\nbus faults.\n12.4.4.3  Breaker Failure Protection:   Breaker failures can normally be separated into two classes:\nthe failure of the breaker itself and the failure of the relaying associated with the breaker.  Schemes\ndeveloped to protect for the failure of breakers are based on providing either remote backup or local\nbackup.  Failure of the breaker results in the necessity to trip all the adjacent breakers in order to clear the\nfault and to isolate the failed breaker.\n1. Remote Backup\nRemote backup normally consists of a Zone 3 distance relay and/or ground time overcurrent\nrelay set to cover lines contiguous to the line being protected.  This scheme will provide\nprotection for breaker failure regardless of whether the failure is a result of relay failure or\nbreaker failure.  It will normally see faults on the protected line plus faults on the next bus and\nline adjacent to the protected line.  This scheme has the advantage of simplicity.\nComplications in using the scheme include that the relay has to be set above the maximum\nload current that is carried on the lines, yet it has to be set sensitively enough to see the faults\nthat may occur on the lines.  Faults occurring at the remote ends of the lines may not be\ndetected because of insufficient current flow.  When applied on a system where the adjacent"

When adjacent lines are multi-\nterminal lines, a number of terminals may be unnecessarily tripped by remote backup.  Longer\nreach Zone 3 relays are more susceptible to out-of-step system swings.  Even with its\nshortcomings, in some situations with its inherent economics, this scheme may provide\nacceptable backup performance.\n2. Local Backup\na. A simple means of providing local backup protection is to use the Zone 3 relay looking in\nthe reverse direction.  This provides a degree of protection for local equipment including\nall adjacent breakers, bus, lines, and remote terminals.  Advantages and disadvantages in\nthe use of this scheme are included in the discussion above on remote backup.\nb. An additional means of providing breaker protection is to add timing to the primary\nrelays.  If the relays do not trip and the fault is still on the system within the set time of\nthe timer, the timer will act to trip all adjacent breakers.  This scheme depends on the\nproper action of the primary relays and provides no backup to the failure of those relays.\nc. An additional scheme provides the use of a second set of relays to back up the primary\nrelaying.  Carried to the maximum limit, a second dc tripping system is provided\nincluding battery, panels, charger, relays, breaker trip coils, CTs, and potential devices.\nThis degree of duplication is occasionally provided for EHV systems.  Higher voltage\nsystems including 69 kV and above will often provide dual trip coils in the circuit\nbreakers, and primary and secondary relays with dual dc trip buses.  The engineer has to\ndecide if auxiliary dc power systems will be duplicated, including power panels and\nchargers; often both systems are fed from a common battery.  The reduced cost of\nrelaying afforded by the development of microprocessor relays makes this option a\nrelatively economical option to provide backup protection for relays.  This scheme does\nnot provide for the tripping of adjacent breakers in the case of the failure of the breaker\nmechanical mechanism to trip the breaker and clear the fault.\nd. Full breaker failure backup includes protection for the failure of relays and the failure of\nthe breaker.  A separate backup relay that acts to trip all adjacent breakers, including\nremote breakers by means of a transfer trip, provides this degree of backup.  Figure 12-16\nindicates a typical configuration for a local breaker failure relay.  Indicated are primary\nand secondary relays, dual trip coils in the breaker, and the fault detector and timer\nassociated with the breaker relay.  Should either the primary or secondary relay call for a\ntrip of the breaker, an auxiliary relay, 62X or 62Y, keys the timer.  If the fault is not\nremoved during the setting for the timer, the 86BF lockout relay is picked up to trip all\nadjacent breakers and transfer trip any remote breakers.  The time setting for the timer is\nusually in the range of 10 to 20 cycles.  If either the protective scheme resets or the\ncurrent relay drops out within the set time, nothing happens.\n12.4.5  Reclosing\n12.4.5.1  General:   Protective relays detect faults or abnormal conditions.  These faults or abnormal\nconditions can be transient or permanent.  For open-wire overhead circuits, such as most of the\ndistribution lines, most faults are transient faults, caused for example by lightning, that can be cleared by\ndisconnecting the circuit from the power source.

The\ndisconnecting device can be reclosed either manually or automatically.  Manual reclosing is performed by\nfollowing the same procedures used in closing the device.  Automatic reclosing is usually performed by\nautomatic reclosing relays.  Reclosing is generally not applied where permanent faults are more likely,\nsuch as on cables."

Relays that permit one reclosing operation are called single-shot reclosing relays, while relays that\npermit more than one reclosing operation are called multishot reclosing relays.  Single-shot reclosing\nrelays can be either the manual- or self-reset type.  The manual-reset types have to be manually reset after\neach automatic reclosing operation to obtain succeeding automatic reclosing operations.  The self-reset\ntypes automatically reset if the breaker remains closed for a predetermined time.  Multishot reclosing\nrelays are of the self-reset type.  Automatic reclosing can take place either instantaneously or with time\ndelay, when the line is de-energized or energized, or when the voltages on both sides of the breaker are\nsynchronized.  On radial circuits, the first reclosure is usually instantaneous, with additional reclosures,\nwhen used, taking place after some time delay.  On loop or multiterminal distribution lines, instantaneous\nreclosing is generally not used unless special forms of protective relaying are applied to ensure\nsimultaneous operation of all line breakers for all line faults.  After a specified number of unsuccessful\nautomatic reclosure attempts, the breaker is usually locked open.\n12.4.6  Coordination\nWhen a circuit element such as a line, transformer, or bus becomes faulted, it has to be removed from\nservice.  This, as has been previously stated, is the function of the protective relay system.  Coordination\nis the process of ensuring that only those elements of the power system that has to be removed to clear the\nfault, and no more, are tripped in the shortest time possible.\nAs previously discussed, some schemes are inherently selective in tripping the protected equipment.  Such\nprotection schemes include differential schemes and transmission line phase protection that are\ndifferential in nature.  No additional coordination is required for these schemes.\nCoordination with distance relays is the easiest to accomplish.  Since such a relay’s reach is constant\nunder all system conditions, the instantaneous zone is typically set short of the remote end of the line by\n10 percent, and it will never trip for any condition but a fault on the protected section.  With the remote\nend set the same, 80 percent of the line is thus covered by instantaneous protection.  To cover the\nremaining 20 percent, the second zone can be relied on or a piloted scheme can be added.  The second\nzone reaches beyond the protected section and so it has to have a time delay to allow the breaker at the\nremote station to clear a fault on another line.  The third zone reaches beyond the remote second zones\nand so has to time coordinate in the same manner, thus the increasing time settings.\nCoordinating with overcurrent relays can be more difficult and can also require a more detailed\nknowledge of system parameters.\nFor the simple system shown in Figure 12-17, with a fault at X, the near relays at C and D has to operate\nand their breakers have to be completely open before the remote or backup relays at A and F close their\ncontacts.  It is assumed that:\n1. A faulted condition exists until the breakers isolating the fault are entirely open.\n2. When a relay closes its tripping contacts, a “seal-in” auxiliary relay ensures that the switching\noperation will be completed even though the fault is cleared at the same instant the relay\ncontacts close."

    "content": "Bulletin 1724E-300\nPage 634\nFigure 12-17:  Coordination Conditions\nThe time delay of the remote relay necessary for selectivity has to be equal to the operating time of the\nnear relay plus the opening time of the breaker; plus a reasonable factor of safety, which can be taken at\nabout 25 percent of the combined relay and breaker time with a minimum allowance of not less than six\ncycles if the relays are normally field calibrated at the calculated setting.  If the relays are bench tested at\ntypical setting values and only adjusted in the field with no further calibration, this margin has to be\ngreater, typically 0.2 to 0.3 seconds.\nAdditional requirements for adequate relay coordination include the following:\n1. The relays have to be capable of carrying a reasonable emergency overload without tripping\nincorrectly on load current.\n2. The relays have to be able to operate under minimum system generating conditions for faults\nat the far ends of the sections that they protect.\nMaximum system generating conditions include a sufficient number of generators in service to supply the\nmaximum demand load of the system.  Similarly, the minimum system generating conditions include only\nthe generators in service necessary to supply the minimum system load.  Such minimum conditions would\nprobably exist early Sunday mornings, for example.  In addition to the above generation, there are usually\nsome emergency generators in service called “spinning reserve” that can immediately pick up load if a\ngenerator fails.  Both maximum and minimum conditions have to be checked, since maximum generation\nusually results in faster operation of induction-type relays with more critical selectivity, and the minimum\ncondition determines whether the relays will receive sufficient current to operate.\nThe output of a synchronous generator under fault conditions is variable, depending on the characteristics\nof the machine and the duration of the fault.  The initial output, which is maintained for three cycles or\nless, may be four to ten times the normal machine rating and is determined by the subtransient reactance .\nThe generator output rapidly decreases to the value determined by transient reactance , the average value\nof which may be assumed to exist for about 30 cycles on turbine generators and up to 120 cycles on\ncondensers and slow-speed generators.  The transient reactance may be taken roughly as 125 percent to\n150 percent of the subtransient reactance.  If the fault is not cleared, the generator output approaches the\nsynchronous value, which is equal to or slightly less than the normal rating.  It is the common practice,\ntherefore, to use generator subtransient reactance values when calculating maximum fault kVA and to use\ntransient values for minimum generating conditions.  Synchronous values of short-circuit kVA are not\nusually calculated, but the decrease in generator output should be considered for slow operating relays."

On transmission systems where the relative\ndistribution of ground fault current is changed for minimum generation because grounded transformers\nhave been removed from service, it may be necessary to calculate and check the relay settings for both\nmaximum and minimum ground faults.  It may also be necessary to show minimum ground faults for\nsome special conditions with certain lines or transformer banks out of service.\nBriefly summarized, the job of the relay engineer is to assume various types of faults at numerous points\non a system.  The magnitude and distribution of fault currents are then calculated for these fault points\nwith maximum and minimum generating conditions. Faults are assumed for normal system operating\nconditions and for various special conditions with certain lines, generators, or transformers out of service.\nThe operating time of all breakers involved have to be checked and tabulated and, for high burdens or low\nratios, the true or effective ratios of bushing-type current transformers have to be determined.  Having\nobtained these data, the next step is to determine suitable settings or adjustments for the relays that will\nprovide selective operation for each fault condition.  The tentative relay settings, the calculated current\nvalues, and the operating times of the near and remote relays for each fault condition are worked up and\nrecorded as “Details of Selectivity” or on “Selectivity Curves.”  After the most satisfactory settings are\ndetermined, “Summary Sheets” are made up for all the relays at each station.  The Summary Sheets have\nthe instructions or calibration data to enable the relay personnel in the field to set or adjust the relays to\nobtain the desired operating characteristics.\n12.5 REFERENCES\nBlackburn, J.

Depending on equipment types and\nconfigurations, a large variety of instruments, transducers, and meters may be used to perform this\nfunction.\n13.2 INSTRUMENTS AND TRANSDUCERS\n13.2.1  Definitions\nAn instrument is a device for sensing the magnitude of a physical quantity.  It is calibrated or\nprogrammed to indicate or record this magnitude based on a known standard.  The instrument may be\nindicating or recording.  A transducer is a device that converts a physical quantity to a proportional low-\nlevel dc signal.  Electrical transducers typically change amperes, watts, volts, and VARs to millivolt or\nmilliampere signals.  Transducer outputs can be used to operate local instruments or can be employed in\ndata acquisition systems.\n13.2.1.1  Indicating Instruments:  An indicating instrument depicts the present value of the quantity\nmeasured by the position of a pointer relative to a scale or as a digital display.  It is used to give an\nobserver information regarding the present operation of equipment or circuits.\n13.2.1.2  Recording (Graphic) Instruments:  A recording or graphic instrument makes graphic\nrecords of the value of a quantity as a function of time.  This type of instrument is used when a permanent\nrecord of how the measured quantity varies with time is needed.\n13.2.2  Types of Instruments and Transducers\nInstruments (indicating and recording) and transducers may be grouped according to the quantity they\nmeasure.  The specific quantity is generally used with the suffix “meter” to identify the instrument.  Thus,\nan ammeter is an instru ment that measures amperes , a voltmeter is an instrument that measures voltages,\netc.  The most commonly used instruments for measurements of electrical quantities are ammeter,\nvoltmeter, wattmeter, varmeter, frequency meter, and ohmmeter.\n13.2.3  Classification of Instruments\n13.2.3.1  Switchboard or Panel Instruments:   Switchboard instruments are intended for fixed\ninstallation on switchboards, panels, or consoles.  Since they are constructed for fixed installations, they\nrequire careful handling in transport.  Panel instruments are similar to switchboard instruments, but are\nused where smaller scale instruments are satisfactory.\n13.2.4  Components of Instruments and Transducers\n13.2.4.1  Analog Indicating Instruments:  The components of analog indicating instruments are\nmechanism, scale, base, and cover.  The mechanism is an arrangement of parts for producing and control-\nling the motion of the indicating hand or pointer.  The mechanism for electromagnetic instruments"

The\ncomponents of thermal instruments are the same as those for electromagnetic instruments except the\nmechanism consists of the moving element, bimetallic strip, heater, adjusting spring, and instrument hand\nor pointer.\n13.2.4.2  Digital Indicating Instruments:   These instruments are completely solid state and either\ncontain a transducer or require inputs in the form of dc millivolt signals from transducers.  The\ninstruments then condition the signals to eliminate noise bursts and surges, feed the conditioned signals to\nanalog to digital converters followed by binary-to-decimal encoders, and display the quantities on gaseous\ndischarge or light-emitting diode displays.  Internal “clocks” (usually 1 kHz oscillators) update the\ndisplays every millisecond.  In addition to the digital display, these instruments may also have\ncommunications circuitry to permit remote monitoring of the measured quantities.\n13.2.4.3  Recording Instruments:   These instruments are similar to digital indicating instruments but\nhave the additional capability of data storage.  Recording instruments employ electronic memory to store\nmeasured values recorded over a specified period.  The stored data may be retrieved at a later date for\nfurther review and study.  Various forms of communication including telephone circuit, microwave radio,\nand fiber-optic network may be used to retrieve data stored by the recording instrument.  In some cases,\nthe recording instrument may be connected to a local printer.  The local printer is used to produce a paper\ncopy of the stored data in table or graphical form.\n13.2.5  Analog Instrument Scales\nThe instrument scale depicts the numerical value of the quantity being measured as indicated by the\nposition of the hand or pointer with respect to scale markings. Convenient scales will give more accurate\ninformation and lessen observer eye strain.  There are two basic types of instrument scales:  linear scale\nand nonlinear scale.\n13.2.5.1  Linear Scale:   This scale is divided into a number of equally spaced segments, each segment\nrepresenting the same unit of measurement.  This type of scale is used when there are wide variations in\nthe magnitude of the measured quantity.  Figure 13-1 shows two analog switchboard voltmeters with\nlinear scales.\nFigure 13-1:  Linear Scale Analog Switchboard Voltmeters.  Courtesy of Yokogawa."

    "content": "Bulletin 1724E-300\nPage 653\n13.2.5.2  Nonlinear Scale:   This scale is divided into a number of unequally spaced segments.  Each\nsegment may or may not represent the same unit of measurement.  Usually the segments are expanded at\none end of the scale and compressed at the other end of the scale.  This type of scale is used when\nvariations of the measured quantity are small and usually fall in the expanded area of the scale, thus\npermitting more accurate readings.  Figure 13-2 shows an analog switchboard power factor meter with a\nnonlinear scale.\nFigure 13-2:  Nonlinear Scale Power Factor Meter.  Courtesy of Yokogawa.\n13.2.6  Operating Procedures\nInstruments furnish valuable and indispensable information on the performance of an electric system or\ndevice. Without this information, the operator would be almost completely uninformed and would have to\ndepend upon some crude or often inaccurate observations.  Any abnormal indication should be\nimmediately investigated.\n13.2.6.1  Reading Instrument Scales:  The best instrument will serve no purpose unless properly read\nand correctly interpreted.  Good lighting is essential to accurate reading; glare as a result of reflection of\nconcentrated light should be avoided.  Newer instruments have special covers to reduce glare.  Some\ninstruments are direct reading in that the scales directly furnish the values of the measured quantities,\nwhereas other instruments require the use of instrument constants called scale factors.  In this latter case\nthe actual measured quantity is obtained by multiplying the instrument indication as shown on the scale\nby the scale factor.  The scale factor may be shown on the instrument or may be associated with the\nposition of an instrument switch.  In the latter case, each position of the instrument switch will represent a\ndifferent scale factor.\nEXAMPLE 13-1 :  An ac ammeter with 0 to 5 ampere scale and 50 divisions has its indicating pointer\nlocated on the 35 division point.  The scale factor is 20 as shown on the ammeter switch.  The measured\nvalue is:\nAmperes70  20  505 35Factor ScaleDivisions TotalScale Reading Instrument= = xxxx"

Instrument covers should be tightly fastened to the case to prevent entrance of\ndust or fumes.  Instruments should not be left for extended periods without covers.\n13.2.6.2.1  Switchboard Instruments :  These instruments are rather rugged devices, but should be\nprotected from excessive vibration and shock.  The instruments should be kept clean to facilitate reading\nof the measured quantity.\n13.2.6.2.2  Recording Instruments :  Recording instruments require additional care if they contain\nprinters or floppy disk drives.  The instrument should be located in a dry place and kept clean.  Printers\nshould be checked periodically to ensure they have a sufficient paper supply and are printing legibly.\nDisks placed in disk drives should be monitored for sufficient storage space. It may be necessary to\nreplace the disk periodically, depending on the amount of information being stored.\n13.3 METERS\n13.3.1  Definition\nAn electric meter is a device that measures and registers the integral of an electrical quantity with respect\nto time.  The term “meter” is also used in a general sense to designate any type of measuring device\nincluding all types of electrical measuring instruments.  Use of “meter” as a suffix to a compound word\n(e.g., voltmeter, ammeter, frequency meter) is universally accepted.  However, in this chapter the narrow\nmeaning of “electric meter” is used.\n13.3.2  Types of Electric Meters\nThe most common types of electric meters are watt-hour meter, VAR-hour meter, and ampere-hour\nmeter.\n13.3.2.1  Watt-Hour Meter :  The watt-hour meter is an electric meter that measures and registers\nelectric energy in watthours or kilowatt-hours (1,000 watt-hours).\nEXAMPLE 13-2:  If the active electric power of a circuit is 15 kW and is consumed at a uniform rate for\n3 hours, the watt-hour meter will register 3 x 15 = 45 kWh.\n13.3.2.2  VAR-Hour Meter:   A VAR-hour meter is an electric meter that measures and registers\nreactive power in reactive volt-ampere-hours (or reactive kilovolt-ampere-hours).\n13.3.2.3  Ampere-Hour Meter:   An ampere-hour meter is an electric meter that registers the quantity\nof electricity in ampere-hours.\n13.3.3  Demand Meter\nA demand meter is a device that indicates or records the maximum average load over any specified time\ninterval (usually one hour or less) or the average load over a number of equal time intervals.  It is a\nspecial form of electric meter indicating or recording the measured load for a given time interval and then\nresetting."

An electric meter usually has a register,\nwhich registers the integrating load.  The demand meter has an indicating, graphic (recording), printing,\nor digital device. Digital device meters may also have communications circuitry to permit remote\nmonitoring of the measured quantities.\n13.3.5.1  Electric Meter Registers and Register Constants:   The registers are the prime concern of\nthe operators since the registers furnish the magnitude of electrical energy consumed by the load.\n13.3.5.1.1  Register :  The meter register may be dial (pointer) type or cyclometric (digital) type.  In the\ndial-type register, four or five dials are used to show the quantity measured.  The register reads from left\nto right with the highest reading on the four-dial register 9999 and on the five-dial register 99999.  The\ncyclometric register usually consists of four numbered rotating discs with the applicable number on each\ndisc visible through a slot on a plate in front of the register.\n13.3.5.1.2  Register Constant :  The register or dial constant of a meter is the multiplier used to convert\nthe register reading to the actual measured value.  Its value may be 1, 10, or any multiple of 10. Another\nconstant, used with watt-hour meters, is the watt-hour constant, which is the registration of one revolution\nof the meter disc expressed in watt-hours.  This constant is used only when calibrating watt-hour meters,\nbut can be used to calculate the register constant.  The register constant is usually marked on the meter\nregister, and the watt-hour constant is shown on the meter nameplate.\n13.3.5.1.3  Electronic Register :  Many modern electric meters have electronic registers.  The electronic\nregister displays the quantity measured on a liquid crystal display (LCD) or other electronic screen.\nTypically the units of the measured quantity are also displayed.  No multiplier is required to convert the\ndisplayed value to the actual measured value.\n13.3.5.2  Indicating Demand Meter:   This meter has a sweep hand to indicate the maximum demand\nfor any given period.  This period might be 15, 30, or 60 minutes.  The maximum demand indicating hand\nis generally reset every month when the watt-hour meter reading is obtained.\n13.3.5.3  Recording Demand Meter:   This meter may be found in existing installations but is\ngenerally not specified for new construction.  The recording meter records the demand for each given\ndemand period on either a round or strip chart.  This chart, therefore, indicates all the demands over a\ngiven period.  The maximum demand is determined by inspection of the meter chart.\n13.3.5.4  Contact Device:  This was originally a pair of contacts on a cam geared to the rotating disc\nshaft of the watt-hour meter to produce a series of pulses.  The pulse rate was directly proportional to the\nspeed at which the meter disc rotated.  On more recent analog types, a second slotted disc geared to the"

The resultant voltage pulse train produced is\namplified and applied to a reed relay to produce a contact pulse output.\n13.3.5.5  Totalizer:  This solid-state device receives pulse trains from several watt-hour meters and\nproduces a single output pulse train proportional to the sum of the inputs.  Inputs may be additive or\nsubtractive.\n13.3.5.6  Demand Meter Constant:   The constant of a demand meter is the multiplier used to convert\nthe indicated or recorded demand reading on the meter to actual measured values.  This constant may be\n1, 10, or a multiple of 10.  The demand meter constant and the register constant on the watt-hour meter do\nnot necessarily have the same value.\n13.3.5.7  Digital Memory:   Electronic meters typically have digital memory that will retain measured\nvalues for a defined period.  The values may be stored in random access memory (RAM) or on a magnetic\nmedium such as a tape drive, hard drive, or floppy disk.  The values stored in digital memory can be read\nby a computer connected to the digital memory device via local connection or through a communications\nlink.\n13.3.6  Connection of Watt-Hour and VAR-Hour Meters\nWatt-hour and VAR-hour meters have to have both current and potential connections to measure the\nactive and reactive energy.  Watt-hour and VAR-hour meters are classified with respect to circuit\nconnections and the type of load being measured.\n13.3.6.1  Self-Contained Watt-Hour and VAR-Hour Meters:   The current and potential coils of\nself-contained meters are connected directly to the circuit.  These meters are normally used where the\ncircuit voltage does not exceed 240 volts and the continuous load does not exceed 30 amperes.  Self-\ncontained watt-hour meters for 200- and even 400-ampere continuous load currents and 480 volts circuit\nvoltage are available but are usually only used in special cases.\n13.3.6.2  Transformer-Type Meters:   The current and potential coils of transformer-type meters are\nconnected to the circuit by means of current and potential transformers. These meters are normally used\nwhen the circuit voltage exceeds 240 volts and/or the current is above 200 amperes.  Current transformers\nare used to reduce the current to the meter to 5 amperes at rated load.  Potential transformers are used to\nreduce the voltage to the meter to 120 volts.\n13.3.6.3  Single-Phase Watt-Hour Meter:   Both self-contained and transformer-type meters may be\nused for single-phase systems.  These meters have only one current and one potential coil.  The\ntransformer-type meter is usually equipped with a small indicating lamp to show when the potential coil\nis energized.  This is important where the secondary of the potential transformer is fused.\n13.3.6.4  Three-Phase, Two-Element Watt-Hour Meter:   These meters have two current and two\npotential coils and are used on three-phase, three-wire systems.  Transformer-type meters require two\ncurrent transformers and two potential transformers.  The meters often have two small indicating lamps to\nshow when the two potential coils of the watt-hour meter are energized.\n13.3.6.5  Three-Phase, Two and a Half-Element Watt-Hour Meter:   These meters have three\ncurrent coils and two potential coils and are used on three-phase, four-wire systems where the error due to\nvoltage unbalances on the three-phase system can be neglected.  Transformer-type meters require three"

Transformer-type meters require three potential transformers and three\ncurrent transformers.  There are three potential indica ting lamps to show when the three potential coils are\nenergized.\n13.4 MULTI-FUNCTION METERS\n13.4.1  Definition\nA multi-function meter is a combination device that performs the functions of instruments, transducers,\nand meters.  It is flexible, allowing the user to monitor many quantities simultaneously.  It contains a\ncentral processing unit (CPU) for the calculation and digital display of desired quantities.  Most multi-\nfunction meters can be user configured to normally display a few quantities simultaneously while all\nquantities can be read using push buttons on the front of the device or via remote monitoring.  Many\nmulti-function meters also have digital memory for storing measured quantities recorded over a defined\nperiod.  Stored quantities can be downloaded to a laptop computer or other digital device.  Figure 13-3\nshows a multi-function meter.\nFigure 13-3:  Multi-Function Meter.  Courtesy of Bitronics ."

The instrument transformer ratios are set at the factory but may be\nchanged in the field.  Once the instrument transformer ratios are set, the meter will calculate and display\nprimary values with correct units.  No scale factors are required to accurately read the meter display.\n13.4.3  Measured and Calculated Values\nMulti-function meters can measure and calculate many electrical quantities including instantaneous volts,\namps, watts, VARs, volt-amperes, power factor, and hertz.  The meter may also record the instantaneous\nmaximum and minimum for each of these values over a pre-defined period.  Accumulating quantities that\ncan be calculated include watt-hours and VAR-hours.  The latest versions of multifunction meters are\nincorporating programmable alarm levels and various power quality measurements.  The meter can also\ninitiate communications to a remote master or PC when certain events or levels are measured.\n13.4.4  Communications\nMulti-function meters may communicate with remote terminal units ( RTUs), programmable logic\ncontrollers ( PLCs), human–machine interfaces ( HMIs), and other digital devices via local\ncommunications network, common telephone lines, radio, or carrier signals coupled to power circuits.\nLocal network hardware typically conforms with either RS-232 or RS-485 standards.  Additional\nhardware and software requirements are defined by the communications protocol specified for the local\ncommunications network.

Substation automation uses intelligent electronic devices in the substation to provide enhanced\nintegrated and coordinated monitoring and control capabilities.  Substation automation may include traditional\nSCADA equipment, but more often encompasses traditional SCADA functionality while providing extended\nmonitoring and control capabilities through the use of non-traditional system elements.\nIn the traditional SCADA system (legacy system), a host computer system (master station) located at the\nenergy control center communicates with remote terminal units located in the substations.  RTUs are\ntraditionally “dumb” (non-intelligent) devices with very limited or no capability to perform local unsupervised\ncontrol.  Control decisions are processed in the master station and then carried out by the RTU through the\nuse of discrete electromechanical control relays in the RTU.  Analog telemetry information (watts, VARs,\nvolts, amps, etc.) is generated by discrete transducers whose outputs are wired into the RTU.  Device status\n(breaker position, load tap changer position, etc.) is monitored by the RTU through sensing of discrete\ncontacts on these devices.  Monitored data is multiplexed by the RTU and communicated back to the master\nstation computer in the form of asynchronous serial data.\nSubstation automation systems do include many of the same basic elements as the legacy SCADA system but\nwith significant enhancements.  A central operations computer system generally provides the master station\nfunction.  Legacy RTUs may be incorporated into the automation scheme, particularly in retrofit situations,\nbut are generally replaced with intelligent programmable RTUs and other IEDs in an integrated LAN.  Legacy\ntransducers are replaced by IEDs that provide not only the traditional analog signals, but a number of\nadditional data values that can be useful to operations, engineering, and management personnel.  IEDs\ncommunicate with RTUs and local processors via a substation LAN with an open communications protocol,\nthereby eliminating discrete transducer analog signals.  Programmable logic controllers ( PLCs) may be\nincluded, discretely or integrated into the intelligent RTU, to provide closed loop control and control functions,\nthereby eliminating the need for many electromechanical relays and interlocks.\nThe integration of IEDs in the substation has been a major challenge for electric utilities and\nequipment suppliers.  The primary obstacle has been the lack of standards for LAN\ncommunications protocols, with manufacturers opting for proprietary protocols that require\ncostly interface modules for protocol conversion.   Strides have been made in recent years to resolve\nthe protocol standardization problems, and some de facto standards have emerged.  The trend will continue\ntoward more vendor-independent substation network environments as these standardization efforts move\nforward and as the level of standards support improves among IED manufacturers. \n14.2 OPEN VS. PROPRIETARY SYSTEMS\nAll exchange of data among networked computers and devices may be thought of as part of a network\narchitecture, that is, a framework that provides the necessary physical and communications services to\nfacilitate data exchange.  Any number of internally consistent architectures can be chosen to permit the\ndesired communications; however, many are proprietary.  Proprietary networking solutions can prove to be"

But proprietary networks do have the advantage that the\nuser has access to a single point of contact and responsibility at the system vendor for all network functions,\nand these networks are generally guaranteed to “plug and play” without the user having to be concerned about\narchitectures and protocols.  A cautionary statement for proprietary systems is needed here.  If or when the\nvendor or his product becomes obsolete, ensure someone will handle support services for this network.  An\nescrow account for the source code of the system is a good starting point.  This allows future modifications\nto the system without having to re-engineer the entire system.\nIn a network based on open products and standards, the user is no longer dependent on a single vendor to\nprovide the functions and features needed or desired.  The user also has the advantage of being able to solicit\ncompetitive prices among equipment vendors rather than being locked into one source of supply.  But in an\nopen environment, the user has to take responsibility for overall network functionality, and has to take care in\nthe selection of protocols and equipment to ensure “plug-and-play” compatibility.\nTwo widely accepted open system architectures are the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)\nOpen Systems Interconnection (OSI) 7-layer model, and the Transport Control Protocol/Internet Protocol\n(TCP/IP) model. TCP/IP was originally developed for the ARPAnet, now called the Internet, but has been\nwidely used in local area networks.  A more recent development is the Utility Communications Architecture\n(UCA), which is a family of OSI-compliant protocols developed by EPRI for use in electric utilities.  UCA is\ndiscussed in greater detail in Section 14.4.6.2, Utility Communications Architecture.\n14.3 SUBSTATION AUTOMATION ARCHITECTURE\nThe basic architecture of a utility automation system can be viewed as a multi-layered stack (Figure 14 -1).  At\nthe bottom of the stack are the electrical power substation field devices (transformers, breakers, switches,\netc.).  The top of the stack is the user interface where data and control prerogatives are presented to the end\nuser, which in this case would be a human operator.  The intermediate layers may be implemented with\ndiscrete elements or subsystems.  In some cases, several levels may be combined into one, or even eliminated\naltogether.\nThe overall architecture can be viewed as two layers, each made up of several sublayers.  The first or lowest\nlayer, the data acquisition and control layer, is made up of substation-resident equipment.  The second or\nhighest layer, the utility enterprise, can be viewed as the information infrastructure layer.  This bulletin\nfocuses on the substation-resident data acquisition and control layer.\n14.4 DATA ACQUISITION AND CONTROL ELEMENTS\nSubstation automation may take many different forms and levels of sophistication, depending on the\nphilosophy of the implementing utility and the specific application.  For instance, a single serial data interface\nbetween a SCADA RTU and an electronic recloser would be an example of a relatively simple and limited\napplication.  A fully automated substation with digital relays, electronic reclosers, and programmable logic\ncontrollers, all sharing a common network with a substation host processor and man–machine interface,\nwould represent a relatively sophisticated application.  Figure 14-2 shows the"

A Windows-type graphical user interface\nshould be provided.\nFor smaller substations, a single non-redundant processor should suffice.  For larger and more critical\nsubstations, a dual-redundant processor with automatic failover is recommended.  The level of redundancy\ncalled for will vary by application, depending on what functions the host processor is providing, the level of\nelectromechanical backup employed, and the operational risks and implications related to an extended failure\nof the processor.\n14.4.2  Intelligent Electronic Devices\nExamples of IEDs are electronic multifunction meters, digital relays, programmable logic controllers ( PLCs),\ndigital fault recorders, sequence of events recorders, voltage regulators, capacitor bank controllers, and\nelectronic reclosers.  Intelligent SCADA RTUs and PLCs can also be considered IEDs but are typically\ncategorized separately.\nMany IEDs perform two functions within the substation.  First, the IED provides its primary design function\nsuch as relaying, capacitor control, or voltage regulation.  But by virtue of the fact that many of these IEDs\nhave built-in instrument transformers, or are otherwise connected to the potential transformer (PT) and/or\ncurrent transformers (CT) circuits of the substation, the IEDs also calculate and provide a large amount of\npower system data. \nData available from IEDs includes but is not necessarily limited to the following information: \n1. Power flows (kilowatts, kilovars, power factor, phase angle, kilowatt-hours, kilovar-hours)\n2. Other electrical data values (amperes, volts, symmetrical components)\n3. Fault current (per phase, ground, waveform capture)\n4. Relaying targets\n5. Sequence of events\n6. Oscilliography\nData is retrieved from the IED by the substation host processor and/or a local RTU digitally via a serial data\nport or other network interface.  This eliminates the need for discrete analog tranducers, accomplishing a\nsignificant reduction in space and wiring, which can also lead to cost reductions, particularly on new (as\nopposed to retrofitted) substations.\nA single IED can often deliver hundreds of data values even though the utility user is only interested in a small\nsubset of the total data set.  The ability to filter the data reported by the IED has been limited as a result of\nboth hardware and protocol-related issues.  The goal is to provide the capability to filter or “mask” certain\ndata registers at the IED level, as opposed to making this function protocol or host-dependent. \nIEDs should be individually addressable, preventing the need for a dedicated communications channel for each\nIED.  IEDs should support open protocols such as DNP 3.0, ModBus, ASCII, UCA 2.0, IEC 870-5-101 or\n103, or TCP/IP (see Section 14.4.6, Communication Protocols).\nAn important design consideration in development of IED interfaces is the data acquisition method.  For\nexample, the IEDs  may be polled by the host device for changes (report by exception), or the IEDs may be\nsequentially scanned (full data dump).  In the more common instance of a full scan, it is important to quantify\nany limitations on the maximum allowable latency of the data (the time required for changes to appear in the"

These issues may play a role in the selection of IEDs and/or the\ncommunication protocol and method.\n14.4.3  Programmable Logic Controllers\nPLCs may be considered IEDs, but are often considered as a separate class of device.  Most IEDs are\ndesigned to provide a primary function, such as reclosing, voltage regulation, relaying, or revenue metering,\nwhile also offering ancillary system data that has some additional benefit to the utility.  PLCs, on the other\nhand, are more generic and can perform a wide variety of automation functions on a user-programmable\nbasis. \nPLCs have traditionally been used in industrial applications such as assembly line automation.  PLCs have also\nbeen widely used in power generating station distributed control systems, but have only recently been applied\nin electric utility substations.  One of the reasons for the lack of penetration by PLCs into the substation data\nacquisition and control industry was that PLCs have only recently begun to be manufactured to rigorous\nsubstation environmental and electrical standards, such as ANSI Std. C37.90a surge withstand capability. \nAnother recent development is that, with the advent of faster microprocessors, PLCs can now perform\nsophisticated control procedures fast enough to meet the requirements of substation protective relaying. \nPLCs are now finding applications in substations that were traditionally the realm of legacy SCADA RTUs.\nPLCs can provide the same monitoring and supervisory control functions as an RTU.  But PLCs offer the\nadvantages of lower costs than RTUs in some configurations, and ladder logic programmability not available\nin the legacy RTUs.  In an attempt to combat the influx of PLC products into their traditional markets, RTU\nmanufacturers have begun to offer lower cost RTUs with intelligent programmable features. The increased\nintelligence and programmability of the RTU compared with the PLC’s same features should make the\ndefining border between the two obsolete.\nIn addition to providing traditional SCADA functions, PLCs are being used by utilities for a wide variety of\nautomation functions:\n1. Reclosing\n2. Auto-sectionalizing\n3. Power line carrier automatic check-back schemes\n4. Transformer LTC control\n5. Capacitor controller\n6. Local HMI for alarm annunciator, metering indication, data logging, and events recording\n7. Breaker control, especially for more complex operations such as tie breakers\n8. Breaker tripping for more complex schemes requiring a significant number of inputs\nThe programmability of PLCs lends to the development of schemes that were previously considered very\ndifficult to actuate.  If the input can be obtained, the ladder logic to make decisions regarding the input can be\nwritten to produce an output.  Future additions to the substation may also be made simpler since the\nsubstation wiring is made easier and logic may be readily changed with the use of PLCs.\nSome utilities, because of the complexity of their control schemes, have used PLCs as a control device\nbetween relays and breakers to provide tripping and closing of the breakers.  While this is not generally\nrecommended, the use of PLCs minimizes installation time because of reduced wiring and control checkout\nsince the logic for any scheme may be entered into the ladder logic."

The data\nconcentration function is primarily the integration of multiple incompatible IED protocols for presentation to\nan external host under a single unified protocol.\nThe role of the data concentrator is changing with the advent of UCA (see Section 14.4.6.2, Utility\nCommunications Architecture).  UCA will allow for direct communications to all IEDs, regardless of whether\nthe communication is internal or external to the substation.  But data concentrators may still be desirable for\nbandwidth efficiency in low-bandwidth wide area telecommunications links.\n14.4.5  Substation Local Area Network\nThe substation LAN provides a means of physical data transfer between intelligent devices in the substation.\nThere are two main distinctions between various LAN types: access method and physical media.  The access\nmethod, physical media, and transmission rate of the network in megabits per second (Mbps) will also dictate\nthe maximum distance between communicating devices (nodes).\n14.4.5.1  Physical Media:   The physical media used in LANs include coaxial cable, UTP (unshielded\ntwisted-pair) copper, and optical fiber. \nOptical fiber, because of its immunity to electrical effects, has distinct advantages in an electrical substation\nenvironment.  Coaxial cables and UTP can experience loss or corruption of data messages as a result of\nelectrical transients.  Even though protocols at various layers can mitigate some of these adverse effects, it is\nrecommended that fiber-optic media be used to connect all IEDs engaged in protection functions.\n14.4.5.2  Access Method:   The access method can take various forms.  The most common methods\nare carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD), token ring, and token bus, and the\nFiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI), although a number of vendor-proprietary schemes are also in use. \nIn selecting an access method, the designer has to consider the expected loading of the network, whether or\nnot a deterministic access method (see below) is required, desired data rate, and the physical distances\nbetween nodes or communicating devices.\nNetworks that use CSMA/CD are generally referred to as Ethernet networks, although this is not always true.\n Ethernet is actually a proprietary access method developed by Digital Equipment Corporation, but was the\nbasis for the IEEE 802.3 networking standards.  CSMA/CD is a broadcast access method where multiple\ndevices contend for access to the same communications medium in a bus architecture.  It is a non-\ndeterministic method, meaning that the amount of time required for a message to be sent and received cannot\nbe accurately determined, and is best applied in lightly loaded networks.  Its non-deterministic behavior is a\ndisadvantage for time-critical automation tasks like closed-loop control.  CSMA/CD is supported under\nUCA  2.0.\nToken ring (IEEE Std. 802.5) is the most commonly used token passing access method.  Unlike CSMA/CD,\nthis method is deterministic because token passing among communicating devices is used to govern access to\nthe communications medium.  Token ring is supported under UCA 2.0.\nToken bus (IEEE Std. 802.4) is a bus access method like CSMA/CD, but uses a token passing arrangement\nfor deterministic medium access.  Token bus, like token ring, is supported under UCA 2.0, but is less\ncommonly used than token ring or CSMA/CD."

FDDI is primarily used as a backbone network\nto connect multiple lower speed LANs in a large building or campus environment, so would be less commonly\nused in a substation environment.  Also, with the advent of 100 Mbps CSMA/CD, asynchronous transfer\nmode switching and synchronous optical network technology, FDDI usage should wane in the coming years.\nATM is dedicated-connection switching technology that organizes digital data into packets and transmits them\nusing digital signal technology.  Due to ATM’s ease in implementation by hardware, faster processing speeds\nare possible.  ATM runs on a layer on top of SONET.  SONET is the U.S. (ANSI) standard for synchronous\ndata transmission on optical media.  This standard ensures the interconnection between networks and that\nexisting conventional transmission systems can take advantage of optical media through tributary connections.\n Utilizing this technology can bring data speeds of 155.520 Mbps or 622.080 Mbps.  Faster speeds are\nexpected in the near future.  These two technologies are a major component of broadband ISDN (BISDN). \nFDDI usage should wane in the coming years because of this technology.\n14.4.5.3  Serial Data Interfaces:   Communications between intelligent devices in the substation may\ntake the form of synchronous or asynchronous serial connections rather than a LAN connection.  Most RTU\nvendors, for instance, offer serial ports on their RTUs for interfacing to IEDs with standard protocols.  The\nmost common standard serial interfaces are RS-232, RS-422/423, and RS-485.  Like LANs, these standards\ndefine a physical and electrical interface and do not imply a particular protocol.\n14.4.5.3.1  RS-232 :  The industry’s most common serial interface standard, RS-232 is defined by\nANSI/TIA/EIA Std. 232-E.  It defines the interface between data communications equipment (DCE) and data\nterminating equipment (DTE) employing serial binary data exchange.  RS-232 signals are generally limited to\n50 feet or less without the use of special low-capacitance conductors.  \n14.4.5.3.2  RS-422/423 :  This standard serial interface is defined by ANSI/TIA/EIA Std. 422 that extends\nthe transmission speeds and distances beyond RS-232.  It provides for a balanced voltage interface with a\nhigh noise immunity.  RS-423  is the unbalanced version. \n14.4.5.3.3  RS-485 :  This standard serial interface is defined by ANSI/TIA/EIA Std. 485.  It provides for a\nbalanced voltage interface similar to RS-422, but uses tri-state drivers for multidrop or “daisy-chained”\napplications.  Because of its multidrop capability, this is the most common serial interface in substation data\ncommunications.\n14.4.6  Communication Protocols\n14.4.6.1  General:   For two devices to communicate successfully, not only they have to share a common\nphysical interface and access method (see Section 14.4.5, Substation LANs, and Section 14.4.5.3, Serial Data\nInterfaces), but they have to also share a common protocol.  A protocol is a formal set of conventions\ngoverning the formatting and relative timing of message exchange between communicating systems.  The\ncareful selection of communication protocols is essential for the successful deployment of substation\nautomation systems.\nThe prevalent approach among equipment manufacturers is to support several standard protocols.  One RTU\nvendor, for example, offers the end user a menu of 34 different protocols for the RTU-to-IED interface port,\nand a single RTU can support up to 4 of these protocols simultaneously."

These industry groups include the Institute of Electrical and\nElectronics Engineers (IEEE) Power Engineering Society Substations Committee, EPRI, and the National\nRural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA).\nIn 1994, the IEEE issued a trial use standard (IEEE Std. 1379) that recommended IEC 870-5 and DNP 3.0 as\nalternative standards for master station-to-RTU and RTU-to-IED communications.  DNP 3.0 has fostered the\nwidest support among vendors to date, making it somewhat of a de facto standard throughout the industry. \nOther protocols that have obtained wide support include ModBus, MMS, ASCII, and Landis & Gyr 8979.\nThe ISO-OSI 7- layer model is not described due to the complexity of the subject.  The user is only exposed\nto the application layer.  For a detailed description, see CRN’s Enterprise-Wide Data Integration in a\nDistribution Cooperative  (Project 95-12).\n14.4.6.1.1  Protocol Descriptions :\n• IEC 870-5, developed by IEC Technical Committee 57 Working Group 3, answered the need for a\nprotocol standard for telecontrol, teleprotection, and associated telecommunications for electric\nutility systems.\n• DNP 3.0, developed by GE Harris Canada (at the time Westronic, Inc.), was established to\nminimize the creation of new protocols used to communicate between SCADA devices.  The\nprotocol is designed for data acquisition and application control in the electric utility field.  This\nprotocol is maintained by the DNP Users Group.\n• ModBus  (ASCII and RTU) were developed by Modicon. These protocols define a message\nstructure that controllers are able to recognize and use; the protocol forms a common format for\nthe layout and contents of data messaging. \n• Manufacturing Message Specification (MMS) is an internationally standardized messaging system\nfor exchanging real-time data and supervisory control information between networked devices\nand/or computer applications in a manner that is independent of the application function being\nperformed or the developer of the device or application.  MMS is an international standard (ISO\n9506) that is developed and maintained by Technical Committee Number 184 (TC 184), Industrial\nAutomation, of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).\n• Landis & Gyr 8979 is another standard byte-oriented protocol commonly used in the utility\nmarketplace.\nA promising development in the effort to provide a universal open protocol standard is EPRI’s UCA, which is\ndescribed in Section 14.4.6.2.  IEEE Std. 1379 was intended to be an intermediate standard to fill the gap until\nthe UCA standard was completed.\nWhile there are “standard” protocols available, many of these are dynamic in that continuing development and\nenhancements are taking place.  Several versions of a particular protocol may exist in the marketplace.  Two\ndevices that claim support of the same protocol may indeed support different versions or revisions of the\nprotocol, resulting in some lack of interoperability.  To avoid such problems, it is incumbent on the design\nengineer to research and understand the history of the selected protocol, whether multiple versions exist, and"

The designer should also be informed as to any\nproprietary modifications to the standard protocol that may have been incorporated by potential equipment\nsuppliers as a means of optimizing its implementation with their devices.\nThe best way to avoid unforeseen protocol interoperability problems is to implement pre-engineered “plug-\nand-play” \u001finterfaces.  Equipment manufacturers should be required to demonstrate plug-and-play\ninteroperability between the specific devices in question, not just general compliance with a protocol, either\nthrough factory testing or in actual field installations.  If a new and untried interface is undertaken, the utility\nshould place the burden for protocol emulation and development on a single entity.  This will typically be the\nRTU manufacturer (in the case of RTU-to-IED interfaces) or the data concentrator manufacturer (in the case\nof multiple protocol integration).\n14.4.6.2  Utility Communications Architecture:   EPRI developed UCA based on the ISO/OSI\nstandards for data communications.  The overall goal of UCA is to provide interconnectivity and\ninteroperability between utility data communication systems for real-time information exchange.  UCA\nemploys the Manufacturing Messaging Specification (MMS) to define the language, semantics, and services\nfor real-time data acquisition and control throughout general utility operations.  Both the ISO/OSI and the\nTCP/IP networking models are currently supported under UCA.\nUCA Version 1.0 was adopted in 1991, providing a suite of selected protocols, with MMS as the\nrecommended protocol for real-time data acquisition and control applications.  But UCA 1.0 lacked detailed\nspecifications of how the protocols would actually be used in field devices.  UCA Version 2.0 addresses this\nproblem.\nThe development of UCA Version 2.0 at the substation level was facilitated by EPRI Project RP-3599,\n“Integrated Protection, Control and Data Acquisition,” in which numerous utilities and manufacturers\nparticipated, with American Electric Power (AEP) as the lead participant.  This work has generally been\ncompleted for power system devices with the issuance of UCA 2.0 General Object Models for Substation and\nFeeder Field Devices, Draft Version 0.7, December 1997 (GOMSFE).  The effort of the document is to\nmerge the substation and feeder automation work with that of UCA version 2.0 in order to produce common\ngeneric object models for implementation of UCA 2.0-compliant field devices in electric utilities.\nWork on UCA Version 2.0 continued in 1998 with the EPRI/AEP Utility Substation Communications Initiative\nProject.  A continuation of EPRI Project RP-3599, this project’s goal is to evaluate and recommend a UCA-\ncompliant substation LAN and to demonstrate IED interoperability.  This project includes implementation at 13\ndemonstration sites in the United States and Germany, with targeted completion in 1999.\nWork on the UCA standards should continue over the next few years.  A new IEEE subcommittee, SCC 36,\nwill oversee its further development."

Transformer cooling, oil pumps, and load tap changers\n2. Circuit breaker air compressors and charging motors\n3. Outdoor device heaters\n4. Outdoor lighting and receptacles\n5. Control house\na. Lighting and receptacles\nb. Heating, ventilating, and air conditioning\nc. Battery charger input\nd. Water well pump\n6. Motor-operated disconnecting switches\n15.1.2  Design Requirements\n15.1.2.1  Demand Load:   Tabulate the connected kVA of all substation ac loads and apply a demand\nfactor to each.  Demand kVA is used to size the auxiliary transformer(s).  Load diversity and load factor\nneed not be considered in this case.\nIn auxiliary transformer sizing, examine the substation growth rate.  If expansion is planned in the near\nfuture, consider the estimated demand load of the expansion in the transformer size.  If expansion is in the\nfar future, it may be economically advantageous to plan for the addition of a transformer at expansion\ntime.\n15.1.2.2  Number of Primary Feeds:   In small distribution substations one auxiliary transformer is\nusually sufficient.\nAs substation size increases, customer load criticality increases.  A decision has to be made as to\nredundancy of substation auxiliary services in light of economics and customer requirements.  Large\ntransmission substations, servicing large load blocks, and distribution stations, should have dual feeders\nserving two separate auxiliary transformers.\nWhen dual feeds are selected, locate two separate, independent sources so the loss of one will not affect\nservice of the other.  Designate the least reliable as the alternative supply.  A popular option to consider in\nthis case is the use of a tertiary winding of the power transformer as a normal source.\nAn alternative source could be a distribution feeder at a customer service level, 480 or 240 volts, single or\nthree phase.  Depending on auxiliary secondary voltage level selected, this could eliminate one\ntransformer."

When undergrounding within the substation property, even from an\noverhead source, direct-buried conduit is recommended.  A spare, capped, conduit should be installed to\nminimize down time if a cable failure occurs.  The faulted cable can always be removed after service\nrestoration.\n15.1.2.4  Critical Loads:   Some low-voltage loads have to be maintained at all times:\n1. Battery chargers which, through the batteries, supply breaker trip and close circuits as well as\ncommunication circuits\n2. Transformer cooling\n3. Power circuit breaker compressors and motors\n4. Trouble light receptacles in the station yard\n5. Security lighting\n6. Breaker control circuits\n7. Fire alarm circuit(s)\n8. Electric heating\n9. Substation automation circuitry\nCritical loads for each station should be determined.  These loads should be served from a panel(s) fed\nfrom the normal source and representing the minimum load for transfer to alternative supply.\n15.1.2.5  Secondary Voltage Level:   Several secondary voltage or utilization levels are available for\nac auxiliaries.  For the purposes of standardization, on a given power system it is best that only one level\nbe selected.  This is not a limiting rule, however.  An exception could be justified.\nPossible secondary voltage levels as illustrated in Figure 15-1 are as follows:\n1. 480/240 Volts, Three-Phase Delta\nThree-phase transformer fans and oil pumps need to be specified at 480 volts.  In practice, the units\nare rated at 460/230 volts, but this is inside the NEMA plus 10 percent voltage requirement.\nOther loads may be specified at either 480 or 240 volts, single phase.\nThis system is ungrounded and should be used with a ground detection system so that a “fault” or\none leg of the system will cause an alarm.  The system should trip when a second leg on the system\nis grounded.\n2. 480/277 Volts, Wye Connected, Three-Phase, Four-Wire\nThree-phase transformer fans and oil pumps need to be specified at 480 volts.  In practice, the\nmotors are rated 460/230 volts, but this is within the NEMA plus 10 percent voltage requirement.\nThe advantage here is that luminaires can be equipped with 277-volt ballasts, saving lighting\ntransformer costs over use of more common 120-volt lamped luminaires.  Convenience receptacles\nare fed through small dry-type 480-120 volt transformers."

Combination power and lighting panels can be used, resulting in reduced\nlabor and material costs.  This saving could be offset by higher conductor costs as compared to the\n480-volt system.  Receptacles can be served with 120 volts directly.\n4. 240 Volts, Three-Phase Delta\nThree-phase transformer fans and oil pumps need to be specified at 240 volts.  In practice, the\nmotors are rated at 230 volts, but this is inside the NEMA plus 10 percent voltage requirements.\nThis system is ungrounded and should be used with a ground detection system so that a “fault” on\none leg of the system will cause an alarm.  The system should trip when a second leg on the system\nis grounded.\n5. 240/120 Volts, Delta-Connected, Three-Phase, Four-Wire\nThis is the most common level in use in moderate-size substations.  One phase of the auxiliary\ntransformer is center tapped to obtain 120 volts .  Combination panels can be used, and 240-volt\nsingle-phase loads can be served.\n6. 240/120 Volts, Open Delta-Connected, Three-Phase, Four-Wire\nThis is essentially the same as the closed delta connection except only 58 percent of the kVA\ncapacity of the three transformers can be used.  This configuration will provide construction\neconomy for a medium-size installation or for temporary use.  With single-phase units, the third\ntransformer can be added in the future for increased kVA capacity.  It is frequently used for\nconstruction power where both three-phase and single-phase supplies are required.\n7. 240/120 Volts, Single-Phase, Three-Wire\nThis is “residential” service but applicable to small substations.  Common panels can be used, with\ntwo available voltages.\n15.1.2.6  Transfer Scheme:   Where two sources, normal and alternative, are feeding substation\nauxiliaries, a means to transfer from one to the other has to be established.  At an attended station this can\nbe a manual transfer arrangement.  Automatic transfer has to be provided at an unattended station.\nTransfer is done on the secondary side for equipment economy.  Article 700 of the National Electrical\nCode  (NEC ) outlines general requirements for this type of scheme.  A typical configuration is shown in\nFigure 15-2.\nTransfer switch selection is an important factor in the system design.  Operation should be “break before\nmake” double-throw operation to prevent shorting the two sources.  Mechanical interlocking should be\nprovided to ensure the switch can be in only one of the two positions.  The switch should have an ampere\nwithstand capability for faults at points A, B, and C of Figure 15-2.  The fault at C will be highest, the\nfeeder impedance to B and A limiting the fault current to an amount below that at C.\nThe auxiliary system in Figure 15-2 assumes transfer of all loads.  The full load current of the 150 kVA\ntransformer is 360 amperes, so a 400-ampere switch would be selected."

Additionally, the number of branch circuit devices in one\nenclosure is limited to 42 poles.\nSwitchboards differ from panelboards in that switchboards are free standing.  Front or rear access to line\nand load terminals are vendor options.  Branches can be group mounted or individually mounted, with or\nwithout barriers.\nEnclosures should be specified NEMA 1, general service for indoor use, or NEMA 3R, raintight for\noutdoor use.\nPanelboards are available for flush or surface mounting, with fusible or circuit breaker branch circuits.\nMain breakers, if required, can be furnished.  Voltage ratings for any level selected from Section 15.1.2.5\ncan be supplied.\nThe main decision to be made in panelboard selection is whether to use fusible or circuit breaker\nbranches.  The branch circuit device is used to protect the branch circuit wiring, so the decision should be\nbased on first cost and maintainability.  For a very small installation with few circuits, fuses will mean\nlower first cost.\nIf fuses are selected, an inventory has to be maintained at the substation.  There is always the possibility,\nhowever remote, that the wrong size could be used as replacement for a blown fuse.  These problems do\nnot exist with circuit breakers, a plus factor relative to maintainability.\nFor lighting circuit service exclusively, in a moderately sized installation, a circuit breaker panelboard\noffers the advantage of switching the lights, thereby eliminating light switches.  For exterior lighting, the\nengineer may consider mounting a weatherproof three-pole magnetic contactor fed from an adjacent\noutdoor panel.\n15.1.3.3  Lighting and Heating Equipment :  Outdoor lighting serves two basic purposes: substation\nsecurity and safety.  Depending on the area, certain luminaires may be used during hours of darkness for\nsubstation security.  These are photoelectrically controlled.  A microwave tower could require FAA\nlighting.  This would also be controlled photoelectrically.\nLamps for outdoor use are essentially incandescent, mercury, or sodium lamps.  Except for an unusual\ncondition, the lamps presently in use on a given system should continue in use, simplifying inventory.\nThe unusual condition could be a new large substation where a different source is desirable and a\nseparate, on-station inventory can be kept.\nLuminaires for substation use, from the basic flat dome reflector to Illuminating Engineering Society\n(IES) pattern refractors, are available.  Pole-top or bracket mountings can be used.  The engineer, with the\nproper vendor data, can develop a lighting layout to satisfy the purpose required.  Yard lighting design is\nbeyond the scope of this guide.  The basic requirements are one or two foot-candles in equipment areas.\nConvenience receptacles should be in equipment cabinets and also strategically located to serve 50-foot\nextension cords with trouble lights.  Convenience receptacles in the substation yard should have ground\nfault interruption protection."

One or two auxiliary transformers to reduce the primary voltage to the utilization level.\nc. A main switchboard, usually located outdoors between the two transformers.  This\nswitchboard houses the transfer switch and fuses or circuit breakers to feed both control house\nand yard panelboards.\nPanelboards (indoor or outdoor) having circuit breakers or fuses sized for the loads involved should have\napproximately 20 percent spare breakers or fuses.\nAll branch circuit breakers feeding ac yard circuits shall be Ground Fault Interrupting type (GFI).

    "content": "Bulletin 1724E-300\nPage 681\n15.2.2  Design Requirements\nA substation dc system consists of a battery of suitable voltage (number of cells) and suitable size\n(ampere-hour capacity) connected in parallel with a control bus together with properly selected voltage-\nregulated charging equipment.\nAt a single location where two distinct dc voltages are required, i.e., possibly 48 volts for microwave and\n120 volts for substation operation, two separate batteries and chargers is one option.  Tapping a larger unit\nto obtain the smaller voltage is not recommended.  Another option to obtain different dc voltages is a dc-\nto-dc converter.  This is usually used for small loads and is available from the manufacturer.\nThe charging equipment consists of a full wave rectifier with regulated output voltage.  Normally, the\ncharger operates continuously to furnish direct current to the control bus for steady loads such as\nindicating lamps, holding coils, and relays, plus a small current to maintain the battery at full charge.\nIntermittent loads of short duration such as tripping or closing of circuit breakers or automatic operation\nof other equipment are handled by the charger within the limits of its capacity.  Any excess load is\nsupplied by the battery, which is automatically recharged when the intermittent load ceases.  Should the\nac input to the charger fail, the battery carries the entire load .\nThe control bus may be a dc bus in a switchgear assembly or, in the case of a large substation, a dc or\ngroup of dc panels.\nDC voltage requirements for solid-state relaying, event recorders, data acquisition, and other such devices\nare generally below the voltage levels for circuit breaker trip coils.  Actual requirements vary with\ndifferent vendors.  Some types of equipment are provided with individual rectifiers, rack mounted,\nchanging 120 volts, 60 hertz ac, to 12, 24, or 48 volts dc.  If the ac supply fails, static switching changes\nthe source to the main dc batteries and required dc converter.  An alarm indication is provided to indicate\nthis status.  Other equipment is designed to be fed directly from the main batteries with ac/dc converters\nto supply the static device voltage.\nTwo of the most important components of a substation dc system are the main battery and charger. These\ncomponents should be sized correctly. Undersizing could possibly mean a circuit breaker reclose failure\nand undue service interruption.  Oversizing, while not damaging, is expensive. However, the cost of the\nsupply is a fraction of total substation cost, and the economics should be balanced with reliability.  At a\nminimum, the main battery should be sized to allow normal substation operation for 8 hours.\n15.2.3  Types of Cells\nBefore determining the cell ampere-hour rating, the type of cell for the particular application has to be\nselected. There is no need for cell standardization on a power system.  Once a battery is installed for\nstationary service, it stays in place for up to 30 years.  Interchangeability on the system is unnecessary.\nThe types of secondary cells readily available today are:\n1. Lead acid\n2. Nickle cadmium (NI-CAD)\n3. Lead calcium\nA brief description of the three predominant types follows.  For theory and history too lengthy to be\nconsidered here, see Batteries and Energy Systems  by Dr. C.L. Mantell."

Number of deep discharges required over the life of the battery\n15.2.3.1  Lead Acid Cell:   This cell has a positive plate of lead peroxide and a negative plate of pure\nsponge lead.  The electrolyte is dilute sulphuric acid.  Open circuit voltage of a fully charged cell is a\nnominal 2.25 volts; voltage varies depending on electrolyte strength and cell temperature.\nBattery condition can be determined with a hydrometer using Equation 15-2:\nEquation 15-2\nWhere:\nS. G. =Specific gravity of the electrolyte\nThe specific gravity of the electrolyte varies with cell temperature, so a thermometer should be a part of\nthe maintenance kit.  The higher the temperature, the lower the specific gravity.  Battery ratings are\nusually specified at 25ºC (77ºF).  Temperature correction curves are included with the battery\nmanufacturer’s instruction manual, as are charge and discharge curves.\n15.2.3.2  Nickel Cadmium:   This cell has a positive plate of nickel hydrate and a negative plate of\ncadmium sponge.  The electrolyte is a solution of potassium hydroxide with a specific gravity from 1.160\nto 1.190 at 25ºC (77ºF).  Open-circuit voltage may vary from 1.30 to 1.38 volts. The cell voltage is\n1.4 volts fully charged at 25ºC (77ºF).  The specific gravity of the electrolyte is constant regardless of\ncharge state.\nThe nickel cadmium battery has the advantages of infrequent maintenance requirements, absence of\ncorrosive fumes, immunity to inadvertent overcharge, and the reduced derating required for ambient\ntemperatures below 25ºC (77ºF).  The absence of corrosive sulphuric acid fumes allows the installation of\n“NI-CADS” in cubicles, a possible advantage in some installations.  The primary reason for the lack of\ngreater use of NI-CADS for main substation batteries is initial cost.\n15.2.3.3  Lead Calcium:   This cell is similar to the lead acid type with the exception of the addition of\napproximately 0.8 percent calcium to the lead grid for additional strength. This alloy also greatly reduces\ncell internal losses.\n15.2.4  Typical Loads and Duty Cycle\nTo accurately specify a battery and associated charger, the dc load has to be accurately defined.  Each\nsingle item of equipment connected to the dc system has to be individually tabulated with the following\npertinent data included:\n• Voltage\n• Current requirement\n• Duration of operationCell Volts = S.

For the purpose\nof this guide, a 120-volt battery with a nominal voltage per cell of 2 volts and 60 cells will be considered.\nA final voltage of 1.75 per cell or 105 volts for the battery will complete our model.\nDC system loads consist of both continuous and intermittent loads.  Continuous load typically involves\nthe battery 3- to 8-hour ratings.  It consists of indicating lights, relays, and any other equipment\ncontinually drawing current from the dc bus.  Emergency lighting consisting of circuits energized during\nan ac outage plus certain communication circuits involving the 1- to 3-hour rating.\nIntermittent or momentary load, constituting relay and breaker operation, involves the 1-minute battery\nrating.  The duration of breaker operation may be only a few cycles, but the battery voltage drop will be\nessentially the same after 1 minute.  A typical duty cycle will have the breakers tripping at the beginning\nof the cycle and closing at the end of the cycle.  If two or more breakers are to operate simultaneously, the\ntotal current determines the 1-minute rating.\nThe sizing of dc cables and cabinets is done in the same way as for ac services.  The only exception is that\nno demand factor should be applied to connected loads.  Voltage drop should be held to within 3 percent.\nSpecial consideration of short-circuit capacity is not a factor in a dc auxiliary system.\nFigure 15-3 illustrates a typical dc system for substation auxiliary services.\n15.2.5  Equipment\n15.2.5.1  Battery Selection:   Lead batteries are rated in ampere-hour capacity at an 8-hour rate to\n1.75 volts average at 25ºC (77ºF).\nEXAMPLE 15-1:  Battery Selection\nThe model duty cycle could be:\nTen 40-watt, 120-volt lamps - 3 hrs.     3.5 amperes\nRelays and panel indicating lamps - 8 hrs.     5.0 amperes\nCommunications - 3 hrs.      5.0 amperes\nThree simultaneous Breaker Operations - 1  min. 100.0 amperes\nFrom vendor data a cell of seven plates will furnish approximately 200 amperes for 1 minute to 1.75\nfinal volts.

For the 120-volt\nsystem, 60 of the lead calcium cells would be connected in series.  Quite obviously, vendor data is\nnecessary to specify a battery.\n15.2.5.2  Charger Selection:   Satisfactory battery life and service are more depen dent on the design\nand specification of the charging equipment than on any other external factor.  The most costly and\ncomplicated charger is not necessarily the best selection.  Shunt wound dc generators were used for years\nfor charging batteries, but frequent adjustment was required and recharge capability was slow.  For\nsubstation service, bridge rectifiers are used.  Tube type is still in service, but new installa tions are being\nspecified with solid-state devices.\nThe ampere capacity of the charger can be determined using Equation 15-3:\nEquation 15-3\nWhere:\nA=Charge capacity (amperes)\nL =Continuous loa d (amperes)\nC=Discharge (amperes hours)\nH =Recharge time (hours)\nEXAMPLE 15-2:  Charger Selection\nUsing the same model as for battery selection, we have:\nDC Lights     3.5 Amperes-3 hrs. 10.5 AH\nCommunications     5.0 Amperes-3 hrs. 15.0 AH\nBreaker operations 100.0 Amperes-l min.   1.7 AH\nPanel load     5.0 Amperes-8 hrs. 40.0      AH\n67.2 AH\nSubstituting in Equation 15-3 with an 8-hour recharge:\nThe next largest standard size charger should be selected.

If the selected charger uses a cord, cap, and receptacle for ac supply, specify a locking cap\nand receptacle.\nAlso determine if the battery charger is to function as a battery eliminator.  This would allow the battery\nto be disconnected for short periods to allow maintenance on the battery without disrupting 120-volt dc\nservice.  Many of the newer electronic and microprocessor devices require a relatively stable dc supply,\nwith a minimal ac compound associated with the dc supply.  The battery while connected into the dc\nsystem provides this filter.  If the battery is disconnected, the battery charger filtering may be inadequate\nto prevent damage to the relay dc input filters, causing the relays to be damaged.  In such cases where the\nbattery charger is to be used as a battery-eliminator type of charger, compare the ac ripple component\nspecifications on the dc equipment inputs with the ratings for the battery charger.\n15.2.5.3  DC Panels and Wiring:   The substation dc auxiliary system should be an ungrounded\nsystem with fuse or circuit breaker panels for dc service.  The trend is to use circuit breaker panels.\nIt is recommended that the positive and negative legs of the dc system be run in separate PVC conduits\nfrom the battery to the first fusible disconnect.  This reduces the possibility of the positive and negative\nlegs of the battery becoming shorted together with no means of clearing the short circuit.  Also, the\nbattery charger should be specified with a ground detection system so positive or negative grounds are\ndetected.  Figure 15-4 is a simplified diagram of such a method.\nRelay panels having solid-state equipment cannot sustain voltages higher than 140 volts dc without\npossible relay damage.  When the battery is being recharged or equalized, the dc terminal voltage could\nbe in excess of 140 volts.  In this case install a 50 /60 cell switch and do the recharging at the 50 cell\nposition.  Additionally, circuit breaker operation can cause transient voltage spikes that could possibly\ndamage equipment connected to the dc bus.  Install a surge rectifier across the battery to drain the surge\nenergy to ground.  These features are usually not available from battery charger manufacturers, so it is\nrecommended that they be installed in the battery room on a wall-mounted wood panel.  Figure 15-3\nillustrates a simplified diagram of a dc system with these features.  Many utilities will remove one or two\ncells from the battery bank to avoid the problem of overvoltage while the battery is being equalized.\nComplete an evaluation to guarantee the values of current, load, and power supply will stay in specified\nlevels during the process.\n15.3 REFERENCES\nANSI Std.

For small distribution substations, this equipment can usually be contained in\nweatherproof enclosures or control cabinets.  For larger substations, separate equipment housing is\nnecessary.\nA control house provides a weatherproof and, if required, environmentally controlled enclosure for\nsupplemental substation equipment.  Additional space can be provided for workshops, equipment testing\nand repair, storage areas, and lavatory facilities.\nMedium- and low-voltage switchgear can also be contained within control houses, or this equipment may\nbe contained within weatherproof enclosures dedicated to that purpose.  Switchgear is discussed in more\ndetail in Section 5.4.\n16.2 CONTROL HOUSE CONSTRUCTION\nThis section discusses general aspects of the control house construction.  It does not attempt to cover all\ndetails of construction.  RUS 1724E-400, “Guide to Presentation of Building Plans and Specifications,”\npresents details that will apply and should be consulted.\n16.2.1  Foundation\nThe control house foundation typically consists of a spread footing with either masonry blocks or cast-in-\nplace walls.  The footing is designed for an allowable bearing capacity based on soil data.  If soil data is\nnot available, a maximum bearing of 48 kPa (1000 lb/ft2) can be used. The footings are installed below\nfrost depth and in accordance with local building codes and practices.\nDrilled piers are an alternative to spread footings.  Drilled piers are especially applicable for pre-\nengineered metal buildings with structural supporting bases that can rest directly on the piers without\nrequiring a concrete floor slab.  Soil data is necessary for determining the required depth, diameter, and\nreinforcing of the piers.\nDamp-proofing of foundation walls is desirable, especially if concrete block is used.  If a basement level\nis constructed, damp-proofing should be provided.  Footing drains are usually provided when a basement\nlevel is constructed.\nAll foundation walls should be insulated with a 5.1-cm (2-inch) thickness of rigid insulation for energy\nconservation. It is preferable to install the insulation on the inside of the walls, although the outside is\nacceptable.\n16.2.2  Floor\nThe control house floor is typically a floating concrete slab 12.7 to 15.2 cm (5 to 6 inches) thick"

The finished floor\nelevation is usually 10.2 to 20.3 cm (4 to 8 inches) above the finished grade outside the control house.\nThe base beneath the floor slab should be 10.2 cm (4 inches) of compacted sand or gravel, thoroughly\nmixed and compacted sand or gravel, or thoroughly mixed and compacted natural soil.  A 0.15 mm\n(0.006 -inch) thick plastic film vapor barrier should be installed between the floor slab and the base.\nThe method for cable routing in the control house has to be considered before finalization of the floor slab\ndesign.  Cable trenches can be formed into the floor slab, or false floors can be installed providing access\nto large areas below the finished floor.\n16.2.3  Superstructure\nThe control house superstructure should be constructed from fire-resistant, low-maintenance building\nmaterials.  Most control houses presently being designed and constructed are of the pre-engineered metal\nor masonry block type.  Figures 16-1 through 16-3 show examples of some control building\nsuperstructure types.\nFigure 16-1:  Pre-Engineered Metal Control Building (Coffeyville, KS)\nThe pre-engineered metal building is the easiest to procure and erect.  The manufacturer can design and\nfabricate the required building components when given the building size; wind, snow, and ice loads; and\nany special requirements such as additional roof loads for suspended cable trays or other equipment.\nMasonry buildings constructed of block masonry are most economical when masonry module dimensions\nare used to size the building and the building openings."

A sloping roof is recommended for both systems and can be\nobtained by pitching the roof deck or installing tapered roof insulation.  The roof membrane has to be\ncompatible with the slope.  For the slopes of 8.3 cm/m (1 in./ft) and less, built-up pitch and slab is\ncommonly used.  For greater slopes, gravel is used.\nThe control house should be equipped with at least one double door, possibly with a removable transom,\nconveniently located to facilitate equipment entry and removal.  In certain circumstances a second exit\nneeds to be installed in the control house.  The National Electrical Safety Code (NESC)  states:  “If the\nplan of the room or space and the character and arrangement of equipment are such that an accident\nwould be likely to close or make inaccessible a single exit, a second exit shall be provided.”  The\nNational Electrical Code (NEC)  also defines specific requirements for a second exit.  The doors should\ninclude locking devices, astragals to prevent water from entering, and adequate weatherstripping and\nhardware to permit a rapid exit from the control house.\nAdequately ventilate the battery area, either by a natural or powered ventilation system, to limit\naccumulation of hydrogen gas to less than an explosive mixture.  A powered ventilation system needs to\nbe annunciated to indicate ventilation failure.\nProvide portable or stationary water facilities or a neutralizing agent for rinsing eyes and skin in the\nbattery area in addition to proper eye protection and clothing.\nLocate and mark adequate fire-extinguishing equipment in the control house.\nWindows can be provided, if desired, in office and lavatory areas.  Battery rooms and control and\nmetering areas do not need windows.\nConsider adequate methods for building insulation.  These methods include use of insulated wall panels,\nceiling insulation, storm doors, and windows, and weatherstripping around all openings.\nMetal buildings are shop painted and require only minor field touch-up after erection.  Masonry buildings\nmay be left unpainted or may be painted with portland cement or latex paint.  Tint all prime coats to\nmatch the finished coat.\n16.3 CONTROL HOUSE LAYOUT\n16.3.1  Control and Relay Panels\nMost relaying, metering, and control equipment is mounted on fabricated control and relay panels\ninstalled within the control house.  A variety of panel types is available to suit individual requirements.\nFigures 16-4 and 16-5 show examples of various panel layouts.\nSingle vertical panels can be used, particularly for distribution circuits where space requirements are\nminimal. The relaying, metering, and control equipment can all be mounted on one panel, allocating a\nseparate panel for each circuit.  In some instances, two circuits may share the same panel.\nDouble or duplex panels are commonly used for higher voltage circuits, necessitating additional space for\nequipment mounting.  Normally, these panels are arranged in two parallel rows with the panel backs\nfacing each other.  In this configuration, operating, instrumentation, and control equipment for a circuit is\ninstalled on the front of one panel, and the corresponding relaying equipment for the same circuit is"

In some instances, two circuits may share the same\ncontrol and relaying panels.\nSome equipment such as static relaying systems and communications equipment is available mounted in\nracks.  Consequently, separate relay and/or control panels are not required for this equipment.\nModern SCADA and substation automation schemes may require space for installation of a PC with\nmonitor and keyboard, as well as programmable logic controllers and data highway interface modules.\nThis equipment can often be rack-mounted or installed in control panels, as appropriate.\nThe trend is toward more compact equipment arrangements that often reduce overall control house size.\nIndividual three-phase microprocessor relays can replace three single-phase electromechanical relays and\nassociated voltage, current, and power meters, all in one case.  Compact relay and programmable logic\ncontroller designs can be mounted on 48.26-cm (19-inch) racks.\nTo facilitate operation, panels are located in an arrangement that conforms as closely as possible to the\nactual equipment and circuit layout in the substation yard.  To assist in circuit location and operation,\nmimic buses are sometimes used on the control panels, particularly for large complex substations.  The\nmimic buses identify the bus and circuit arrangements.  Mimic buses may be implemented on screens\nviewed from a PC monitor.  When practical, position meters at eye level and switches at a convenient\noperating level.  Locate recording meters for ease of viewing and chart replacement.  Locate relays\nbeginning at the tops of the relay panels and working downward.  Relays with glass covers should not be\nlocated within 12 inches of the floor to avoid inadvertent breaking of the glass.  Locate operating switches\nat convenient heights near the center of the boards.  Require nameplates for all devices.  Provide ample\nspace for relay installation, removal, operation, and testing.\nPanel construction can include removable front plates for device mounting.  Panels may also include\n19-inch rack mounting facilities.  Many of the newer relays and items of accessory equipment are\ndesigned to fit into 19-inch racks.  Cover plates may cover space reserved for future use.  In this way,\nonly a new predrilled plate is required when changing out a device or modifying the configuration.\nCutting, drilling, or covering openings in the panels is eliminated.\nPanel wiring is accomplished on the backs of the panels.  Devices are interconnected and wired to\nterminal blocks, as required, for operation and connection to devices on other panels.  Panels can include\nsmall sections perpendicular to the main section at each end for installation of terminal blocks, fuse\nblocks, or small auxiliary devices.  Cable connections from the equipment in the substation yard can be\nmade directly to terminal blocks mounted on the panels or to strategically placed terminal cabinets.\nInterconnections between the terminal cabinets and the panels can then be made with single conductor\nwire.\nAnchor panels to the floor in such a way as to facilitate relocation to coincide with yard equipment and\ncircuit relocations.\nPanel arrangement in the control house should permit ready accessibility to the backs of the panels.\nSome vendors of pre-engineered buildings can provide completely wired and tested control and relay\npanels and auxiliary ac/dc power systems as part of the building package.  In this case, custom-designed\nrelay and control schematics are submitted to the building vendor.  The building vendor fabricates the\npanels, provides the relays and controls, wires the panels, and tests the complete installation.

Only the external wiring from the building to the outdoor equipment has to be field-\ninstalled.\n16.3.2  DC Equipment\nSubstation dc equipment located in the control house normally consists of the battery, battery charger,\nmonitoring and control devices, and distribution panelboard.  The battery should be located in a separate\nroom where practical.  If the battery cannot be located in a separate room, it should be located so that\nelectrical switching devices and receptacles are not in the immediate vicinity, ventilation is adequate to\nprevent gas accumulation, and live parts are protected from accidental contact.  The battery charger,\nmonitoring and control devices, and distribution panelboard are normally located in the control and relay\nroom to facilitate cable routing and equipment maintenance.\nDetailed design requirements and procedures for the substation dc system can be found in Chapter 15.\n16.3.3  AC Equipment\nA low-voltage ac system is provided in the substation for lighting; convenience outlets; heating,\nventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) equipment; and miscellaneous control functions.\nStrategically locate convenience outlets throughout the control house to provide adequate accessibility.\nProvide the workshop and testing area with a high-capacity ac source and a three-phase source.\nAn ac distribution panelboard located inside the control house is used to supply the indoor lights,\nconvenience outlets, HVAC equipment, and other devices.\nFor greater reliability, two separate sources may be provided for the ac system service.  These sources are\noften fed through a manual or automatic transfer switch so that ac system power can be restored if one\nsource fails.\nChapter 15 contains additional information concerning design of the substation ac system.\n16.3.4  Cableways\nCable routing can be accomplished by using any of several methods.\n16.3.4.1  Cable Trenches:   Cable trenches are formed into the concrete floor slab and are covered with\nmetal plates.  The covers should be flush with the finished floor when in place.  The sizes and locations of\nthe cable trenches are based on the quantities of cables and locations of panels and equipment to be\ninterconnected.  Usually, a cable trench is located adjacent to the backs of the control and relay panels to\nfacilitate panel interconnections.  With duplex panels, it may be desirable to use the entire space between\nthe front and rear panels as cable trench, depending on circuit quantities.\n16.3.4.2  False Floors:   False floors are useful when large open areas are desirable for cable routing.\nLightweight removable floor panels installed on adjustable pedestals are positioned in areas requiring\nextensive cable interconnections or where future plans dictate a large amount of cable rerouting.  The top\nof the removable panels should be flush with the finished floor."

If circuits in one area are damaged, other undamaged circuits in the other parts of the building\nare likely to keep the substation in service.\n16.3.4.3  Conduits:   Conduits can be used for cable routing in floors, along walls, and for cable\nentrance into the control house.\nConduits are available in plastic, aluminum, and steel.  Each of these types may be used in control houses\nfor wire containment to convenience outlets, lighting fixtures, and other control house auxiliary power\nequipment.\nPlastic conduit is easily installed and is available in a variety of sizes.  Take adequate physical and\nthermal precautions when using plastic conduit to ensure safe operation.\nMetallic conduits of aluminum and steel are widely used as control house cableways.  Intermediate- and\nheavy-walled steel conduit provide excellent physical protection.  The installed costs, however, may be\nrelatively high because of the extensive labor required for installation.  The installed cost of rigid\naluminum conduit may be somewhat less than that for steel.  A lower installed cost may be realized by\nusing thin-walled steel conduit (i.e., electrical metallic tubing) since it is less expensive and easier to\ninstall.\n16.3.4.4  Wireways:   Wireways are sheet-metal troughs used for routing groups of power circuits\naround a control house to feed various branch circuits.  Conduit is used between the wireway and the\ndevices.\nWireway offers the advantage of laying rather than pulling the cable into position and the ability to\nchange or reroute circuits easily.  Wireway is available with hinged or removable covers in a variety of\nlengths and sizes.  Select and install wireway in accordance with the National Electrical Code .\n16.3.4.5  Cable Trays:   Cable trays can be used for overhead routing of cables to and between control\nand relay panels. Expanded metal or ladder-type trays provide the best facilities for conductors entering\nand leaving the trays.  An advantage of cable trays is the ability to lay rather than pull in the conductors.\nSuspended cable trays, however, prevent extensive use of this technique because of support locations.  A\nlarge variety of types, sizes, and fittings is available to suit individual requirements.  Cable tray should be\nselected and installed in accordance with the NEC  and NEMA Standards.\n16.3.5  Cable Entrance\nControl and power cables are brought into the control house through windows, sleeves, or cable pits.  The\nwindows are square or rectangular openings, usually through the foundation wall but possibly above\ngrade.  The window openings enable many cables to be pulled without interference.  To protect the cables\nduring pulling, the windows should have smooth surfaces and beveled or rounded edges.  After cable\npulling, split sleeves can be installed around the cables and grouted into place.  Occasionally, the\nwindows are left open to facilitate future cable installation.  Heat loss through these openings should be\nconsidered.  Provide additional windows for installation of future cables.  The windows can be\nconstructed and bricked up to be opened when required.\nCable sleeves can be used above or below grade.  The sleeves are usually cast into place during\nconstruction of the foundation wall or installed during construction of the superstructure.  Pitch the"

Install spare sleeves during initial\nconstruction.\nCable pits may be cast-in-place concrete or masonry openings through the control house foundation to\npermit access to the inside at floor level.  Install a cover over the pit and provide a means to drain water.\n16.3.6  Lighting\nFluorescent lamps are generally used for lighting in control houses.  The trend is toward energy-saving\nlamps and energy-saving electromagnetic or electronic ballasts.  Install lighting to eliminate, as much as\npossible, reflection and glare from meters, relays, and monitoring screens.\nAn emergency dc-operated incandescent system is recommended for most control houses.  This system\ncan be operated in case of failure of the ac system.  It can be operated from battery-pack units or from the\nstation battery system.\nAdditional information concerning control house lighting can be found in Chapter 15.\n16.3.7  Control House HVAC Systems\nTo maintain the functions and accuracy of electrical equipment installed in the control house, HVAC\nsystems may be desirable.\nIn areas requiring heat only, unit electric space heaters are positioned throughout the control house for\nbalanced heating.  If both heating and cooling are required, electric heat pumps can be used.  Several\nsmall units, or one large unit with a duct system for air distribution, can be used.  Supplemental electric\nresistance heating coils may be required for heating in colder areas.\nBaseboard radiation heating units can be used in rooms not reached by the main heating system.  These\nrooms include offices, lavatories, and storage rooms.  The battery room is sometimes left unheated;\nhowever, maintenance of battery temperature close to 32oC (77oF) will prolong the life and capacity of\nmost battery systems.\nTemperature control levels may vary because of several requirements.  Operating ranges of equipment\nhave to be considered as well as economics.  It is recommended that consideration be given to a dual\ncontrol.  Most stations will be unattended and, therefore, a normal personal comfort level is not required.\nHowever, for maintenance reasons, comfort levels are necessary.\nThe system then would normally maintain a minimum level based on equipment requirements with\ncontrols designed so that one or more additional units are used to raise the temperature to a comfort level\nsuitable for maintenance personnel.  In smaller control houses, this may be accomplished during\nmaintenance periods by raising the thermostat controlling a small system.\nIf the control house is to be heated only, it is usually desirable to install power ventilation equipment for\nair circulation.  Size the system for three to five air changes per hour.  Place power-operated,\nthermostatically controlled roof ventilators and manually operated wall louvers to achieve good air\ncirculation.  Position wall louvers so that equipment does not interfere with air circulation.  Provide\nfusible links to close the louvers in case of fire."

Since these terminals are\noften many miles apart, some form of two-way communication channel has to be established between\nthem.  The information to be transferred is relatively simple two-state data in most cases and can utilize\nthe more basic forms of modulation.\n17.2.2  SCADA\nMost utilities have a centralized energy control center from which the electric power system is remotely\noperated.  It is usually expected that circuit breakers and tap changers will be monitored and controlled,\ngeneration monitored and controlled, capacitor banks may be monitored and controlled, alarms reset, and\nmiscellaneous other on/off-type functions effected over distances ranging from a mile or less to hundreds\nof miles."

This data includes\nbreaker status, tap changer position, amps, volts, watts, VARs, and other quantities, both digital and\nanalog.  Again, the data travels over distances ranging from a few miles to several hundred.\nIn most modern energy control centers, the remote data monitoring and system control functions for\nsubstation applications are performed by a SCADA system.  These systems consist of a central host\ncomputer system at the energy control center, referred to as a master station, and RTUs located in the\nsubstations.  There is a trend toward increasing intelligence at the substation level (see Chapter 14,\nSubstation Automation) where the traditional RTU is being replaced with IEDs in a LAN arrangement.\nRegardless of the level of intelligence resident at the substation level, some form of real-time\ncommunication is required between the master station and the RTU or remote electronics.\n17.2.3  Telemetering\nIn some instances where a computer-based SCADA system is not available or justified, it is desirable to\ntransmit discrete power system data from the substation to the energy control system in an analog format.\nFor example, analog quantities such as amps, volts, watts, or VARs may be required to drive a remote\nreadout or chart recorder.  Likewise, discrete system status values such as breaker position may be\nrequired to drive a remote annunciator.  In these cases a communication method is required that can\ndirectly accommodate analog signals that may include scaled milliampere or voltage, or frequency-shift\naudio.\n17.2.4  Voice\nPower system operation and maintenance require the use of voice communication for daily operation and\nfunctioning of the power network.  Voice communications are required between fixed points of operation\nand for mobile maintenance crews.  The transmission of voice signals may take place via cable, radio, or\nthe power system itself.  The transmission facilities may make use of either leased systems or\ncooperative-owned facilities.\n17.3 METHODS\n17.3.1  Power Line Carrier\nPower line carrier, one of the more common communication means found in power systems in the past, is\nnow being displaced in many applications with fiber optics.  But power line carrier may still be used for\nrelaying and voice applications, and lower speed data.\nCarrier signal frequencies range from 30 kHz to 500 kHz and are coupled directly to the power line\nthrough a coupling capacitor, a device that frequently doubles as a relaying and/or metering potential\nsource.  The signals are transmitted at a relatively low power level, 100 watts or less, typically 10 watts,\nand hence do not radiate appreciably from the power line.  They have to be received in a similar way\nthrough a coupling capacitor connected to a carrier receiver at the other end of the line.  See Figure 17-1.\nTo confine the carrier signal as nearly as possible to one line section and to keep the signal from being\neffectively shorted through the high capacitance of the station bus and connected transformers, line traps\nare installed on the station side of the coupling capacitor to block the carrier signal."

This inductance is rated to match the BIL, through current capability and short-\ncircuit withstand capability of any other major equipment on the line, and so is physically large.\n17.3.1.1  Tuning Elements:   Besides the line trap and coupling capacitor, there are several other\ncomponents involved in tuning and matching the transmitter output to the power system.\n17.3.1.1.1  Line Tuner Unit (LTU) :  The coupling capacitor provides the path for the carrier signal to\nreach the power line itself.  Since there are capacitive and inductive elements in the coupling capacitor\nand in the power system, a tuning network has to be provided to match the transmitter output impedance\nto the impedance seen at the coupling capacitor input.  This device, the line tuner, comes in several\ndifferent configurations, depending on the tuning method selected.  In addition, the line tuner assembly\ncontains protective elements such as a gap with capacitor and a grounding switch.  The assembly may be\nmounted in the coupling capacitor base or in a separate weatherproof cabinet.\n17.3.1.1.2  Hybrid :  A hybrid is a special transformer used to combine carrier transmitter and receiver\ninputs and outputs in such a way that transmitters and receivers may be connected to the same line tuner\nwithout mutual interference.  A hybrid has one output and two inputs and is bi-directional so that the\noutput may be connected to the line tuner and the inputs to a combination of transmitters and receivers"

Hybrids may be stacked; that\nis, one of the two inputs may be connected to another hybrid output resulting in three isolated inputs to\nthe same line tuner.  A limitation to this connection is that each hybrid reduces the power level by 3dB.\nThus, two stacked hybrids result in only one quarter of the transmitter power reaching the line tuner from\neach hybrid terminal.\n17.3.1.1.3  L/C Units :  Various combinations of series and parallel connected capacitors and inductors\nare available for use with special tuning schemes or as additional tuning elements in the line tuner\npackage.  In general, the manufacturer’s recommendations should be followed in applying these units.\n17.3.1.2  Tuning Methods:  There are three basic methods of tuning carrier transmitters and receivers\nto the power line.\n17.3.1.2.1  Single-Frequency Resonant Tuning :  A single-frequency resonant-tuned installation utilizes\na combination of inductances and capacitances in the line trap and line tuner resulting in a combination\nfrequency response that exhibits a single sharp peak centered about the selected frequency.  Adjustment is\navailable in both the trap and tuner, but both have to be ordered by specifying a range of frequencies\naccording to the manufacturer’s catalog data.  Single-frequency resonant tuning is used less frequently as\nthe available carrier spectrum becomes more crowded and it becomes more common to have several\nfrequencies for multiple uses on a single line.  Single-frequency tuning results in the lowest transmission\nlosses, but is least flexible from the standpoint of subsequent additional carrier frequencies for control,\ntelemetering, and relaying.  Figure 17-2 shows a typical graph of the frequency response for a single-\nFigure 17-2:  Single-Frequency Resonant Tuning"

The losses are\nsomewhat greater, but the availability of two frequencies can compensate for this small disadvantage.  In\naddition, it is possible to use as many as four frequencies if they are selected so that none is more than the\nmanufacturer’s tolerance away from a peak.  This is done by using hybrids on each of the two\nfrequencies.  Figure 17-3 shows a graph of a typical double-frequency resonant-tuned system.\nFigure 17-3:  Double-Frequency Resonant Tuning\n17.3.1.2.3  Wideband Tuning :  The frequency response of a wideband tuning package is a relatively\nlow peak spanning a wide range of frequencies.  The obvious advantage is that a number of frequencies\nmay be fed through the same line tuner.\nA disadvantage is greater attenuation in the tuning package through more leakage to the bus side and\nhigher impedance in the tuning package.  The wideband line tuner is a simple high-pass filter, and series\nL/C units are frequently used to separate the various transmitter–receiver combinations.  Hybrids should\nstill be used to separate transmitters and receivers.  Wideband tuning is becoming more popular in spite of\nthe increased losses because of the need to put more functions on a line as relaying schemes become more\nelaborate and remote control and data functions are added.  Figure 17-4 shows a graph of a typical\nwideband-tuned system.\n17.3.1.3  Modulation Types\n17.3.1.3.1  On/Off :  This simplest form of putting information on the carrier wave is only used with\ndirectional comparison or phase comparison blocking relaying.  As its name implies, the carrier\ntransmitter is normally de-energized.  When it is keyed, it simply sends an unmodulated carrier that the\nreceiver interprets as a blocking signal.  Voice modulators are usually added so that the transmitter carrier"

Since a received\nsignal in such a relay scheme does not result in a trip or attempted trip, it is perfectly safe to voice\nmodulate the carrier.\nThe chief disadvantage of on/off carrier is its quiescent nature.  The carrier is off most of the time and, if\na component fails during this period, there will be no indication of the failure until the scheme is called on\nto operate.  If it has to block for an external fault at that time, a false trip can occur.  Many utilities avoid\nthis situation by applying a carrier checkback scheme.  This scheme periodically initiates a characteristic\nseries of carrier bursts from one end of the line.  The other end recognizes the test transmission pattern\nand responds similarly.  Receipt of this response at the initiating end verifies the system can transmit and\nreceive data.\n17.3.1.3.2  Frequency Shift Keying (FSK) :  This modulation method finds widespread use in most\nrelaying, control and data transmission schemes.  An unmodulated carrier is sent continuously and is\ntermed the “guard” or “space” signal.  When a trip or data signal is desired, the guard or space signal is\nshifted up or down by a small percentage and the shifted signal is termed the “trip” or “mark” signal.  In\ngeneral, relaying literature uses the trip and guard nomenclature, while mark and space will be found in\nmost data and control literature.  Trip and guard signals are separated by very accurate filters on the\ninputs of the receiver.\nThe advantage of this scheme, particularly for relaying, is the channel monitor capability provided by the\ncontinuous transmission.  If, at any time, the guard signal disappears without an immediate trip signal, the\nchannel is presumed to have failed and an alarm can be energized.  Additional channel security can be\nobtained by biasing the receiver discriminator to the guard side.  A white noise burst, therefore, will\nproduce a small net guard output that can be overcome by a transmitted trip signal even during the noise"

This feature makes it possible to drive an FSK carrier signal through an arcing fault on the\nprotected section.\n17.3.1.3.3  Single Sideband (SSB) :  This modulation type is used extensively in other countries where\nits multi-channel capability is important because of the lack of a reliable and extensive telephone network\nsuch as exists in this country.  In those areas, power systems have to provide their own basic voice\ncommunications, and the power system itself is an excellent medium.  Here, however, SSB carrier has\nfound little use primarily because of its high cost.\nBasically, the carrier signal is modulated with voice or data signals, resulting in the transmission of the\ncarrier plus two sidebands containing the carrier plus the modulation frequency and the carrier minus the\nmodulation frequency, which is conventional.  Since all the desired information is in each sideband, the\ncarrier and either sideband can be eliminated resulting in a suppressed carrier, single-sideband signal\nhaving one-half the bandwidth of a transmission.  It is then possible to transmit two voice channels in the\nbandwidth formerly occupied by one voice channel.\nSophisticated equipment is available whereby, with a system of subcarrier frequencies, many channels in\nmultiples of two can be transmitted.\n17.3.1.4  Power Line Carrier Reference:   The application of power line carrier is a complex subject\nrequiring more space than is available in this bulletin.  For a more thorough review of power line carrier\napplication and design, see the following:\n1. “GE Protection and Controls Relaying Communication Channels Application Guide,”\nGET-8034.\n2. Pulsar Technologies, Inc., “Power Line Carrier Channel & Application Considerations for\nTransmission Line Relaying,” Pulsar Document No. C045-P0597.\n17.3.2  Audio Tone\nAudio tone equipment operates in the frequency range from 1000 Hz to about 3000 Hz.  Frequency shift\nkeying is the only modulation type available; voice modulation cannot be used.\nAudio tone is used primarily as a short-distance medium over wire lines.  FSK modulation provides\nample security, and, in most cases for most telephone applications, reliability is also high.  Additional\nsecurity is available in the form of broadband noise detection and frequency translation detection.\nBroadband noise detection is simply a wideband receiver with no corresponding transmitter.  If this\nreceiver output exceeds a certain level, a noise alarm is actuated and all channels squelched off.\nFrequency translation detection utilizes a single unmodulated channel.  If the output from this receiver\ndrops, the translation alarm is actuated.  This feature is most commonly used with microwave or other\nmulti-channel configurations where a problem in the multiplex equipment can cause frequency shifts.\nAudio tone always requires another communication transmission medium to carry the audio (wire line,\nmicrowave, optical fiber, power line carrier, or shield wire)."

Transmitters and receivers\nare the same as those employed in other carrier and audio tone systems.  However, in this scheme they are\ncoupled to insulated transmission line shield wires.  EHV shield wires are sometimes insulated to reduce\nlosses from induced circulating currents.  The usual insulation level is 15 kV, with gaps on the insulators\nto conduct lightning strokes to ground.\nThe coupling is usually between two such insulated shield wires through a special coupler containing\nmatching networks, capacitors, protective gaps, and an insulating transformer.  This equipment is required\nto protect the communications equipment from the high energy levels present on such shield wires during\nlightning strokes.\nIn general, this method is not used for protective relaying because of the uncertainty of successful\ncommunication during lightning strikes.  It has found more application for data and voice\ncommunications as a low-cost alternative in those cases where the decision to insulate the shield wires\nhad already been made on the basis of inductive loss prevention.\n17.3.4  Microwave\nMicrowave systems have been used extensively on power systems in the past few decades as the\nrequirements for dedicated voice and data communications increase.  Because of the high cost of the RF\nequipment and antenna towers, microwave is generally used where there is a requirement for a large\nnumber of channels between two points.  Transmission is line of sight only, necessitating intermediate\nrepeater stations for long paths.  The cost per channel is relatively low as long as most of the available\nchannels are used and the path length is not excessive.\nMicrowave systems presently employed use transmission frequencies of 960 MHz and higher, which\naccounts for the high channel capacity and line-of-sight transmission.  There is relative freedom from\nmany forms of interference, but path fading and other forms of distortion can be problems.  Most\nmicrowave systems require a license from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to operate.\n17.3.4.1  Analog vs. Digital Microwave:  Both analog and digital microwave systems are in use\ntoday.  Analog microwave systems accept audio input signals that are frequency multiplexed together to\nform an analog baseband signal that is then used to frequency modulate the higher frequency microwave\ncarrier.  Digital signals have to be converted to analog through the use of modems before they can be\ntransmitted on an analog microwave system, which results in an inefficient use of the bandwidth.  Analog\nmicrowave systems are available in capacities from as few as one to as many as 600 channels.\nThe increasing emphasis on data transmission is driving users toward increasing utilization of digital\nmicrowave.  The majority of new microwave systems installed today are digital.  Unlike analog\nmicrowave, digital microwave employs a digital time-division-multiplexed (TDM) baseband that is used\nto digitally modulate the microwave carrier.  Analog (voice or audio) information is converted to a data\nstream using pulse-code modulation (PCM) and then fed into the microwave TDM baseband.  Data\nsignals ranging from low-speed asynchronous (1200 bits per second) to high-speed synchronous\n(56 kilobits/second, 1.5 megabits/second, and higher) can be inserted directly onto the TDM baseband\nwithout any intermediate modulation as would be required in an analog system.  In this way, data is\nhandled much more efficiently than in the analog scheme, and voice is handled equally well.  This results\nin digital microwave systems having a lower per channel cost than analog.  Digital microwave systems"

Figure 17-5 shows a 6 GHZ\ndigital microwave radio and antenna mounted on a substation box structure.\nFigure 17-5 :  6 GHz Microwave Terminal Mounted on Substation Box Structure\nPower utilities typically purchase microwave radios in a monitored “hot-standby” configuration for added\nreliability.  Hot-standby means that each radio contains two transmitters and two receivers, one set for\nprimary and one set for backup, with monitoring and switching circuitry that automatically switches to the\nbackup unit in the event the primary unit fails.  For protective relaying on high-voltage transmission lines,\nit is common to use a microwave system in parallel with power line carrier for maximum security.\n17.3.4.2  Multiple Address Systems:   MAS are specialized microwave radio systems that are\ndesigned specifically for SCADA systems.  MAS operate in the 900 to 960 MHz band and can employ\nanalog or digital modulation technology.  Each MAS provides a single channel of communications that is\nshared among four or more remote sites.  The radio channel essentially behaves like a party line, so only\none site can access the channel at any given time.  Therefore, MAS is best suited to SCADA\ncommunications where a host computer sequentially polls remote terminal units using a master–slave\nprotocol.  This technology is widely used by electric utilities for substation SCADA communications in\ncases where other non-SCADA voice, data, and relaying applications are not needed.  MAS is not suitable\nfor telephone or protective relaying applications.  Figure 17-6 shows a typical MAS installation on a rural\nsubstation control house."

Optical fiber offers the advantages of immunity to electrical sources of interference and\nnoise, and extremely large information-carrying capacity.  (The information-carrying capacity of optical\nfiber is far greater than that required in a typical substation.)\n17.3.5.1  Fiber-Optic Cables:   Fiber-optic cables are available in a variety of configurations including\naerial and underground cables.  Two of the most popular types of cable used by electric utilities are\noptical ground wire (OPGW) and all-dielectric self-supported (ADSS) cables.  In the case of OPGW,\noptical fibers (numbering typically from 6 to 48 fibers) are placed inside a specialized conductor that\nserves as both a fiber-optic communications facility and a ground wire or shield wire.  Since the shield\nwire is typically installed on the top of the transmission line towers above the energized line, ground\nclearance problems that often prevent the installation of a communications cable beneath the energized\nline (i.e., underbuild) are avoided.  Also, for newly constructed lines, the incremental costs of a\nconventional shield wire (a cost that is avoided with OPGW) can be deducted from the costs of the\nOPGW, increasing the economic feasibility of the OPGW installation.  Special suspension and\ntermination hardware is required for the OPGW conductors.  Figure 17-7 shows a typical OPGW splice\nmounted on an A-frame transmission structure.\nADSS cable finds its widest application by electric utilities on low-voltage distribution and\nsubtransmission poles (69 kV or less), but can be also used on high-voltage transmission lines where\nclearances will allow.  ADSS cables are self-supported, requiring no supporting messenger.  The cables\nare all-dielectric (containing no metals) so they can be safely installed in the supply space on electric\nutility poles by properly trained line personnel, and they can be routed directly into an electrical\nsubstation from outside the substation ground mat without introducing a ground potential rise hazard.\nThese cables can contain as few as 4 or as many as 216 fibers and can be manufactured for unsupported\nspans of up to several thousand feet.\nOther cable types that are commonly used include aerial/duct cable (all-dielectric or steel-reinforced) and\nrodent-resistant cables for direct burial.\n17.3.5.2  Fiber-Optic Technology :  Fiber-optic transmission systems are primarily digital, utilizing\nTDM technology as is also used with digital microwave (see Section 17.3.4.1, Analog vs. Digital\nMicrowave).  Optical transceivers are available in capacities ranging from as few as one channel to many\nthousands.  Fiber-optic transmission equipment from some manufacturers has been designed specifically\nfor substation applications, supporting voice, data, and protective relaying functions.  These specialized\nsubstation multiplexers are typically available at capacities of DS1 (1.544 megabits per second or up to 24\nvoice channels), SONET OC-1 (51.84 megabits per second or up to 672 voice channels), and SONET\nOC-3 (155.520 megabits per second or up to 2016 voice channels).  These systems include advanced\nfeatures such as embedded network surveillance, control, and management software, and fault-tolerant\nrings.  Figure 17-8 shows fiber-optic multiplexers installed in a substation for telephone, SCADA, and\npilot-wire relaying applications.\nAnother specialized application for optical fiber in substation communications is GPR isolation of\nmetallic wire communications circuits.  Because GPR can occur in electrical substations during short\ncircuits on the electrical power system, metallic facilities such as telephone lines that enter the substation\nfrom outside the ground grid has to be electrically isolated from the substation ground influence.  Since\noptical fibers do not conduct electricity, fiber-optic entrance links can be used to electrically isolate these\nmetallic circuits in lieu of the more insulating transformers and mutual drainage reactors that have"

Special fiber-optic isolators are commercially available for this\npurpose.\n17.3.6  Wire Lines\nWire lines leased from the telephone company are used in many cases for routine voice and data traffic.\nWire lines entering substations for the purpose of communications, control, and protective relaying\nrequire special attention for high-voltage protection.  These circuits may be used in the event of a power\nsystem fault; therefore, operation during these periods is crucial to personnel safety, equipment damage\nprotection, and service reliability.  The use of high-voltage protection aims to minimize the impact of\nGPR and induced voltages.  Varying methods of protection are being used today.  IEEE Std. 487-1992\nstates, “Readers of this standard should evaluate all alternative procedures, methods, voltage limits, and\nequipment characteristics for their own use.”  Section 6.0, Protection Apparatus, describes broad\ncharacteristics and application techniques of the current equipment in use today.  The most common\nequipment used in wire-line protection ranges from carbon blocks, spark gaps, and gas-filled and solid-\nstate protectors to the more advanced relays, filters, neutralizing transformers and reactors, isolating\ntransformers, and the more recent use of optical couplers.\nSection 8.0 of IEEE Std. 487-1992, Protection Theory and Philosophy, covers the different design and\nphilosophical approaches the telecommunications protection engineer and the power protective relaying\nengineer may take in protecting telecommunications equipment.  Section 8.2 of the standard covers\ndesign requirements for wire-line facilities serving power stations.  Information on many factors is needed\nto properly design a protection scheme.  A few of these conditions are:\n1. Total available single-phase-to-ground fault current and its distribution, maximum GPR (rms),\nX/R ratio, fault-produced longitudinal induction, lightning exposure\n2. Power station ground grid impedance to remote earth and grid area\n3. The extent of the GPR zone of influence\n4. Whether the transmission parameters and service performance objectives are compatible with\nthe available or proposed facilities\n5. Anticipated future changes in any of the above data\n6. Whether lightning protection is required\nUtilizing IEEE Std. 487-1992 is highly recommended for properly designing a protection system scheme.\nThe system designs and protection concepts contained in this standard have been mutually agreed to by\nthe power and telephone industries.\nWire lines entering substation premises have to have special protection against induced currents and rise\nin station ground potential.\n17.3.6.1  Voice and Data Channels:   These circuits may use carbon blocks or similar devices that will\nremove the circuit from service when they operate.\nVoice traffic in most areas can be handled over wire lines since occasional interruptions can be tolerated\nin voice and data transmission.  Relaying can be performed over wire lines only if the responsible\ntelephone company can be relied on to provide circuits that are adequately protected against the effects of\nnearby power system disturbances.\n17.3.6.2  Relaying Channels:   These circuits have to remain in service during and after a power\nsystem fault.

Pilot-wire circuits\nrequire neutralizing transformers whenever dc monitoring is used.\n17.3.7  Satellite Communications\n17.3.7.1  VSAT:   Very small aperture terminals ( VSATs) have been widely and successfully used for\nSCADA master station-to-RTU communications.  VSAT networks optimized for SCADA are offered by\nnetwork providers that sell the fixed transceiver equipment to the end user and then lease satellite airtime\n(space segment) on a monthly basis.  Monthly charges are based on the amount of data that is actually\ntransmitted by each VSAT.  SCADA VSATs are most commonly used by electric utilities and pipeline\ncompanies that have to communicate with RTUs over very large areas where leased telephone line and\nprivate communication network costs are prohibitive.  Electric cooperatives are probably the largest users\nof satellite communications in the electric utility industry today.\nSince the VSAT space segment is leased, and therefore entails recurring monthly costs, VSATs are\ngenerally regarded as an alternative to leased telephone lines.  VSATs do offer certain advantages over\nleased lines, insofar as they are not prone to outage resulting from wind, ice, or lightning.  Since VSATs\nare wireless, they do not require high-voltage isolation as do leased telephone lines entering substations.\nVSATs can experience path outages during extremely heavy rainfall.  VSATs also suffer outages around\nthe spring and fall equinoxes, although these times are predictable and total equinox outage time is\ngenerally only 1 to 2 hours per year.\nVSAT network vendors also offer advanced network management services that are not available for\nleased telephone lines.  Since all signals pass through the vendor’s hub facility, the vendor can carefully\nmonitor channel performance and make maintenance adjustments when necessary.\nEach message transmission between a master station and an RTU has to make two round trips to the\ngeostationary satellite via the vendor’s hub.  Since each round trip requires at least 0.239 seconds to\ncomplete, the space segment delay for a single message is approximately 0.5 seconds.  For this reason,\ninefficient SCADA master station-to-RTU communication protocols can result in the introduction of\nconsiderable communications delays.\nVSATs should only be employed for data applications such as SCADA, and where relatively long time\ndelays can be tolerated.  VSATs are not considered suitable for voice or protective relaying applications.\nIn the early 1990s the Rural Electric Research (RER) Program of the National Rural Electric Cooperative\nAssociation (NRECA) initiated a project with the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) to develop a\ncost-effective Utility Communications Architecture-compliant satellite technology for rural utility\nsubstations.\nThe project was developed by Nova-Net Communications, Inc., now an ICG Wireless Services Company.\nThe results of this project are documented in the final report of Project 91-10, “Bi-Directional Satellite\nCommunications Technology for Rural Utility Substations.”\nFigure 17-9 shows a typical Nova-Net VSAT installation in a rural substation."

Check for minimal gap under the fence or under the gate.  A reasonable rule of thumb would\nbe less than 2 inches under the fence and 4 inches under the gate.\n2. Ensure the fence fabric is intact and there is no rust.\n3. Check that the barbed wire is taut.\n4. Ensure the gate latches are operable.\n5. Ensure flexible braid-type connections are intact.\n6. Verify that no wire fences are tied directly to the substation fence.\n18.3.2  Inspection With Diagnostic Online Test Equipment\nConsider supplementing the visual inspections with the periodic use of diagnostic test equipment that\nallows more detailed inspection of the equipment while it is still energized.  Some of these techniques are\ndescribed below.  Table 18-1, Substation Equipment Inspection Technology Matrix, lists equipment and\nwhat inspection technologies may be of value in identifying the condition of the equipment.\n18.3.2.1  Infrared Thermography:  Infrared thermography can provide a non-contact means of online\nevaluation of “hot spots” in an energized system.  The infrared viewer provides a television-like image of\nthe natural infrared energy being emitted from the objects in its field of view.  The pictures, commonly\nreferred to as thermograms, can be analyzed in real time or stored electronically and analyzed in the office\nor lab.  When a loose or corrosive connection is present under loaded conditions, the infrared viewer can\ndetect the temperature differential between the connection and the surrounding conductors.\nWhen doing infrared scanning, the following test parameters need to be taken into account:\n1. Infrared scanning surveys should be done during periods of maximum possible loading, but\nnot less than 40 percent of rated load of the electrical equipment being inspected.  Refer to\nNFPA 70B, Section 18-16, Infrared Inspection.\n2. Inspect distribution systems with imaging equipment capable of detecting a minimum\ntemperature difference of 1 °C at 30 °C.\nA general outline for a thermographic survey follows."

But when the equipment begins to function abnormally, the rate of gas\nproduction increases.  Analyzing these gases and their rate of production is another valuable tool for\nevaluating the condition of an operating transformer or breaker.  Other tests can also be performed on the\noil to determine the oil’s condition.  For additional information on oil analysis, see Chapter 19 of IEEE\nStd. C57.106, “Guide for Acceptance and Maintenance of Insulating Oil in Equipment.”\n18.3.2.3  Ultrasound:   Another method for evaluating a system that is energized is the use of an\nultrasound detector.  Ultrasound is used to detect inaudible noises on equipment that could indicate\npotential problems.  Listed below are some examples of what ultrasound can be used to detect.\n1. Bus:   When corona is present in medium- and high-voltage circuits, air is ionized.  Corona\nemits a high-frequency pitch that can be heard with the human ear.  However, the ultrasound\ndetector can pinpoint low levels or corona not heard by the human ear and also at greater\ndistances.  Substations and transmission lines can be audibly inspected by this method to\nlocate sources of corona.  The ionized air generated by corona will attack insulation.  The early\ndetection of its presence can allow for corrective measures before further insulation\ndeterioration occurs.\n2. Power Transformers:  Ultrasound can detect inaudible noises on transformer internals that\ncould indicate arcing, sparking, partial discharge, combustible gases, corona, core looseness,\nvibration, or loose parts.\n3. Cooling Pumps and Fan Motors:  Ultrasound can also be used to evaluate the overall\ncondition, and for cavitation and flow."

At the time of failure of a piece of equipment, to be able to determine the specific\nrequirements for repair\nThe types of tests to be performed for each of the above categories vary.  Guidelines are therefore\nincluded to assist in this selection.  The guidelines are, of necessity, quite general in nature and, as such,\nhave to be tailored to meet the requirements of the specific equipment.\nCoordinate the testing schedules with the inspections as detailed in Chapter 18.  In addition, utilize\nscheduled outages to the greatest extent possible as periods for testing since certain equipment is\nunavailable for test unless large portions of the substation are de-energized.\nUpon completion of tests, make provisions to follow-up with repeat tests where required and make repairs\nwhere the need is indicated by the test results.\nIn all cases, factor into the testing procedures outlined specific equipment manufacturer’s recommenda-\ntions as contained in the equipment instruction books.\n19.1.1  Records\nMaintain a records system, as outlined in Chapter 18, Inspection, for each site.  In addition to the details\ncontained therein, these records should contain at least the following information:\na. The name, date, and results of all tests performed\nb. The date when the equipment should again be tested\nc.

Whenever possible, provide temporary barriers to isolate the equipment being tested from\nadjacent energized equipment.\nTesting equipment is usually very specialized.  Restrict its use, therefore, to those personnel who have\nbeen adequately trained.  Improper use of the equipment may expose both the user and the equipment to\nhazards."

The two possibilities are:\n1. Submit an oil sample to a qualified laboratory for determination of the neutralization number,\ninterfacial tension, dielectric strength, gas analysis, and color test.\n2. Perform tests on site where possible, using the following equipment and methods:\na. Neutralization number.  Calculate value by color-indicator titration method, ASTM\nStd. D974.\nb.

In addition, a maintenance program developed\nfor substation equipment should consider site environmental conditions, site location and access, and\npriority of the substation equipment to overall system reliability.\nRefer to manufacturers’ instruction books for all equipment requirements.\n20.1.1  Records\nMaintain a record of inspection and test results that indicate the condition of equipment and the\nmaintenance history, as outlined in Chapter 18, Inspection, in an electronic database.

The following should be considered as minimum requirements:\n20.2.2.1  Equipment and Other Painted Items\na. Thoroughly remove all loose paint, blisters, and scale.  Where the condition of the finish is\npoor remove the paint entirely.  Wire brushing, sand papering, or scraping is desirable where\nonly partial surface cleaning is necessary.  Paint removers will soften and aid in removal.\nHowever, neutralize the paint remover before attempting to paint.  For removal of oil and dirt,\nuse weak solvents such as mineral spirits, other petroleum thinners, or turpentine substitutes.\nb. Paint as soon as possible after cleaning.  Cover all bare metal with a primer.  Where only\nchalking has occurred, one finish coat is sufficient.  Primer and finish paints may be obtained\nfrom most equipment manufacturers and sometimes from local sources.  A zinc chromate\nalkyd resin primer followed by an alkyd base paint is a suitable air-dry combination for\nexterior surfaces.  Allow the primer coat to air-dry thoroughly and follow it with two finish\ncoats with sufficient time allowed between coats for drying.\n20.2.2.2  Galvanized Structures and Fences\nThe protective coating produced by the galvanizing process is normally a long-lived coating; however,\nthe coating will eventually fail and rust will appear.  It has been observed that Class II hot-dipped\ngalvanizing on chain link fences in rural locations will normally furnish adequate protection for many\nyears.  The life of the coating on structural steel used in substations should generally be longer than\n12 years, except possibly for upper flat surfaces of horizontal members.  Any failure of the coating will\nusually occur in spots rather than over an entire surface.  The following procedure is recommended:\na. Clean the surface with a wire brush or by other mechanical means to remove rust and dirt.  If\nthe surface is contaminated with grease or oil, use a solvent to remove those contaminants.\nMineral spirits or a weak solution of trisodium phosphate can be used as the solvent.  A\nsolution of 1 ounce of trisodium phosphate to 1 gallon of warm water is suggested for cleaning\nthe metal.  In the event that it is uneconomical or impractical to remove all rust, a reasonably\nsatisfactory job can be obtained by deactivating the rust through chemical treatment.  A weak\nsolution of phosphoric acid is suggested for deactivating rust.  Use proper skin and eye\nprotection.\nb. Apply a priming coat to the clear dry surface using a good zinc dust–zinc oxide paint.  Allow\nample time for the paint to dry before applying the finish coats.\nc. Apply two finish coats using the same type of paint as was used for priming.  Allow ample\ndrying time between finish coats.  One finish coat is needed for areas on which the galvanized\ncoating remains intact.  The color of the paint is gray, but colors in oil may be added to the\nfinish coats to obtain other shades.  Other paints normally used as final coats for metal (such\nas aluminum paint) may be used as the final coat in place of the zinc dust–zinc oxide paint."

Generally 5 mils\n(0.005  inch) is an adequate thickness.  The thickness should be uniform, and paint should not be easily\nscraped off the metal.  Pay particular attention to welds, edges, and other hard-to-coat areas.\n20.3 UNSCHEDULED MAINTENANCE\nAny abnormal conditions that are noted during any inspection of the substation yard or equipment may\nneed to be corrected as soon as possible, depending on the severity of the condition.  In some cases, the\nequipment has to be removed from service prior to beginning maintenance.  Some abnormal conditions\nand possible corrective measures may include the following:\n1. Loose or Corroded Connections.   Tighten or replace, depending on condition.\n2. Contaminated Bushings.   Clean all exposed surfaces, including casing, porcelain, and oil\ngauges.\n3. Leaking or Damaged Bushings.   Repair or replace.\n4. Deteriorated Insulating Oil.   Recondition or reclaim depending on situation (see IEEE\nStd. C57.106 and Chapter 19 of this bulletin).\n5.

Oil Leaks.  Repair, tighten, weld, etc., as required.\n8. Sludge or Carbon Deposits in Tank.  Remove deposits and clean.  Determine cause for\ndeposit, i.e., deteriorated oil, internal faults, etc.\n9. Damaged Items.  In addition to the items contained in the previous paragraphs, it can be\nanticipated that certain abnormal items will be noted that can only be remedied by replacement\nof the damaged item.  These include:\na. Damaged potheads, high-voltage cable, porcelain (bushings, surge arresters, insulators,\netc.), and other items subject to high electric stress.\nb. Failing capacitors, as evidenced by insulating fluid leaks around bushings or bases, bulging\ntanks, blown fuses on individual units or groups of units, etc.\nNOTE:   It may be necessary to de-magnetize the core in current transformers if they have been subjected\nto very high magnitude currents that have resulted in saturating the core.  Modern high-accuracy current\ntransformers show relatively little change in accuracy as a result of magnetization.  However, should a\ncurrent transformer core become magnetized by surges as a result of opening the primary circuit under\nheavy load or any other means, it may be conveniently demagnetized by several methods.\nOne reliable method requires connection of a variable ac source to the secondary of the current\ntransformer to be demagnitized after the power circuit has been de-energized.  During the test, the\nprimary of the current transformer is left open-circuited.  The secondary winding current is slowly\nincreased from 0 to 5 amperes, and then steadily reduced to 0 again before disconnecting the test source\nfrom the secondary winding.\nIt is important to note that, when demagnetizing high-impedance current transformers, it may require up\nto 450 volts or higher across the secondary terminals.  Appropriate caution is required."

Some utilities are working to proactively address these issues by\nimplementing a condition-based, predictive substation maintenance program using the concepts of\nreliability-centered maintenance.\nReliability is defined as the probability that a system will perform a given function satisfactorily for a\nspecified time under specified operating conditions.\nThe fundamental goals of reliability-centered maintenance are to preserve the function or operation of a\nsystem and to schedule all preventive maintenance tasks.  The system function that has to be preserved in\nsubstations is the delivery of safe, reliable electric power to customers.\nThere are four fundamental principles of pure reliability-centered maintenance theory:\n1. The primary objective of reliability-centered maintenance is to preserve system function.\n2. A good reliability-centered maintenance program should identify specific failure modes to\ndefine loss of function or functional failure.\n3. A reliability-centered maintenance program should prioritize the importance of the failure\nmodes.\n4. A reliability-centered maintenance program should identify effective and applicable\npreventive maintenance tasks.\n20.4.1  Methods\nA reliability-centered maintenance program may be used to identify the appropriate application of the\nfour traditional methods of asset maintenance performed today.  The four methods of equipment\nmaintenance are corrective, preventive, proactive, and predictive.\nCorrective maintenance is a reactive form of maintenance that uses a system failure as a signal to perform\na repair task.  For non-critical components or components that do not permit cost-effective maintenance,\ncorrective maintenance is acceptable.  However, a run-to-failure approach is not acceptable if the system\nfunction is lost or the cost of the maintenance task that would have prevented failure is reasonable relative\nto the cost of the outage.\nPreventive maintenance is a time interval- or usage rate-based maintenance method.  Anthony Smith,\nauthor of Reliability Centered Maintenance , has identified ten common maintenance problems\nencountered in traditional preventive maintenance programs for industry in general that support the need\nfor a better method of performing preventive maintenance:\n1. Insufficient proactive maintenance because most effort is in corrective maintenance (i.e.,\nresponding or reacting to problems)\n2. Frequent problem repetition because there is only time to restore a system to operation and no\ntime or effort spent to determine the cause and repair the root of the problem\n3. Erroneous maintenance work that leads to a plant outage\n4. Proven maintenance practices that are not communicated, taught, or implemented\n5. Unnecessary and conservative preventive maintenance that does not contribute to overall plant\nreliability and contributes to human error"

Maintenance programs that lack good record keeping or a method to track the decision making\nprocess\n8. Use and acceptance of OEM recommendations for maintenance practices that do not apply to\nspecific site conditions and that may be conservative so as to protect the OEM’s warranties\n9. Lack of standard practices among similar facilities\n10. Lack of quality, practical, predictive maintenance tools and procedures\nTwo key questions have to be answered in a traditional preventive maintenance program: (1 )  What tasks\nhave to be performed?  (2 )  When should they be performed?\nReliability-centered maintenance not only asks what preventive maintenance task should be performed\nand when it should be performed, but it answers “why” a preventive maintenance task is needed.\nReliability-centered maintenance uses a process known as age exploration to determine preventive\nmaintenance intervals for components in which there is no determinable age–reliability relationship.  If\nthe regular preventive maintenance interval reveals no signs of degradation or incipient failure, the\ninterval to the next preventive maintenance overhaul or inspection is increased by 10 percent.  If again\nthere are no signs of degradation or incipient failure, the process is repeated, adding 10 percent to the\ninterval each time until the component requires attention or replacement.  The maintenance interval is\nthen reduced by 10 percent and that interval becomes the final task interval.\nReliability-centered maintenance clearly defines and documents reasons for how and why each preventive\nmaintenance task is selected.\nProactive maintenance is the upgrade or redesign of components that consistently fail under normal\ndesign loading criteria or that violate safety codes, regulations, or guidelines.  Proactive maintenance\ntasks typically result from the need to perform corrective maintenance because of system functional\nfailure.\nPredictive maintenance is based on the operating condition of a component.  No component should have\npreventive maintenance performed on it unless its actual condition warrants the task.  Predictive\nmaintenance gives a snapshot in time of the actual operating condition of a component without\ninterrupting the function of the component.  A predictive maintenance approach allows the preventive\nmaintenance task to be scheduled and reduces overall operations and maintenance costs by dramatically\nreducing corrective maintenance tasks.\nOf the four traditional methods of maintenance, the predictive maintenance approach seems to be the\nmost sensible.  The ability to predict system failure and act precludes corrective maintenance.  Knowing\nthe actual operating condition of equipment provides the user the reason why any preventive maintenance\nshould be performed.  Proactive maintenance can be considered as more of a function of engineering\nanalysis due to a consistent failure of a part or component.  As a result, there is a growing number of\npredictive maintenance approaches for substation equipment on the market today.\n20.4.2  Application\nThe best approaches adapt reliability-centered maintenance theory in a practical, understandable manner\nto 1) prioritize assets, 2) assess the condition of the equipment based on known failure modes, and 3)\nidentify and schedule effective preventive maintenance."

The diverse attributes that\ncontribute to this process include:\n• Substation voltage\n• Equipment age\n• The number of sensitive customers directly or indirectly served by the circuits out of the\nsubstation\n• The total number of breaker operations to date\n• The total number of extended outages to date\nMaintenance logs and system operations logs will provide this operational information.  Each parameter\nis weighed according to relative importance as determined by engineering judgment, with a heavy\nemphasis placed on customers served and outage history.  The parameters and weightings can be entered\ninto a spreadsheet to calculate system priorities.  Each parameter will be multiplied by its assigned\nweighting, and all the parameters for each substation will be summed to provide an overall score.\nA sensitivity analysis can be made to vary the weightings as needed.  The spreadsheet can then sort the\nsubstations in ascending order, providing the user with the first substations that deserve a detailed\npredictive assessment.\nAssessing the condition of the parts and components of a high-priority substation starts with a detailed\nassessment of existing maintenance activities.  Interview key personnel from top to bottom of the\nmaintenance organization to discover what maintenance practices are perceived to occur and what\npractices actually occur.  This discovery process helps to define the culture of a maintenance organization\nand identifies the current approach to substation maintenance.  In addition, conduct a thorough review of\nmaintenance records to identify and document specific problem equipment and recent corrective\nmaintenance activity at the selected substation.  The assessment may reveal the lack of information or the\nneed to better manage the information.\nThe next step in the assessment of the parts and components of a high-priority substation is the\nperformance of a Detailed Inspection Procedure and Online Equipment Evaluation.\nThe Detailed Inspection Procedure guides an experienced field inspector through the step-by-step\ninspection of major substation equipment by identifying specific failure modes for equipment that can be\nverified by visual observation or examination of the maintenance records.  Inspect each major electrical\nand structural component of a substation: transformers, breakers, arrestors, circuit switches, disconnect\nswitches, capacitor banks, batteries, relays, switchgear, insulators, terminations, buswork, current and\npotential devices, grounding, support structures, concrete foundations and control trench, control building,\nand site civil conditions.\nThe Detailed Inspection Procedure prompts the inspector to provide a percentage condition adjustment\nfactor based on a recommended condition range for each major substation component.  The percentage\ncondition adjustment rewards or penalizes components based on visible failure modes that can impact the\nfunction of the component or the entire substation.  The percentage condition adjustment is an attempt to\nprioritize preventive maintenance tasks and provide guidance for subsequent inspections on the visible,\nexternal aspects of a substation and is not an attempt to quantify the projected functional life of a\ncomponent.  For additional information on inspection, see Chapter 18, Inspection."

The substation components with\nthe greatest negative percentage condition adjustment (e.g., component function is heavily impacted by\nvisible incipient failure modes) receive the highest priority for scheduled preventive maintenance.\nIn addition, occurrence reports based on the results of the Online Equipment Evaluation prioritize the\nneed for scheduled preventive maintenance on the internal components of substation equipment.  High\ninaudible noise levels, unusual temperature differentials, slow breaker operations, or contaminated oil\nsamples provide good reasons why preventive maintenance should be scheduled.  Lack of any unusual\ncharacteristics in the Online Equipment Evaluation may indicate that there is no reason to perform routine\npreventive maintenance because of the actual operating condition of the equipment.\nRepeat this Detailed Inspection Procedure and the Online Equipment Evaluation process for the second\nhighest priority substation.  Set regular inspection intervals using age exploration.\nAs the concepts of reliability-centered maintenance are implemented for each substation on the system,\nthe user can expect to know why preventive maintenance tasks are performed and can expect to achieve\nthe following results:\n1. Better system availability and reliability\n2. Increased worker safety\n3. Extended equipment life\n4. Improved long-range planning for asset management\n5. More cost-effective preventive maintenance as a result of scheduling men and equipment\n6. Reduced O&M expenses due to reduced corrective maintenance costs\nThe results of a Detailed Inspection Procedure and Online Equipment Evaluation identify the highest\npriority “accidents waiting to happen” so that corrective measures can be immediately scheduled to\nmaintain system function.  As a result, the cost of corrective maintenance in the form of scheduled\npreventive maintenance may initially increase substation maintenance budgets.

Specifically, the function that has to be preserved for electric substations is the delivery of safe,\nreliable electric power to customers.  The concepts of reliability-centered maintenance that have been\nused so effectively in other industries can be applied to electric substations in a viable and effective\nmaintenance approach that proactively addresses the challenges of improving system reliability and\ncontrolling costs in an increasingly competitive energy delivery market.\n20.5 REFERENCES\nIEEE Std.

While it may not always be practical in uprating to attain\nevery desired recommended clearance and spacing, minimums where established in this bulletin or other\napplicable national or local standards have to be met or exceeded.\nModern practice requires that certain environmental and safety issues be addressed in any substation\nuprating or expansion project, even though the existing substation may not have been designed with such\nissues in mind.  Seismic criteria for the area of installation have to be considered.  A suitable oil spill\nprevention plan, possibly including oil containment facilities, has to be implemented.  Fire protection\nmethods (including physical separation, barrier walls, and sprinkler systems) should be weighed against\nthe safety concerns and the costs of fire insurance to arrive at an appropriate design.  Several other\nenvironmental issues should be considered, as applicable:  noise abatement, aesthetics, disposal and\ncontainment of hazardous materials, and containment of electromagnetic fields.\n21.2 FEASIBILITY\nCost is usually a primary factor when determining a course of action:  construction of a new facility\nversus uprating and/or expanding an existing facility.  Prepare construction cost estimates for the schemes\nunder consideration.  Generally choose the plan with the most favorable cost/benefit ratio, provided that\nsuch action is consistent with the near- and long-range system plan.\nWith facility expansion or new construction, include in cost estimates potential impacts due to\nunderground obstructions and environmental concerns.\nConsider substation uprating as an alternative where increased capacity is required and routine expansion\nis hindered due to lack of land area.  During the initial planning of an uprating program, it may become\napparent, after discussions with manufacturers, that such a program is not cost-effective.  In this case,\nexpansion or new construction is usually the most desirable course of action.\n21.3 SUBSTATION UPRATING\nIn uprating substation equipment, the cooperation of the equipment manufacturer is usually required.\nAlthough an agent or distributor for the equipment vendor may initially be contacted, obtain final\ndeterminations from the manufacturer’s headquarters engineering staff as to technical feasibility of the\nuprating, the cost of such work, and where the work can be done—field or manufacturing plant.  It may\nbe necessary for the work to be performed at the manufacturer’s facilities or by its field service personnel\nto obtain proper warranty of the uprated equipment.\nWhen equipment uprating is being considered, only the capacity is increased.  The voltage level remains\nthe same.  Normally the location of incoming or outgoing circuits remains the same although they may be\nreconductored for increased capacity."

Additionally, supply original purchase\ninformation, such as purchase order number and date.  This information will make it possible for the\nmanufacturer to retrieve the original design calculations to determine the possible additional capacity.\nIf the original design was conservative, some addi tional capacity may be possible.  A loading history may\nbe necessary to confirm this.  If the unit is oil insulated, self-cooled, the addition of radiators and fans\nshould provide added capacity.  If the unit is fan-cooled, additional or larger fans or radiators may add to\navailable capacity.  Insulating oil pumping, or additional pumping, may be necessary to further increase\nthe rating.  In some cases, internal leads may require inspection, testing, and even replacement.\nThere are variations between manufacturers but, in general, a 15 to 20 percent increase in MVA capacity\nmay be possible.\n21.3.1.2  Oil Circuit Breaker:   Increasing the MVA capacity of a substation may necessitate\nincreased circuit breaker ratings.  Breakers may be inadequately rated for increased continuous and\nmomentary currents and interrupting duty.  Consequently, determine the fault and continuous current\nrequirements of all associated breakers.\nThe existing oil circuit breakers may be adequate for the increased full load current but inadequate for the\ninterrupting duty to be imposed.\nGive the manufacturer of the breakers complete nameplate and purchase data together with the ultimate\nfull load current and asymmetrical fault current expected from the uprating program.\nFrom this data the feasibility of the program can be determined as far as the breakers are concerned.\nNew contacts and bushings may possibly overcome any full load current deficiency.  Replacement of\ninterrupter units could safely handle the increased interrupting duty.\nApplication of capacitors on a substation bus causes severe capacitive current switching duty.  Compare\nrated capacitive switching current for the existing breakers with the anticipated duty to determine the need\nfor breaker mechanism modifications.  Consult the breaker manufacturer to determine the need for such\nmodifications.\n21.3.1.3  Current Transformer (CT) :  Current transformers should be evaluated for thermal rating\nunder the uprate program by the equipment manufacturer when the apparatus is being assessed.  If\ndetermined inadequate, replacement will be necessary.  Next determine the ratio suitability.  For example,\na 3000/5 multi-ratio CT, being operated on the 1200/5 tap, can be reconnected for 2000/5 service.\nApplication of multi-ratio CTs on lower rated taps results in less accuracy and can lead to saturation of\nthe CTs (with associated error) under heavy fault conditions.  Consider these features in the CT\nevaluation when fault currents are increased.\n21.3.1.4  Wave Trap:   Since a wave trap or line trap is a current-rated device, it is undesirable to\noperate such equipment above the nameplate rating.  In most cases of uprating, wave traps will require\nreplacement."

Current-carrying capacity of the conductors and connections\n2. Fault current capability of the conductor support systems\nAn increase in bus current is directly proportional to the increase in substation MW capacity.  However,\nthe increase in bus heating is proportional to the current squared (I2R).  This heat increase has to be\nconsidered.  Additional heat may, by conduction, affect connected apparatus.  Also, it becomes\nprogressively more difficult to maintain good bolted joints, free from deterioration, as the temperature\nincreases.  For these reasons, good practice generally indicates rating the bus for a 30°C (54°F) rise over a\n40°C (104°F) ambient under full load conditions.  Under emergency conditions consider a 25 percent\nmaximum bus current increase.  These loadings should, however, be limited to a couple of days’ duration.\nFor heat rise computations, the necessary data and mathematical relations are available from conductor\nmanufacturers and industry associations.  An excellent publication of this nature, Aluminum Electrical\nConductor Handbook , is available from The Aluminum Association, 750 Third Avenue, New York, NY\n10017.\nOnce the thermal considerations of the uprated bus have been calculated, decide if the existing conductor\nshould remain or be replaced.  If strain bus, possibly only the drops need changing to a larger size.  If the\nsubstation uprating is a measure to buy time prior to a more extensive program to serve load growth,\npossibly the bus need not be replaced.\nThe fault currents associated with a substation, in the case of rigid bus mounted with apparatus insulators\non structures, cause stress in the insulators and structures.  With the added capacity and consequent\nincrease of the fault current, calculate these stresses be to determine if insulators or structures are\nadequate.  Methods of calculation are described in Chapters 4 and 7.\nThe insulator cantilever strength will most likely be the weak element under the uprated condition.\nSeveral courses are open to remedy this situation.  Insulators of increased cantilever strength can be\ninstalled on the center phase only.  However, it may be necessary to change all insulators to higher\nstrength, depending on the calculated forces.  Additional bus structures to reduce bus span length may be\nan answer, although probably a costly solution.  An alternative solution may be the addition of interphase,\nfiberglass insulators.  Coordination with manufacturers is necessary to find a device that will work\nproperly.  Calculations are needed to verify that the additional weight that would be added to the bus is\nacceptable to the existing design.\n21.3.1.8  Disconnecting Switches:   The increased current of the uprated substation will require that\nthe disconnecting switches be examined for full load rating.  This can be done from the substation records\nor the switch nameplates.  Also check the momentary current capability.  If either the full load or\nmomentary currents are found inadequate, consult the original equipment manufacturer.  It may be"

If\nthis is not possible or the switch vendor no longer manufactures this product, replace the units.\n21.3.1.9  Surge Arresters:   Since the voltage level or substation BIL is not usually increased in the\nuprating program, the surge (lightning) arresters need not be changed.  However, if the existing units are\nof old and outdated design, it is advisable to replace, in particular, those positioned for power transformer\nprotection.  Generally, silicon carbide arresters should be replaced with metal oxide arresters for the\nimproved protection characteristics that are available.\n21.3.1.10  Raceway System:   Essentially, the only changes in the raceway system would be\nprovisions for additional transformer fan and oil pump circuits.  If the system is underground and spare\nraceways or ducts have not been provided, new direct burial plastic conduits can be installed above or\nbeside existing duct banks, thus using the present routing.\n21.3.1.11  Auxiliary Systems:   In an uprating program the essential addition to the auxiliary systems\nwill probably include new ac circuits for transformer fans and oil pumps.  Consider these circuits as\ncritical or essential loads and assign them a 100 percent demand factor.  It is doubtful that the auxiliary\nsystem transformers, panelboards, and service conductors will need increasing in size.  Normally these\nare specified conservatively.  In addition, the operating history of the substation may indicate that the\nexisting loads were assigned a demand factor in excess of the true factor.  However, check the auxiliary\nsystem capacity nevertheless for adequacy.  An additional panelboard may be required to provide for\nadditional circuits.  Consider fault current ratings of equipment downstream of an uprated auxiliary\nsystem transformer.\nThe most important equipment check to make of the ac system in an uprating program is the capacity of\nthe automatic transfer switch.  This switch may have to be replaced with a unit having a larger rating,\nboth full load and momentary.\nIt is unlikely that the battery and charger system will be affected by a substation uprating, but also check\nthese components to verify their adequacy.\n21.3.1.12  Relaying and Metering:   Unless the relaying scheme is being changed concur rently with\nthe substation uprating program, the changes to existing relays will usually consist of revising the\nsettings.  Higher fault current ratings may result in the need for complete re-coordination of feeder and\nbus relaying.  Some current transformers may have to be reconnected or replaced for different ratios both\nfor relaying and metering.  Since there is usually no voltage change in an uprating program, potential\ntransformers and other voltage devices generally can remain the same.\n21.4 SUBSTATION EXPANSION\n21.4.1  General\nSubstation expansion is the addition of transmission, subtransmission, or distribution circuits to existing\nsubstations.  These additional circuits may be required on the primary or secondary side.  In some cases\nmodifications to the switching scheme may be necessary or desirable.  At the same time, capacity may be\nincreased with the installation of an additional transformer(s).  Figure 21-1 shows a substation expansion\nadding 69 kV line, a 69/12 kV transformer, and a 12 kV distribution structure to an existing substation\nconsisting of 69 kV line, a 69/34.5 kV transformer, and a 34.5 kV distribution structure."

The trend is to smaller, not larger, equipment so this risk is reasonable.\nIf future bus extensions are anticipated, it may be advantageous to install disconnect switches on the ends\nof the bus to facilitate the future construction with minimal outages.  With the switches open, future bus\nextensions can be made on the dead side of the switch without de-energizing the existing bus.\nWhen land availability is a concern, gas-insulated substations (GIS) are a compact, though costly,\nsolution to restricted space requirements.

This approach implements a planned program for\nevaluating substation components and making modifications or individual equipment replacements to\nimprove reliability and extend the overall substation life.\nSuch a program can be operated in conjunction with uprating or expansion planning to optimize the\nreplacement and maintenance of substation equipment.  For instance, major substation uprating or\nexpansion planning might include the replacement of existing electromechanical relays with\nmicroprocessor relays for improved substation protection and monitoring.\nReliability analysis is being implemented in many maintenance programs to assess the probability of\nfailures and prioritize modifications based on safety, economics, obsolescence, and power quality.\nMaintenance planning should be a part of the early stages of uprating or expansion projects.  Such\nplanning includes visual inspections, periodic testing, maintaining of spare parts inventories, logging of\nequipment test results, and logging of misoperations and maintenance records."

Provide and maintain proper tools,\npersonnel protective equipment, safety procedures, and safety training.\nA Critical Path Method (CPM) or similar method is recommended for scheduling the actual uprating or\nexpansion activities.  Include the detailed activities of engineering, material specification, procurement,\nmanufacturing, and delivery times together with itemized construction activities.  The construction work\nmay need to be performed in phases to minimize outage time on particular circuits.  Plan required service\noutages to cause the least revenue loss and customer inconvenience.  Factor into the program adequate\ntime to account for contingent delays that can and will occur.  Inform customers of forthcoming service\noutages so they can plan their activities around the outages.\nOnce the program or plan is developed, assign it to a qualified person to monitor the actual activities, both\noffice and field.\nThe program will probably require revision as time passes, but with a detailed plan, future problem areas\ncan be detected and appropriate action taken before they become crisis areas.\n21.6 COMPARISONS—NEW VS. UPRATING OR EXPANSION\nSuccessful substation uprating will require a high degree of technical cooperation between the\ncooperative, the engineer, and the manufacturers’ staff.\nIf uprating is just a stop-gap measure to favor a future program, ask the equipment manufacturer to\nprovide a reasonable life estimate of the uprated equipment.  This will assist in the priority assignment of\nthe future program.\nThese comments apply largely to power transformers and, if history of operation shows a minimum of\noperation above rated temperature, this life estimate can be quite reassuring.\nNew substation construction obviously causes the least distur bance, electrically, to the customers and the\nsystem.  In the case of a small installation, expansion can consist of dupli cating the existing installation\nand making a “hot” cutover or otherwise placing the new section in service with minimum outage.  In this\ncase, if transformers are being paralleled, other chapters in this guide should be consulted for guidelines.\nAn expansion to existing facilities is on a par with uprating as to disturbance, but with good planning and\nmanagement of all phases of the program this can be kept to a minimum.\n21.7 SUBSTATION UPGRADING\nSubstation upgrading by itself is difficult to justify because of the extent and cost of the modifications\nnormally required.  However, when coupled with concurrent substation expansion, upgrading can often\nbecome the best choice compared with con struction of a completely new facil ity.\nSubstation modifications or upgrading are warranted when conditions affecting safety or security are\nevident.  Substations, particularly those of early vintage, may not meet current minimum recommended\nrequirements for insulation, electrical clearances, or structural integrity.  In these instances, make a\nthorough examination to determine the most efficient and economical method to improve the situation.\nConstruction of a new installation with ample provisions for future expansion may be the best choice,\nparticularly if exten sive modifications are required."
