For experienced lenders, the use of an agent gives them the opportunity to reach out to other geographic areas where they might not do business. Use of agents provides the opportunity for inexperienced lenders to develop experience under the tutelage of experienced lenders. One example of use of a lender's agent would be the use of a mortgage broker to underwrite and originate a loan for an approved lender. The loan must be closed in the name of the approved lender, who retains ownership and responsibility for the loan. Lenders can use the experience gained acting as the agent for another lender as evidence of their demonstrated ability for multifamily lending should they wish to become approved in the future.",

The lead lender will execute the Lender Agreement with the Agency and assume full responsibility for compliance with program requirements. The lead lender is responsible for establishing an intercreditor agreement with each participating lender and ensuring that the GRRHP loan is a first lien or a parity lien, if a parity lien is approved by the Agency.
