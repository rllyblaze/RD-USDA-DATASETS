Section 2 deals with processing requirements \nsurrounding condominium ownership, community  land trusts,  and planned unit developments. \nThe chapter concludes with Section 3, which describes the specific processing differences for manufactured homes. \nSECTION  1: CONDITIONAL  COMMITMENTS  [7 CFR 3550.70]  \n9.2 OVERVIEW  OF CONDITIONAL  COMMITMENTS  \nA conditional commitment is a written  assurance  from  the Agency  to a qualified  builder, \ndealer -contractor, or seller that a dwelling to be constructed or rehabilitated will be certified as \nacceptable for purchase by qualified loan applicants, as long as the construction and sales price meet certain conditions. The conditional commitment does not reserve loan funds, nor does it guarantee that an eligible loan applicant will be available to purchase the property. It does, however, provide a reasonable assurance to the builder that the home will be eligible for financing once it is compl eted.  \nIf the area does not remain  rural,  the conditional commitment will not be honored unless \na purchaser is found who applied for a loan before the rural area designation changed. \n9.3 APPLICATION AND FEE  \nBuilders, dealer -contractors, or sellers interested in becoming conditional commitment \ncontractors must apply using Form RD 1944-36, Application for Conditional Commitment. A single application form may be used to request conditional commitments for multiple dwellings. All required attachments mu st be included for each dwelling for which a conditional \ncommitment is requested,  including the proposed selling  price,  address,  evidence of building site \nownership, and detailed descriptions of all proposed construction. \n9-1 \n(01-2 3-03) SPECIAL PN \nRevised (0 5-05-25) PN 640 \nCHAPTER  9: SPECIAL  SITUATIONS  ",
  "page_2": " HB-1-3550  \nParagraph  9.3 Application  and Fee \n \nApplicants must include a standard application fee for each dwelling for which a \nconditional commitment is requested. This fee is updated periodically through an Unnumbered \nLetter (UL) posted to the Agency\u2019s Directives  website. The UL will generally be posted 30 days \nprior to the effective date of the fee change. If a preliminary inspection of the property or investigation of the conditional commitment applicant indicates that a conditional commitment will not be issued, the application fee should be refunded. Once the appraisal is conducted, the application  fee cannot be  refunded. When a loan  on a property with a conditional commitment is \nclosed,  the appraisal  fee collected  from  the purchaser is disbursed to the conditional commitment \ncontractor.  \n \n9.4 EVALUATING  THE  CONDITIONAL  COMMITMENT  APPLICATION \n \nAn application  for a conditional commitment is evaluated  based  on the criteria  discussed  \nbelow.   \n\u2022 Ownership.  The applicant must have an adequate  ownership interest  in the property, \nas described in Paragraph 5.11  of this Handbook, before beginning construction. \n \n\u2022 Capacity. The applicant must have the experience and ability to complete any proposed work  competently  and must be financially  responsible and able to finance or \nobtain financing for any proposed work. The capacity of applicants for conditional commitments should be evaluated in the same manner as for any construction contractor, as discussed in Paragraph 5.25 A\n of this Handbook. \n \n\u2022 Legal capacity. The applicant  must have the legal  capacity  to enter  into the required \nagreements. Legal capacity can be verified by checking the applicant\u2019s business license and registration.  \n \n\u2022 Civil rights. The applicant must agree to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and Executive Orders  relating  to civil rights, as described  in Paragraph \n1.9\n of this Handbook. \n \n\u2022 Affirmative  marketing.  Any company that receives  5 or more  conditional \ncommitments during a 12-month period must develop an acceptable \nAffirmative  Fair Housing Marketing  Plan,  as described  in RD Instruction  1901- E. \n \n\u2022 Site requirements.  The proposed site must meet  the requirements listed  in Section  1 \nof Chapter 5  of this Handbook. \n \n\u2022 Dwelling requirements. If the dwelling is to be constructed or substantially \nrehabilitated,  it must meet  the requirements  listed  in Section  2 of Chapter  5 of this \nChapter . If it is a new  manufactured home, it must meet the requirements of \nParagraph 9.19  of this Chapter. \n \n \n \n9-2 ",
  "page_3": "HB-1-3550  \nParagraph  9.4 Evaluating  the Conditional  Commitment  Application  \n\u2022Environmental Requirements . An environmental review  must be completed  as\ndescribed in Section 3 of Chapter 5.\n\u2022Start  of construction.  Conditional commitments  for new or substantially\nrehabilitated dwellings will not be issued after construction has  started.\n\u2022Local market demand. The number of conditional commitments issued in any\nlocality should not exceed existing market demand. In particular, the number of\noutstanding commitments in the area must not exceed the number of loans that canreasonably be expected to be made within 3 months of dwelling completion. To\ndetermine  this, the Loan  Originator should consider the availability  of loan funds and\nthe number of loan applications typically received in the office.\n\u2022Proposed  price.  The proposed price must not exceed  the applicable area loan limit,\nas described in Paragraph 6.6  of this Handbook.\n9.5 PRELIMINARY APPROVAL  \nIn general,  the Loan  Originator  must review  the application  materials  within  7 days of \nreceiving a completed application. Staff is  encouraged to use online resources, such as the \ncounty assessor or taxing authority, to verify property details provided in the conditional commitment application package.  \nA.Ordering  an Appraisal\nIf the document review indicates that all of the requirements outlined in Paragraph 9.4 \nof this Chapter can reasonably be met (except for the site requirements which will be reviewed upon receipt of an appraisal), an appraisal should be ordered in accordance with the guidelines set forth in Paragraph 5.17 of this Handbook. Because the application  fee cannot be refunded \nafter the appraisal  is conducted, the appraisal should never be ordered until the document \nreview is complete.  \nB.Site Approval and Responsibility  for Environmental Reviews\nUpon receipt  of the appraisal,  the Loan  Originator should ensure that construction has not \nbegun and that the site meets the requirements of Section 1 of Chapter 5. In addition, the Loan Originator will initiate an environmental review as discussed in Section 3 of Chapter 5. Unless there are unresolved environmental issues, the Loan Originator must determine within 7 days of receipt of the appraisal, whether the application for a conditional commitment should be accepted or rejected.  \n9-3 \n(01-2 3-03) SPECIAL PN \nRevised (05-0 5-25) PN 640  ",

Rejecting  the Application  for Conditional  Commitment  \n \nIf any of the requirements outlined in Paragraph 9.4 of this Chapter are not met, the \nLoan Originator must deny the application for a conditional commitment. The documents \nattached to the application  must  be returned  to the applicant,  along with a letter  explaining why \nthe application was not approved. The application, a copy of the supporting documents, and a \ncopy of the rejection letter should be retained in the conditional commitment applicant\u2019s file.  \n \nIf no appraisal  has been  conducted, the letter  should indicate  that the application  fee will \nbe refunded separately. In this case, the Loan Originator should provide the Serving and Asset Management  Office  (Servicing  Office)  with  the information  needed  to send  the refund  check.  If \nthe application was not approved because of the Loan Originator\u2019s assessment of the  \napplicant\u2019s experience or financial capacity, the letter should specify that the applicant has the right to appeal the decision to the National Appeals Division (NAD). \n \n9.6 FINAL  APPROVAL  \n \nThe final decision  about  approving an application  for a conditional  commitment depends \non the results of the appraisal. The proposed selling price listed on the conditional commitment application must not exceed the property\u2019s appraised value or the area loan limit, whichever is \nlower.  \n \nA. Proposed  Price Too High  \n \nIf the proposed selling price exceeds the property\u2019s appraised value, the Loan Originator \nmust  notify the conditional  commitment applicant  that the application  cannot  be approved unless \nthe selling price is reduced. If the conditional commitment applicant decides to reduce the \nproposed price, this decision must be provided to the Loan Originator in writing; the Loan Originator cannot make changes based on verbal instructions. If the conditional commitment applicant elects not to reduce the proposed price, the documents attached to the application should be returned along with a letter explaining why the application was not approved.  \n \nB. Proposed  Price Acceptable \n \nIf all of the eligibility requirements are met and the proposed price is acceptable, a \nconditional commitment can be issued. The Loan Approval Official should complete and sign Form  RD 1944- 11, Conditional  Commitment,  and forward  a copy to the conditional  commitment \napplicant.  \n \n9-4 ",

At the \nconditional commitment contractor\u2019s request, the Loan Approval Official may extend the \ncommitment period for up to an additional 6 months if there have been unexpected delays in \nconstruction caused by such factors as bad weather, materials shortages, or marketing difficulties.  In order  to document the extension, the Loan  Originator should modify Form  RD \n1944- 11, Conditional Commitment.  \n \nA conditional commitment will be canceled  if construction does not begin within  60 days \nafter the commitment is issued, unless the Loan Approval Official determines that there were unavoidable circumstances that justified the delay. The Agency\u2019s construction inspector, or other qualified inspector as set forth in Section 6 of Chapter 5, should visit the site to verify that construction has begun. If the inspector finds that construction has not begun, the Loan Originator should send a letter to the contractor indicating that the conditiona l commitment has \nbeen canceled and specifying the reasons. \n \n9.8 CHANGES  IN PLANS,  SPECIFICATIONS,  OR COMMITMENT  PRICE  \n \nThe Loan Approval Official may approve changes in project plans, specifications, or \ncommitment price if the conditional commitment contractor  requests  the changes  in writing,  and \nthe conditions discussed below have been met. \n \n\u2022 The property  must continue to meet  applicable development  standards after any \nchanges;  \n \n\u2022 If a change is requested  after a loan applicant has exercised  an option on the property, \nthe change may be approved only if the loan applicant and the contractor both agree to the changes in writing; \n \n\u2022 Any increase in costs  must have been  caused  by factors  beyond the control of the \ncommitment holder, such as an unforeseeable materials shortage; \n \n \n \n    \n \n    \n \n \n9-5 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL  PN \nRevised  (04-27-16) PN 485 ",

The revised  commitment should \nbe initialed  and dated by the Loan Approval Official, and initialed by the commitment holder.

Documents  related  to the establishment and operation of community \nland trusts must be reviewed by the Office of the General Counsel (OGC) to determine whether the Agency\u2019s rights are sufficiently protected. Other forms of ownership  will be  referred to OGC \nwhen the Loan Approval Official determines it necessary to ensure the Agency\u2019s rights are protected.  \n \nWhen a duplex, townhome, condex (or other similar descriptive type of property) \nhas shared  property  or zero lot line beyond the dwelling\u2019s footprint and where the borrower \nowns, typically one -half of a 2 -dwelling unit, the Loan Approval Official must review and \napprove the \u201cassociation\u2019s \u201d recorded agreements. The document must indicate the \nmaintenance responsibilities for the structure and any shared walls, roofs, driveways, amenities, utilities, and easements to ensure they are enforceable (as needed) and compel payments from each owner sufficient to ensure that the structure remains in good condition. The document should clearly inform each owner of a unit of their rights, responsibilities, their share of costs , and be legally binding.  A master insurance policy for the building shell \nis required.  If the master policy includes interior property damage coverage (e.g., flooring, cabinets, fixtures) a separate property insurance policy (HO -6 or HO -3) purchased by the \nborrower is not required but is highly rec ommended for protection of their personal \npossessions and furnishings.  \n \n9.13 LOANS  FOR  CONDOMINIUM  UNITS  [7 CFR 3550.71]  \n \nLoans  may be made  to finance  the purchase  of dwellings  in condominium  developments \nif the conditions described in this paragraph are met, and the applicant and the property otherwise meet the requirements outlined in this handbook. \n \nA.
