  "page_22": "HB-2-3560 \n SECTION 2:  OVERVIEW OF THE \nAGENCY\u2019S MULTI -FAMILY HOUSING PROGRAMS  \n1.4   GOALS OF THE RHS MULTI -FAMILY HOUSING PROGRAMS  \nThe purpose of the Multi -Family Housing programs is to provide adequate, affordable, \ndecent, safe, and sanitary rental units for very low -, low -, and moderate -income households in \nrural areas.  In providing this service, the Agency strives to meet several goals.  \n\u2022 Customer service.   The Agency is committed to providing customer -friendly, \nstreamlined service.  The Agency will administer its programs fairly and in \naccordance with both the letter and the spirit of all equal opportunity and fair housing legislation and applicable Execut ive Orders.  \n\u2022 Partnerships.   The Agency\u2019s ability to serve eligible households is enhanced by \nworking with its partners, such as borrowers, property management agents, tenants, other lenders, nonprofit organizations, and state and local agencies.  \n\u2022 Effective use of resources.  As publicly funded initiatives, the Agency\u2019s Multi -\nFamily Housing programs must use tax dollars efficiently.  The Agency aims to minimize administrative costs, underwrite loans responsibly, and leverage funding with private sources of credit to the extent possible. \n1.5   SECTION 515 PROGRAM \u2014OVERVIEW  \nThe Section 515 direct loan program [7 CFR Part 3560]  provides financing to support \nthe development of rental units in rural areas that need housing affordable for very low -, low -, \nand moderate -income households, and where this housing is unlikely to be provided through \nother means.  \nSection 515 loans can be used to build, acquire and rehabilitate, or improve dwellings in \nrural areas.  The term for loans is tied to the expected useful life of the property, and the standard term for an initial Section 515 loan is 30 years with a 50 -year amortization period.  However, the \nterm for subsequent loans and loans for special types of properties, such as manufactured housing, may be made for a shorter term based on the project\u2019s expected useful life.  \nEach loan is made at a note rate established by the Agency as prescribed in \nRD Instruction 440.1.  Borrowers approved for initial and/or subsequent loans receive interest credit that reduces the effective interest rate for the Agency\u2019s financing, thereby lowering the property\u2019s rents.  In return for this below -market  rate financing, the borrower agrees to lease the \nproject\u2019s rental units to income -eligible households at rents approved by the Agency. \n \n \n \n1-5 \n(07-17-24)  PN 619 ",
  "page_23": "HB-2-3560 \n \n   \n 1.6   SECTION 514/516 PROGRAMS \u2014OVERVIEW  \nSection 514/516 direct loan and grant programs provide funds to support the development \nof adequate, affordable housing for farmworkers that is unlikely to be provided through other \nmeans.  \nA.  Section 514 Loans and Section 516 Grants for Off -Farm Housing  \nSection 514 loans and Section 516 grants can be used for the same purposes as \nSection 515 loans to finance rental housing for farmworkers.  Unlike Section 515 projects, Off -Farm Labor Housing projects may be built outside rural areas, as long as the \nprojec t addresses a need for affordable housing for farmworkers.  These projects are \neligible for financing at terms comparable to Section 515 loans, a grant to cover a significant share of the development cost, or a loan/grant combination finance package.  The maximum term for an Off- Farm Labor Housing loan is 33 years, and the effective \ninterest rate is 1  percent.   For Off- Farm Labor Housing grants, the grant period of \nperformance is five (5) years, which starts on the date the agreement is executed by the Agency and the grantee and ends five (5) years from the date the grant agreement is executed by the Agency and the grantee. The grant agreement will remain in effect for as \nlong as there is a need for the housing, as determined by the Agency. Tenants not only must be income eligible, but also receive priority based on the proportion of their income received from farm work.  \nB.  Section 514 Loans for On -Farm Housing  \nSection 514 loans can also be used to finance the development of adequate housing \nfor farmworkers involved in a specific farm operation \u2014On -Farm Labor Housing \nprojects.  These projects are treated as part of the farming operation, and the occupants  do \nnot pay shelter cost (rent and utilities) unless the shelter cost is approved by the Agency. \nLabor housing borrowers who are providing shelter for domestic farm housing that is \nrestricted for use by eligible residents supporting the borrower\u2019s farming operation may choose to provide that housing to residents without imposing charges for rent or ut ilities \nor may choose to impose charges for rent, utilities, or rent and utilities subject to Agency approval.  \n \n1-6 \n  ",

  "page_25": "HB-2-3560 \n \n   \n A.  Nondiscrimination  \nThe various civil rights laws prohibit the denial of loans, grants, services, and benefits \nprovided under the Section 515 and 514/516 programs to any person on the basis of race, \ncolor, national origin, sex, religion, marital status, familial status, age, physical or mental disability or source of income, or because the applicant has, in good faith, exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 U.S.C. 1601).  Discrimination in employment pra ctices is also prohibited.  These same requirements also apply to program \nparticipants.  Agency oversight of borrower compliance with civil rights laws is covered further in Chapters 3, 6, and 9.  Complaints filed by tenants will be  handled by the \nAgency i n accordance with RD Instruction 2000 -GGG and Attachment 1 -A. \nEffective management and consistent \nprocedures are good business practices that help ensure that all applicants are treated fairly.  Poor program implementation, whether or not discrimination is intended, has possible civil rights consequences.  \nB.  Reasonable Accommodations for Persons with Disabilities  \nIn addition to avoiding discrimination, the Agency and loan and grant recipients must \nmake reasonable accommodations to permit persons with disabilities to apply for and benefit from Agency programs.  Reasonable accommodations may include providing modific ations to the dwellings and facilities so that they are physically accessible.  \nReasonable accommodations may also include effective communication and outreach tools so that all applicants can obtain program information (e.g., a Telecommunications Device f or the Deaf [TDD]).  \nC.  Limited English Proficiency [7 CFR 3560.2]  \nBorrowers and grantees must take reasonable steps to ensure that Limited English \nProficiency (LEP) persons receive the language assistance necessary to afford them meaningful access to USDA programs and activities, free of charge.  Failure to ensure that L EP persons can effectively participate in or benefit from Federally -assisted \nprograms and activities may violate the prohibition under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000d.

Adverse decisions must be based upon regulations that are published in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).  For the direct Multi -Family  Housing \nprograms, any adverse decisions must be based upon 7 CFR Part 3560 and not the administrative guidance contained in this handbook. Adverse decisions include: (1) administrative actions taken by Agency officials; and (2) the Agency\u2019s failure to tak e required actions within time frames \nspecified in statutes or regulations  or within a reasonable time if no deadline is specified. \nAppendix 2  contains 7 CFR Part 11, which is the regulation of the National Appeals Division \n(NAD) and provides procedures that both Agency officials and program participants must follow when an appeal is made. Handbook Letter 101 (3560), Standardized Adverse Decision Letter, \nwill be used for all adverse decisions unless another format is prescribed in this handbook.  \nA.  Informing Program Participants of Their Rights  \nWhenever an Agency official makes a decision that will adversely affect a program \nparticipant, the official must inform the participant in writing that an informal review with the person who made the decision may be requested. If the decision is appealable , \nthe participant will also be informed of their rights to seek mediation or Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) and to request a hearing with NAD; Attachment 1 -B is used \nfor this purpose.  If the decision cannot be appealed, participants will be informe d of their \nrights to have NAD review the accuracy of the Agency\u2019s finding that the decision cannot \nbe appealed; Attachment 1 -C is used for this purpose. Mediation or ADR rights are not \nprovided on decisions that cannot be appealed.  \n1-9 \n(07-19-24)  PN 619 ",
  "page_27": "HB-2-3560 \n \n   \n Letters notifying participants of adverse decisions must contain the required \ninformation regarding an informal meeting, mediation or ADR, rights to NAD, and civil \nrights.  RD Instruction 2000- GGG includes only the specific civil rights language that \nmust be contained in any adverse decision letter. Attachments 1 -B through 1- I contain, \nas necessary, the civil rights language and include information on requesting an informal review, mediation or ADR, and rights to a NAD appeal.  The attachments are all title d to \nassist Agency s taff in selecting the correct Attachment for the decision being made. The \nAttachments do not need to be used when an RD Form, Handbook Letter, or other document already includes the appropriate participant rights.  \nB.  Adverse Decisions That Cannot Be Appealed  \nCertain decisions made by the Agency cannot be appealed. In these cases, the \nparticipant is still provided the opportunity for an informal review, however, appeal rights to an NAD and rights to mediation or ADR are not offered. Participants will be informe d \nthrough the use of Attachment 1 -C that they may request an informal review and write \nto NAD for a review of the accuracy of the Agency\u2019s determination that the case cannot be appealed.  Decisions that cannot be appealed include:  \n\u2022 Decisions made by parties outside the Agency, even when these decisions are used as a basis for Agency decisions (such as when an applicant disagrees with a private lender\u2019s decision not to provide credit for a leveraged loan);  \n\u2022 Denials of credit due to lack of funds; and  \n\u2022 Rural area designations.  \nWhen one or more of the reasons for an adverse decision are reasons that cannot be \nappealed, the adverse decision cannot be appealed. In these cases, the letter containing the adverse decision will include only the items that cannot be appealed as the reason why the decision cannot be appealed. If other reasons also exist for the adverse decision, they will be listed separately in the decision letter as other reasons the assistance could not be granted.  \nC.  Informal Review  \nParticipants who want to request an informal review with the person who made the \ndecision must do so within 15 days  of the date of the Agency\u2019s letter notifying the \nparticipant of the adverse decision. The participant must make a request for an informal \nreview in writing, and the request will be retained in the participant\u2019s case file. The informal review can be conduc ted, at the discretion of the Agency by telephone or \nthrough a face -to-face meeting. The informal review can also be conducted by a \nrepresent ative of the person who made the decision. The purpose of the informal review \nis to further explain the Agency\u2019s reasons for the adverse decision, listen to why the participant feels the decision may be incorrect, and obtain any further information from the participant to support their request. The review must be completed within 45 days  of \nthe request, and the participant is notified in writing of the results. The Leadership \n1-10 \n  ",

If the decision is reversed, a letter will be sent to the participant notifying them of the decision and next steps.  \nParticipants may skip an informal review and, if applicable, request mediation, ADR, \nor a NAD appeal. In doing so, participants automatically waive their rights to an informal review.  \nD.  Mediation or ADR  \nAdverse decisions that are appealable to NAD also require that the participant be \ngiven the opportunity to seek mediation or ADR prior to having a hearing with NAD. The purpose of mediation or ADR is to resolve disputes through the use of a neutral mediato r.  \nParticipants may skip mediation or ADR and request a NAD appeal. In doing so, they \nautomatically waive their rights to mediation or ADR.  \n1.  Requests for Mediation or ADR  \nAfter receiving Attachment 1 -B or 1-D, a program participant may request mediation \nor ADR services. Upon receipt of the program participant\u2019s request for mediation or ADR, Attachment 1 -E, 1-G, or 1- H is sent to the participant to start the process.  The \nAttachment used depends upon whether the state in which the action applies is covered by a USDA- sponsored mediation program. These Attachments are generally sent by the \nLeadership Designee since costs are involved; however, they can be sent directly by Agenc y staff at the discretion of the Leadership Designee.  \n2.  Cost of Mediation or ADR  \nThere are generally costs associated with participation in mediation or ADR. When \nthere are costs, they will be shared equally between the Agency and the program \nparticipant, if Agency funds are available. Where Agency funds are not available, the \nAgency w ill participate in mediation or ADR if requested by the program participant; \nhowever, the program participant will be notified in advance of the portion of the cost that the Agency will pay (if any) and their estimated cost for this service. The Leadership  \nDesignee will ensure that all participants requesting mediation or ADR in their state are treated consistently and pay the same percentage of the cost toward this service. The Leadership Designee may also consent to pay a larger percentage (up to 100 percent) of the cost of mediation or ADR for participants with incomes below the poverty level.  The Agency will notify the mediation or ADR sources of how the cost of such service will be paid.

These programs are \nfunded, in part, by USDA and were established primarily to mediate cases originating \nfrom the Farm Service Agency (FSA). If program participants are unsure if a USDA mediation program  exists in their state, they should contact their Leadership Designee. In \nstates with a USDA -sponsored mediation program, program participants who are \nprovided appeal rights generally will be referred to the USDA -sponsored mediation \nprogram. ADR is not applicable in these states. Attachment 1 -E may be sent to the \nprogram participant to acknowledge their request, and Attachment 1 -F may be used to \nrefer the case to the USDA -sponsored mediation program.  In states where alternative \nmediation sources are readily available at a lower cost than the USDA -sponsored \nmediation program , the state will follow the guidance for states without a USDA -\nsponsored mediation program, and include the USDA sponsored mediation program on the list of acceptable providers.  \n4.  Mediation or ADR in States without a USDA -Sponsored Mediation Program  \nIn states without a USDA -sponsored mediation program, Agency officials are \nresponsible for maintaining a list of mediators or ADR providers. The Agency will \ngenerally maintain this list as program participants are referred to the Leadership Designee to initiate mediation or ADR.  FSA can generally provide a list of acceptable mediation or ADR sources in a state. Other contacts include the American Association of Arbitrators (AAA) or State bar association. When making contacts with these sources, the Agency must request the services of a mediator and not an arbitrator.  (A \nmediator resolves disputes by negotiating a resolution through mutual agreement; an arbitrator resolves disputes through hearing both parties and then rendering a binding decision and shoul d not be used.)  The list of mediators will contain the approximate \ncost of each service provider, if known. States may handle the list of mediation and ADR sources as follows:  \n\u2022 The Agency may select a mediator or ADR provider from the list, provided there is \nnot a significant variation in the cost of service providers.  The list will be maintained alphabetically and sources selected in sequential order. Attachment 1 -G may be sent \nto the program participant to acknowledge their request for mediation or ADR, and Attachment 1 -F may be used to refer the case to the provider.  The Agency will need \nto maintain documentation to ensure that mediators and ADR providers receive an equal num ber of referrals.

Timing of mediation or ADR  \nMediation or ADR must be completed within 45 days  after the case is referred to the \nmediation or ADR source, unless the complexity of the case warrants a longer time frame and all parties agree to a specific time frame. A mediator or ADR provider will generally conduct a teleconference between the parties prior to accepting a case to determine if the case can be mediated. The Agency encourages the use of a pre- mediation conference \nsince many adverse decisions in the Multi -Family Housing program may not lend \nthemselves to mediation.  Regardless, the Agency will not refuse to participate in mediation or ADR if requested to do so by the program participant.  \nMediation or ADR occurs prior to having a hearing with NAD. Requests for \nmediation or ADR made prior to filing an appeal with NAD stop the clock on the 30- day \nperiod during which a participant may appeal to NAD. After mediation or ADR has concluded, any days that remain from the 30- day period are available to the participant to \nrequest an appeal to NAD.  Attachment 1 -I is used for this purpose.  The person \ncompleting Attachment 1 -I will need to determine the number of days the participant \ntook to request me diation or ADR. Hearing dates for participants who request mediation \nor ADR after filing an appeal must be selected with 45 days  of the conclusion of \nmediation or ADR. Participants may also request mediation or ADR after filing an appeal with NAD but prior to the hearing.  \nE.  Appeal  \nParticipants who wish to appeal an adverse decision must submit a written request to \nNAD within 30 days  of receiving notice of an adverse decision. The request must be \nsigned by the participant and include: (1) a copy of the adverse decision to be appealed; and (2) a brief statement describing why the participant believes the decision is wrong.  \nUpon receiving a notice from NAD that an appeal has been filed, the Agency will \npromptly provide NAD with a copy of the Agency record, specific references in 7 CFR Part 3560 to support the adverse decision, and any other pertinent information.  A copy will also be provided to the program participant.  \nIn accordance with NAD regulations, the program participant has the right to a face -\nto-face hearing in the participant\u2019s state of residence. The program participant also has \nthe right to request that the hearing be handled by teleconference. An adverse dec ision \nmade by the Agency may result in an appeal hearing and may require a face- to-face \nhearing.  In these cases, the Leadership Designee will determine who will attend the hearing and represent the Agency.  The Leadership Designee  will provide sufficient \ndocumentation and phone resources to the person(s) selected to adequately represent the Agency in the case.  \n1-13 \n(07-19-24)  PN 619 \n ",

It is particularly important for MFH Servicing Officials  to be aware of environmental requirements concerning sites, \nespecially during the liquidation process, when the Agency needs to ensure that it will not acquire property with an environmental liability.  The MFH Servicing Official should also be aware of mitigation measures contained in the Agency\u2019s environmental review.  Where mitigation measures require an on -going effort of owner and management (such as \nmaintaining the condition of a historic building or not building on portions  of the site) \nthese should be a part of servicing.

Under these programs, the Agency provides direct \nloans and grants to support the development of affordable rental housing that ser ves rural areas.  \nThe Section 538 Multi-Family Housing Guarantee program\u2014the Agency\u2019s third Multi- Family \nHousing Program that guarantees loans made by private lenders\u2014is covered in a separate regulation, [7 CFR Part 3565]  and handbook (HB -1-3565) . \nThis chapter also presents the asset management framework that the Agency uses to \noversee borrower performance in meeting their responsibilities under the program.  The framework provides MFH Servicing Officials  with a consistent basis for ensuring that \nborrowers\u2019 operation of projects meets the objectives of the program and complies with applicable program requirements.  \nSection 1 introduces the types of loans and other forms of assistance available through \nthe Section 515 program and the Agency\u2019s objectives in providing this assistance.  Section 2 describes the loans, grants, and other assistance available to increase the supply of affordable housing specifically targeted toward farm labor.  The chapter concludes with Section 3, which outlines the Agency\u2019s asset management framework, as well as the key parties involved.  \nSECTION 1:  SECTION 515 PROGRAM  \n2.2   OVERVIEW  \nThe Section 515 program offers direct loans to eligible borrowers to provide \neconomically designed and constructed housing and related facilities for very low- , low -, and \nmoderate -income households; elderly households; and persons with disabilities living in rural \nareas.  This section of the chapter describes:  \n\u2022 The types of projects allowed; \n\u2022 The types of loans available; \n\u2022 Rental assistance available from the Agency; and  \n\u2022 The Agency\u2019s preference for leveraged projects.  \n2.3   TYPES OF PROJECTS  \nThere are five types of rental projects that can be developed using Section 515 loans: \n\u2022 Family projects;  \n2-1 \n(07-19-24)  PN 619 HB-2-3560  \n ",
  "page_57": "\u2022 Elderly projects;  \n\u2022 Congregate projects;  \n\u2022 Group homes; and  \n\u2022 Rural cooperative housing.  \nThe Agency also services existing mixed projects that contain both family and elderly \nunits. \n The housing must be economical and must not include elaborate features but must be \nadequate to meet tenants\u2019 needs.  The project should be of average quality and cost.  With the \nexception of O ff-Farm Labor Housing, all projects developed must be located in designated \nplaces as described in Chapter 3.  \nA.  Family Projects \nA family housing project is a rental property developed for occupancy by eligible \nvery low-, low-, and moderate-income households.  Nonelderly and elderly households may occupy the housing.  Household income is the only tenant characteristic, except under extraordinary circumstances such as tenant displacement, which is given preference in selecting among eligible applicants for occupancy.  Priority is also given to those needing features of an accessible unit if one becomes available.  Occupancy may not be restricted to particular groups of eligible households and may include elderly \nhouseholds. \nB.  Elderly Projects  \nAn elderly project is a rental property that is developed for occupancy solely by \neligible elderly households, which include a tenant or cotenant who is disabled or age 62 \nyears or older.  Persons with disabilities and their families  are permitted to live in elderly \nhousing. \nC.  Congregate Projects \nCongregate projects are rental properties developed for occupancy by eligible very \nlow-, low- , or moderate-income elderly households, individuals with disabilities and \nfamilies who require some supervision and central services but are otherwise able to care \nfor themselves.  Congregate projects consist of private apartments and central dining facilities in which a number of allowable p reestablished  services are provided to tenants.  \nThese projects are not designed to be nursing homes and, therefore, are not allowed to \npay for the cost of medical- or healthcare -related services.  When leasing units, prior ity \nmay be given to eligible elderly households who qualify for the services provided by the facility.  \n \n2-2 \n HB-2-3560  \n ",
  "page_58": "D.  Group Homes \nA group home is housing that is occupied by eligible very low-, low-, and moderate-\nincome elderly persons or individuals with disabilities who share living space within a \nrental unit and in which a resident assistant may be required. \nE.  Rural Cooperative Housing \nSection 515 loans may be used to finance rural cooperative housing projects operated \nby nonprofit consumer c ooperatives for the benefit of eligible very low -, low-, and \nmoderate -income members, who will own and manage the project. \nF.  Mixed Projects  \nMixed projects are properties developed with a portion of the units designated as \nfamily units and the remainder of the units established as elderly units.  At the time the \nproject is developed, the borrower must designate the units that will be operated a s family \nunits and those that will be operated as elderly units. NOTE:  Rural Development no longer finances mixed projects.  \n2.4   TYPES OF LOANS  \nThe rules governing the origination of Section 515 loans differ slightly, depending upon \nthe type of loan being made.  The types of loans available under Section 515 include: \n\u2022 Initial loans;  \n\u2022 Subsequent loans; and  \n\u2022 Assumed loans.  \nLoans are only made to projects that further the program\u2019s objectives and comply with \napplicable Agency requirements.  \nA.  Initial Loans \nInitial loans are made to projects with no existing Agency loan.  Most initial loans are \nmade to build new properties.  However, the Agency does make initial loans for rehabilitation of existing properties when it is in the Agency\u2019s best interest.  \nThe interest rate for these loans is set at the note rate established in RD  Instruction \n440.1.  The Agency then provides interest credit assistance, which reduces the effective interest rate to 1 percent\n1. Interest credit is only provided for units occupied by eligible \n \n1 Some existing projects do not receive interest credit, while others receive interest credit that reduces the interest \nrate to three percent.

The administration of interest \ncredit is covered in Chapter 7 and also in HB-3-3560. \nThe Agency establishes the term of these loans to correspond to the expected useful \nlife of the property.  The maximum term is 30 years with a 50 -year amortization period.  .  \nB.  Subsequent Loans  \nSubsequent loans can be issued during the term of an Agency loan to help an existing \nborrower pay for repairs or improvements to the property or in conjunction with the transfer of a property where the purchaser is assuming the initial Agency loan.  The ke y \ndifferences between processing requirements for subsequent and initial Section 515 loans are discussed in Chapter 11 of HB-1-3560.  Guidance regarding the requirements and procedures for processing project transfers is covered in the HB -3-3560.  Subsequent \nloans may also be used to finance equity to avert prepayment of the project. \nC.  Assumed Loans  \nSection 515 loans may be assumed in conjunction with the transfer of ownership of \nthe property.  The terms and conditions of the assumption depend upon the needs of the \nproject at the time of the transfer.   \n1.  New Rates and Terms Assumption  \nMost assumptions of Section 515 loans are new rates and terms assumptions\u2014that is, \nthe purchaser assumes responsibility for all or a portion of the remaining debt.  To conserve the Agency\u2019s budgetary resources, the transaction does not involve paying off the old loan and issuing a new initial loan.  Instead, the purchaser assumes the outstanding debt, which is reamortized at new rates and terms.  New rates and terms assumptions are used when the purchaser will experience financial difficulties under the terms of the initial loan or when a change in rates and terms is necessary to facilitate the transfer.  Purchasers may apply for subsequent loans to make up the difference between \nthe amount of debt assumed and the purchase price or to address physical needs at the \nproject.  \n2.  Same Rates and Terms Assumption \nTransfers may also take place in conjunction with a same rates and terms assumption.  \nUnder this type of assumption, the existing note terms, including the interest rate and the remaining repayment period, do not change. \n2.5   PREFERENCE FOR PROJECTS THAT LEVERAGE OTHER FUNDS  \nTo maximize the number of units produced with Section 515 loan funds, the Agency \ngives preference to project applications for new loans that leverage other funds, thereby reducing \n \n \n2-4 \n HB-2-3560  \n ",

Section 514/516 assistance differs from the Section 515 loans in the following ways:  \n\u2022 The objective of the program is to provide housing for farmworkers;  \n\u2022 There are no rural restrictions; and  \n\u2022 Agency grants are available to support the development of these projects.  \nSection 514/516 assistance may be used for Off -Farm Labor Housing projects .  On -Farm Labor \nHousing proje cts may receive only 514 assistance.  They are not eligible for grants (Section \n516).  Section 514 assistance may be used in conjunction with Federal LIHTCs. \nA.  Off- Farm Labor Housing  \nThe Agency is authorized to make loans and grants for financing off- farm labor \nhousing to broad- based nonprofit organizations; nonprofit organizations of farmworkers; \nFederally -recognized Indian tribes, agencies or political subdivisions of state or local \ngovernment; and public agencies (such as local housing authorities).  Section 514 loans can be made to limited partnerships in which the general partner is a nonprofit entity. \nB.  On -Farm Labor Housing  \nOn-farm labor housing is designed to provide adequate housing for farmworkers \ninvolved in a specific farming operation.  Individual farmers, family farm corporations or \npartnerships, or associations of farmers may develop these projects but must operate th em \non a nonprofit basis.  To qualify for occupancy, an individual or a household must simply be employed as part of the farming operation.  There is no income restriction governing occupancy.  However, immediate family members of individuals with an owners hip \ninterest in the farm are prohibited from living in this housing on the property.   \n2.7   LOANS AND GRANTS  \nA.  Farm Labor Housing Loans \nSection 514 loans for Farm Labor Housing projects are very similar to Section 515 \nloans.  However, they differ in two important ways: \n \n  2-5 \n(07-19-24)  PN 619 \n HB-2-3560  \n ",

Today, lending decisions regarding loans for Off- Farm Labor Housing \nprojects are handled through a competitive NOFA process, while loans for On- Farm \nLabor Housing projects are still processed in the order that they are received.  Chapter 12 of HB-1-3560 provides more detailed information about the origination process for Farm \nLabor Housing loans. \nB.  Farm Labor Housing Grants \nSection 516 grants may only be used to support the development of Off- Farm Labor \nHousing projects.  These grants may be used for the same purposes as Section 514 loans \nwhen there is reasonable doubt that the housing would not be provided without the grant.  Chapter 12 of HB-1-3560 provides more information about the origination process for these grants.  \n2.8   PREFERENCE FOR PROJECTS THAT LEVERAGE OTHER FUNDS  \nLike the Section 515 program, the Agency gives preference to applications for Off- Farm \nLabor Housing projects that leverage other sources of funds.  There is no leveraging preference for On -Farm Labor Housing applications. \n2-6 \n  HB-2-3560  \n ",

Rent subsidies under the Rental Assistance Program \nensure that elderly, disabled, and low- income residents of multi-family housing projects financed \nby RHS are able to afford rent payments. With the help of the Rental Assistance Program, a \nqualified applic ant/tenant pays no more than 30 percent of his or her income for housing.  \nResidents of multi -family housing projects built under both the Rural Rental Housing \nProgram (Section 515) and the Farm Labor Housing Program (Section 514) are eligible to apply for the Rental Assistance Program.  Not all residents of RHS -financed housing developments \nreceive rental assistance.  \nThe Agency and the project owner execute a contract in which the Agency commits \npayments on behalf of tenants in a designated number of the units. Both the Agency and the project owner agree to be bound by all applicable Agency regulations. The contract be comes \neffective on the first day of the month in which it is executed (additional units may be covered if funds are available and an additional contract is executed). The agreement may be renewed as many times as funds are made available.

Section 515 \nOwners of Section 515 projects located in areas where prospective applicants are likely to \nbe overburdened by rent or where existing tenants are already overburdened can apply for rental assistance administered by the Agency.  \nB. Section 514/516 \nOff-Farm Labor Housing projects may also apply for rental assistance administered by the \nAgency.  The requirements for obtaining rental assistance are the same as for Section 515 projects.  Operating assistance may be used in lieu of tenant -specific rental  assistance in off -\nfarm labor housing projects financed under Section 514 or Section 516 that serve migrant farm workers .  On -Farm Labor Housing projects are not eligible for rental assistance.  \nSECTION 4:  ASSET MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORK  \n2.11   ASSET MANAGEMENT  \nThe goal of the Agency\u2019s asset management procedures is to ensure that projects \nreceiving Agency financing operate in a manner consistent with the program\u2019s objectives and comply with applicable requirements.

  "page_68": "HB-2-3560 \n \n \n \n3.1 INTRODUCTION  \n \nThis chapter provides an overview of the essential responsibilities for property \nmanagement.  In general, the borrower is responsible for providing management acceptable to \nthe Agency both in terms of staff qualifications and management practices.   The borrower must \nensure that property operations comply with the terms of all loan or grant documents; Agency \nrequirements; and applicable local, State , and Federal laws and ordinances.  For many project \nmanagement responsibilities, the Agency must approve or con cur in the management decisions \nand policies of the borrower.  This chapter is designed to identify those actions that require \nAgency reaction to the borrower\u2019s  decision.  \n \nSection 1 of this chapter deals specifically with property management, including Agency \napproval of the proposed management agent and management certification.  It also describes the Agency\u2019s requirements regarding items that must be addressed in the borrower\u2019s management plan; and civil rights and accessibility requirements, self -evaluations, and transition plans. \n \nSection 2 discusses the requirements for acceptable management entities and the \nAgency\u2019s procedures for reviewing and approving new management entities.  It also outlines the Agency\u2019s procedures for removing unacceptable management entities. \n \nSection 3 describes the program requirements regarding allowable management fees to be \npaid out of project income and Agency procedures for assessing the reasonableness of the  fees.   \n Section 4 addresses the required insurance coverage and real estate taxes for projects.    \n Section 5 discusses the project management requirements and procedures that differ  for \nFarm Labor Housing projects.  \n \nSECTION 1:  PROJECT MANAGEMENT [7 CFR 3560.102]  \n3.2 OVERVIEW OF PROJECT MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITIES  \n \nBorrowers must provide management acceptable to the Agency as a condition of loan or \ngrant approval.  The borrower requirements listed in this chapter may be complied with by the borrower or a person designated in writing by the borrower.  Acceptable management will be \ndocumented in the management plan and management certification.  \n \n3.3 THE MANAGEMENT PLAN [7 CFR 3560.102(b)]  \n \nFor each multi -family housing project, borrowers must develop and maintain a \nmanagement plan that establishes the systems and procedures that will be employed at the project to ensure that project operations comply with Agency requirements.  This plan is used by \nthe Agency to guide its oversight of project operations and its monitoring of project compliance.  \nThe management plan should provide the Agency with information regarding site operations only, not about management agent central office functions.  \n \n3-1 \n \n(07-19-24)  PN 619  \nCHAPTER 3: PROPERTY MANAGEMENT  ",

It remains in effect until such time as the Agency requires modification of the plan, the \nplan needs to be updated to reflect changes occurring in project operations, or the project is transferred from one borrower to another.  \n \nA. New Projects  \n \n1. Requirements for Submitting a Management  Plan  \nFor new projects, borrowers must submit a management plan that addresses the \nrequired items identified in Attachment 3 -A in sufficient detail to enable the Agency to \neffectively monitor project performance.  \n \nIf the Agency determines that a proposed management plan does not adequately \naddress the required items, the MFH Servicing Official will provide written notice to \nthe borrower indicating the deficiencies and specifying a time period for submission of an acceptable plan.  \n No Agency loan will be closed, construction started, or transfer approved before the \nAgency has an acceptable management plan from the borrower. \n \n2. Contents of a Management Plan  \n \nAt a minimum, management plans for multi -family housing projects must address the \nitems presented in Attachment 3 -A. \n \n3. Agency Review of a Proposed Management  Plan  \n \nIn reviewing a proposed management plan, the Agency must ensure that it does not \ncontain policies that violate Agency regulations and that it provides adequate details regarding the items in Attachment 3 -A for the Agency to effectively monitor project \ncompliance with program requirements.  \n \nB. Existing Projects  \n \n1. General Requirements for Maintaining and Modifying a Management  Plan \n \nIn accordance with the requirements of this chapter, the borrower must develop and \nmaintain a management plan acceptable to the Agency.  A borrower\u2019s failure to maintain an acceptable plan is grounds for Agency termination of the management agent.  This management plan will remain the guiding management document, as long as it accurately reflects project operations, and the borrower remains in compliance with Agency rules and regulations. \n \nBorrowers must submit an updated management plan to the Agency if project \noperations change and are no longer consistent with the current management plan on file with the Agency.  The Agency should expect to see a modified management plan when:  \n \n\u2022 Project operations change to meet the needs of a changing tenant  population;  or \n \n \n3-2 ",

Agency Request for and Review of a Modified Management  Plan \n If the Agency determines that project operations are in compliance with Agency \nrequirements; loan or grant agreements; or applicable local, State , and Federal laws but \nare not consistent with the management plan, the Agency will notify the borrower of the discrepancy in writing and indicate that the existing plan is no longer acceptable.  Upon receiving notice that project operations are not consistent with the current management plan, borrowers must take one of the following actions within 60 days from the  date of \nthe Agency\u2019s letter:  \n \n\u2022 Revise the management plan to accurately reflect housing operations; \n\u2022 Take actions to ensure that the management plan is followed;  or \n\u2022 Advise the Agency in writing of the action taken. \n If the borrower submits a modified management plan, the Agency will review the \nplan for the necessary changes and ensure that the plan adequately addresses the requirements of the discrepancy.   The Agency may visit the project or management \nagent\u2019s office to ensure that documented changes have occurred. \n \nC. Three- Year Borrower Certification of Adequacy of  Plan \n \nWhen there have been no changes in a project\u2019s operations, borrowers must submit a \ncertification to the Agency every 3 years stating that the project operations are consistent with the current management plan and that the plan is adequate to ensure project compliance with the loan documents and the applicable requirements of this part (see Attachment 3 -B). \n \nD. Projects with Compliance Violations  \n \n1. Agency Notification to the  Borrower  \n \nIf the Agency determines that there are compliance violations at a project, the \nborrower must respond to the Agency notification and update the management plan in accordance with the requirements below.  If the borrower does not fulfill the \nrequirements of this section, the Agency will deem the management plan for the project unacceptable, and the borrower/agent may be subject to termination of their management agreement.  \n \n3-3 \n \n(07-19-24)  PN 619  ",

The Role of the Management  Agreement  \n \nWhile the management certification replaces the need for the Agency to approve the \nmanagement agreement, it does not eliminate the need for the borrower and the \nmanagement agent to execute a management agreement.  By executing the management \ncertification, the borrower and the agent are assuring Agency staff that an acceptable agreement has been executed.  Agency staff may review this agreement during the supervisory visit.  \nBorrowers operating owner -managed projects are not required to execute a management \nagreement.  \n \nB. Agency Approval of the Management  Certification  \n \nA certification must be submitted for Agency approval prior to the initial approval of \nthe management agent.  Subsequent certifications must be submitted for Agency approval \nwhen any of the following occurs:  \n \n\u2022 An increase in the management fee is requested, if the increased management fee is \nnot in accordance with Attachment  3-F; \n \n\u2022 A new management agent is proposed;  or \n \n\u2022 A management agreement expires,  and a new agreement is executed or  renewed.  \n The borrower must submit a new certification to the Agency for approval at least 45 \ndays prior to the date of the proposed change.

Information related to these compliance issues as they affect Section 514, Section \n515, Section 516, and Section 521 housing may be found in answers to frequently asked questions in Appendix 5 .  In the event that structural changes were necessary, recipients were required to develop \ntransition plans that set forth the steps necessary to complete such  changes.  \n \nBorrowers may become liable for fines and penalties imposed by enforcement agencies, \nloss of tax credits, or legal actions if found in non -compliance with civil rights laws.  The \nAgency does not impose these fines and penalties, but will follow regulatory, supervisory, servicing procedures and loan eligibility requirements when non- compliance is found. \n \nA. Borrowers Required to Conduct Self -Evaluations and Develop Transition  Plans  \n \nThe following borrowers must conduct self -evaluations and develop transition plans:  \n \n\u2022 Borrowers of projects ready for occupancy on or before June 10, 1982. \n \n\u2022 Borrowers of projects ready for occupancy after June 10, 1982, who have been found \nin non- compliance with Civil Rights law (as a remedial action).  \n \n3-6 ",

The Purpose of the Management  Fee \n \nThe purpose of the management fee, which is an allowable expense paid from the \nhousing project\u2019s general operating account, is to compensate the management agent \nfor services provided to the project  when the fee is approved by the Agency as a \nreasonable cost to the housing project and documented on the management certification .  These services are described in Attachment 3 -D. \n \nB. Types of Management  Fees \n \nThere are two major types of fees that, when added together, make up the \noverall management fee for a project:  \n \n\u2022 Base fee per occupied revenue producing unit;  and \n \n\u2022 Add-on fees. \n \nThe base fee per occupied revenue producing unit is the largest component of the management fee.   It must be quoted and calculated as a per -unit, per -month ( PUPM ) fee \nfor revenue producing units occupied during a given month.  This requirement gives the \nagent an incentive to maximize occupancy. \n \nAdd-on fees are quoted as dollar -per-unit amounts because they relate to \nproject conditions that are not a function of project occupancy.  \n \n1. Occupied Unit Fee  \n \nPeriodically, the Agency will review the base per occupied  revenue  unit fee.  \nSurveys may be conducted to collect management fee data from other assisted housing sources such as local Housing and Urban Development field offices, State Housing Finance Agencies, Housing Authorities, local housing organizations, and non- profits.   \nEach Region provides information about the organizations within its s tates, documents \ncontacts and provides a description of the fee structure used by the source organizations.  The d escription should include the amount of the management fee, how the \nmanagement fee was established, and a \u2018bundle of services\u2019 comparability synopsis.  \n To provide consistency, the s tates are divided into Regions.  The Regions are \nidentified as follows:  \n \nMIDWEST :  Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota , Missouri, Nebraska  \nNorth Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Wisconsin;    \nNORTHEAST:   Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire,  \n                          New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia ;  \n   \n3-15 \n(07-19-24)  PN 619  ",

Add-On Fees  \n \nAdd-on fees are a flat PUPM fee paid to agents managing projects with long- term \nproject characteristics and conditions that require additional management effort \nbeyond the activities covered by the base fee portion of the management fee.  The \nadd-on fee is applicable to all revenue producing units regardless of occupancy status.  \nSee Exhibit 3-4 for types of add- on fees.  \n \n\u2022 The Agency has established a standard list of add -on fees that is applicable to all  \nstates.  \n \n\u2022 Exhibit 3 -4 project characteristics or conditions that warrant the use of add -on fees. \n \nAdd-on fees should not cover project characteristics or conditions that are already covered in the base fee. \nAgents may not take add-on fees for management of properties with workout agreements except under limited \ncircumstances, and solely at the Agency\u2019s  discretion.

Examples \ninclude the salary, benefits, and office expenses of onsite office staff and maintenance \nexpenses for the property and costs for processing project -specific transactions (e.g., \ntenant certifications).  A specific breakdown of items that are to be paid from project \nincome as opposed to the management fee can be found in Attachment 3 -E. \n \nThe borrower and management agent must obtain materials, supplies, utilities, and \nservices at a reasonable cost and seek the most advantageous terms for the project.  Generally, expenses charged to project operations, whether for management agent services or other expenses, must be reasonable, typical, necessary and show a clear benefit to the residents of the property.  Services and expenses charged to the property must show value added and be for authorized purposes.

Borrowers without adequate \ninsurance coverage are financially responsible for:  \n \n\u2022 Property  damage;  \n\u2022 Losses due to employee dishonesty or error; and \n\u2022 Personal injuries that occur on the  property.  \n \nBorrowers are responsible for acquiring and maintaining insurance on all dwellings and \nbuildings that are necessary for the operation of the project in accordance with their loan or grant documents.  Insurance must be in place at loan closing and must remain in place until the loan is \npaid in full.   Reevaluation of insurance coverage is necessary when new buildings are \nconstructed, or values increase or decrease materially.  Any refund or rebate from the insurance \ncompany must be credited to the project\u2019s  account. \n \nThe Agency is responsible for counseling the borrower regarding the Agency\u2019s insurance \nrequirements.   Through the Multi -Family Information  System ( MFIS) , MFH Servicing Officials  \nwill monitor insurance policy expiration and ensure borrower compliance.  The Agency will \nobtain insurance for the secured property if the borrower is unable or unwilling to do so.  If a borrower refuses to pay the insurance premium with their own funds or fails to arrange with the agent for subsequent payment by premium note or otherwise, the Agency will pay the amount of the insurance premium and charge the premium payment amount and all costs associated with procurement of the required insurance to the borrower\u2019s Agency account.  The Agency considers a borrower\u2019s failure to maintain adequate insurance coverage or to pay taxes as non -monetary \ndefault.  Borrowers who fail to furnish property and hazard insurance coverage of any kind are responsible for the debt in the event of loss.  \n \n3.10 PROPERTY INSURANCE  \n \nProperty or \u201call -risk\u201d insurance protects the physical asset against loss due to damage.  \nTypes of property insurance are described below. \n \nA. Hazard  Insurance  \n \n1. Loss or Damage Covered  \n \nHazard insurance protects the property against fire and weather -related damage, as \nwell as damage from civil commotion, aircraft, or other vehicles.  These policies may also be known as fire and extended coverage, homeowners, all physical loss, or broad form policies.  \n \n \n \n3-19 \n(07-19-24)  PN 619 ",

If no appraisal report is required, the Agency will perform the necessary \nevaluations and determine and document the minimum insurance coverage requirements in the file.  \n \n3. Deductible  \n \nIf a property\u2019s insurance policy has a deductible, the deductible must be accounted for \nin the reserve account, unless the deductible does not exceed:  \n \n\u2022 $1,000 on any project with an insurable value under $200,000;  or \n\u2022 One-half of 1 percent of the insurable value, up to $10,000 on a project with an \ninsurable value over $200,000. \n  Borrowers who wish to increase the deductible amount must deposit an \nadditional  amount to the reserve account equal to the difference between the \nAgency\u2019s maximum deductible and the requested new deductible. The Borrower will be required to maintain this additional amount so long as the higher deductible is in force.  This is commonly referred to as  GAP insurance.  \n \nB. Flood  Insurance \n \n1. Loss or Damage Covered  \n \nFlood insurance protects the property against flooding caused by natural disasters \nsuch as hurricanes.

Coverage Requirements  \n \nFlood insurance is required for any property located in a Special Flood Hazard Area \n(SFHA), as identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).  FEMA Form 81- 93, Standard Flood Hazard Determination is used to determine if a property is \nin a SFHA and whether flood insurance is available under FEMA\u2019s National Flood Insurance Program.  If the property is in a SFHA, the Agency will notify the borrower using Form RD 3550- 6, Notice of Special Flood Hazards, Flood Insurance Purchase \nRequirements, and Availability of Federal Disaster Relief Assistance.  The borrower must sign and return Form RD 3550- 6 prior to loan closing.  If the borrower cannot \nsecure flood insurance through FEMA\u2019s National Flood Insurance Program in a SFHA, the property is not eligible for Federal financial assistance.  \n \n3.

If there are insurable buildings located on the property, \nthe policy\u2019s effective date will be on or before loan closing or assumption, or before the credit sale is closed, so that the policy will properly insure the borrower and the mortgagees.  When new buildings are erected or major improvements made to \nexisting buildings, such insurance will be made effective as of the date materials are delivered to the property.

If the policy is the type that imposes an \nassessment only after a loss has occurred, the borrower must provide documentation from the insurance company that no assessment is owed.  If the insurance policy is automatically renewable, the renewal clause must meet Agency  requirements.  \n \n\u2022 Loss payee.   The Agency must be named loss co -payee on all properties where it \nholds first lien position, which means if there is a damage or loss, the insurance draft will be made payable to the Agency.

Loss or Damage Covered  \n \nThis coverage insures against any personal injury that might occur in or on the \nproject\u2019s common areas, common elements, commercial space, and public areas.  \n \nB. Coverage Requirements \n \nThe coverage must meet the requirements established below.  \n \n1. Commercial General  Liability  \n \nThe insurer's limit of liability per occurrence for personal injury, bodily injury, or \nproperty damage under the terms of coverage must be at least $1,000,000.  Coverage may also include borrower exposure to risks such as E&O and environmental damage, or protection against discrimination claims.  \n \n2. Umbrella Liability Insurance \n \nThe Agency recommends, but does not require, the borrower to obtain umbrella \nliability insurance to provide coverage over and above the $1,000,000 provided for in the commercial general liability policy.   The Agency recommends that umbrella liability \ninsurance policies provide coverage as follows:  \n \n  \n \n3-26 HB-2-3560  \n ",

The insurance provider must be licensed or authorized to do business in the State or jurisdiction where the project is located.  In making the determination that an insurance \ncompany is reputable and financially sound, the Agency uses all relevant available information, including financial statements, Best\u2019s Insurance Reports, and information from State insurance \nauthorities.  \n \nThe borrower and management agent are required to disclose any IOI relationships with \nthe insurance company.  \n \n3.18 BORROWER FAILURE TO MEET INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS  \n \nThe MFH Servicing Official is responsible for taking all actions in connection with \ninsurance that are necessary to protect the security interest of the Agency.  Any unusual \nsituation that may arise with respect to borrower procuring or maintaining insurance should be referred to the Leadership Designee.  The Leadership Designee may refer questions to the \nOffice of General Counsel (OGC).  \n \nA. Unacceptable Insurance Policy  \n \nWhen the borrower submits a policy or binder that does not meet Agency \nrequirements, Agency s taff will return the policy/binder to the borrower with a letter \nthat provides the reasons for the policy's unacceptability and requires an acceptable policy within 30 days of the date of the  letter . \n \nIf acceptable coverage still is not obtained from an authorized provider and the \ndetermination has been made to continue with the borrower, the MFH Servicing Official will temporarily accept from the borrower the available insurance policy the Agency determines most nearly conforms to established requirements.  Whenever adequate \ninsurance becomes available, the Leadership Designee  will require the borrower to \ndeliver to the Agency an acceptable insurance policy.  \n \nB. Expired  Policies  \n \nWhen an expired insurance policy is not renewed, the MFH Servicing Official will \nrequire the borrower to provide a new policy.  The Agency will be shown in the loss payable clause and in the mortgage clause in the proper order of priority.  Insurance \ncoverage on each building usually will be the same as shown on the expired policy if it meets or exceeds Agency requirements.  If the coverage shown on the expired policy does not meet Agency requirements, the borrower will obtain the proper coverage.  If \nthe insurance agency or broker who issued the expired policy refuses to issue a new \npolicy, the MFH Servicing Official will have the borrower designate in writing another \ninsurance agency or broker from whom the insurance can be obtained.  \n \n3-28 ",

For off -farm labor housing operated on \na seasonal basis, the management plan must establish specific opening and closing dates.  \n \nB. On-Farm Labor Housing  \n \nProject management for On -Farm Labor Housing projects should follow the same \nbasic procedures as outlined in this chapter for the Section 515 program with the following exceptions:  \n \n\u2022 On-Farm Labor Housing borrowers are expected to manage their own properties and \nshould not need to charge a fee for this service; and \n \n\u2022 On-Farm Labor Housing borrowers are required to maintain a lease or employment \ncontract with each tenant specifying employment with the borrower as a condition for continued occupancy.  \n \n3.22 INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS  \n \nA.

  "page_99": "HB-2-3560   \n \n3.23 SPECIAL SERVICING REQUIREMENTS FOR SECTION 514 ON- FARM \nLABOR  HOUSING  \n \nA. Background.  \n \nPrior to January 17, 1993, owners of on- farm type LH were not allowed to charge rent or \nutilities to eligible tenants residing in the housing if the requirement that the owner execute a \nloan agreement had been waived.   If there had been no waiver of the loan agreement \nrequirement, owners of on -farm type LH were allowed to charge rent and utilities for the unit.  \n \nEffective January 17, 1993, regulations required all owners of Section 514 on- farm type \nLH to sign a loan agreement.  By signing this agreement, the owners of on- farm LH reaffirmed \ntheir obligation not to charge rent or utilities to eligible tenants.  Owners who sign the \nagreement must obtain the Government\u2019s prior  approval for charging rent, utilities, refundable \ndeposit charges or cleaning fees.  Charges must be reasonable and approved in accordance with the procedure.  Borrowers not meeting these require ments will be requested to comply with \nthese requirements.  Borrowers unwilling or unable to do so may be subject to the RHS initiating appropriate servicing action to seek compliance.  \n \nB. Policy.  \n \nAgency staff  are to ensure that owners of on- farm type LH financed under Section 514 \nare not charging for rent, utilities, refundable damage deposit charges, or cleaning fees to residents, unless the rent, charges, and fees are approved by authorized officials.  \n \nWhere violations are evident, the owner will be asked, in writing, to come into compliance.  \nTenants must receive proper notification and an opportunity to comment on proposed rent changes.  Borrowers should arrange to request rent changes during periods when migrant residents can be readily contacted.  Making requests during the off -farm  season when tenants \nare not occupying the units does not excuse the borrower from the responsibility to make effective notification to tenants.  Tenants must also receive notice of any approved charges authorized by the Agency prior to imposing charges.  Borrowers imposing unauthorized charges must be notified, in writing by the Agency, that they must roll bac k rates retroactively to the last \nauthorized level.  The borrower must give tenants a rebate or credit for the unauthorized charges.  \n \nBorrowers with known violations must be brought into compliance or subjected to \nservicing actions which may include, but not be limited to, added Agency supervisory visits, inspections, and reviews; acceleration; suspension; debarment; and referral to loca l, State , or \nFederal officials for investigation and prosecution of violations of civil or criminal law.  \n \nC. Definition of Rent . \n \nFor administering the section 514 on- farm program, the term \u201crent\u201d means any charge \nmade by a landlord to an eligible tenant household for the use and occupancy of the housing and includes utilities (i.e., electricity, heat, water, waste disposal, etc.) or  the requirement that the \ntenant pay the utilities directly to the utility provider.  \n \nThe term \u201crent\u201d is also clarified to include any deductions or off -sets made to a tenant\u2019s wages \nfor the use of a LH dwelling.  Rent does not include bona -fide wage changes or reductions \nunrelated to retaining rent- free housing benefits.  Agency officials should seek to obtain and \ndocument the following:  \n \n3-32 ",
  "page_100": " \nHB-2-3560 \n \n \n \n\u2022 A meeting with the tenants residing in the labor housing should be convened, \npreferably without the borrower being in attendance in order to ensure objectivity.  \nSolicit the information set out in the Supervisory Visit On -Farm form in MFIS.  \nLetters to tenants in advance of the visit may also be used to solicit this  information.  \n \n\u2022 If the borrower is unable to provide utility bills, contacting the utility company to determine in whose name the utilities are registered.  Compare the information solicited by tenant interviews on utilities paid with the utility company data, where possible.  \n \n\u2022 A review of the borrower\u2019s farm and home plan and other financial records to \ndetermine whether the borrower is deriving any income from the farm labor housing \nunits.

Servicing  Actions.  \n \n Normal servicing letter and initial follow -up:  If the borrower is not complying with \nAgency regulations (including improperly charging rent, permitting unlicensed occupancy or occupancy during a period for which the housing was not designed) the borrower should be sent the first servicing letter identi fying the compliance deficiencies.  The letter should normally be \nsent within 15 days of identification of the compliance deficiencies.  Borrowers should normally be requested to issue a response within 15 days of the date of such a letter.  When rent chan ge \nviolations are identified, the extent of the violations should be documented, including an estimate of the amount of the improper charges involved and the documentation relied upon to derive these estimates.   Borrowers in violation should be requested to show evidence of any \nreimbursement or crediting of improper charges to those residents affected.  This includes documentation of attempts to contact and reimburse former tenants for unauthorized charges.  Where documentation shows former tenants cannot be reached for reimbursement of unauthorized charges, the borrower may remit the unauthorized charges to the Government for processing as a miscellaneous payment for crediting to the Rural Housing Insurance  Fund. \n \nWithin 30 days of sending any letter to the borrower citing unapproved rent charges, officials should verify whether the borrower has stopped unapproved charging for the use and occupancy of the housing, and if the borrower has refunded tenants any imprope r charges previously \ncollected.  This may be accomplished by a follow -up visit, written communication to tenants, or \nother effective means.  During any follow - up visit, RHS staff should attempt to meet with the \ntenants to determine if a borrower\u2019s imprope r practice of charging for the use of the housing has \nceased.  The meeting between RHS staff and the tenants should not  be in the presence of the \nborrower.  \n \n Workout plan to achieve compliance :  When a workout plan is being considered to bring a \nborrower into compliance with Agency regulations.  Borrowers that are not in compliance may be eligible for a supplementary payment agreement calling for less than a full loan installment for use in refunding improper charges to residents or former residents.   Upon the end of such \nworkout arrangements, including deferred or reduced debt service payments, reamortization of the account should be  considered.  \n \n3-33 \n(07-19-24)  PN 619 ",
  "page_101": " \n \n \n \nUpon compliance with the rent change approval by Agency servicing officials, the borrower \nmay consider waiving the authorized collections and credit residents for payment of the approved charges until such time as the improperly assessed charges are fully offset.  Such arrangements should normally not exceed two years.  Borrowers may not reduce resident wages to finance any reductions in shelter cost charges.  \n \nIf the housing is not suitable for year -round occupancy, a rent charge approved by RHS may \nonly be assessed for the period of occupancy for which the housing is suitable.  The housing may not be occupied, and no rent may be charged for the period for which the housing is not suitable for occupancy.  If the borrower wishes to make the housing suitable for year-round \noccupancy, RHS may approve any rent change request for the entire year only after the borrower makes the necessary modifications and obtains all  necessary permits and licenses to operate the \nhousing on a year- round basis.  \n \n Secondary request letters:   borrowers failing to respond to letters requesting compliance \nwith Agency regulations or failing to arrange a meeting to resolve compliance concerns, or failing to arrange to develop an acceptable workout plan, must be notified of the Agency\u2019s continued concerns and requested to comply.  Borrowers will be advised that the servicing \noptions available to resolve compliance concerns.  \n \n Last notice to avoid more serious servicing actions:   borrowers who continue to be in non-\ncompliance will be requested to comply with Agency regulations and requirements or face the prospects of adverse servicing actions.  The timeframe for reply to such a letter should normally be within 15 days of the date of such letter.   The MFH Servicing Official will forward a problem \ncase report for borrowers in violation of Agency requirements to the Leadership Designee along with recommended servicing actions.  The time frame for this action should normally be within 30 days of concluding that efforts to achieve compliance have been unsuccessful.  \n \n Processing problem case reports:   the Leadership Designee should take appropriate action \non problem case reports and request any needed guidance or action from other Governmental officials when warranted.  This may include seeking to initiate foreclosure, seeking appointment of a receiver, or to initiate other appropriate legal remedies to enforce compliance.  This may also include initiating a request for an audit or investigation from the Office of Inspector General (OIG) in accordance with the provision s of 7 CFR 2012, subpart A or 2012, \nsubpart B. \n \nE.

Leadership Designees, with the assistance of the Office of the General Counsel, should take appropriate actions to enforce the owner\u2019s agreement not to charge rent and to refund or credit any improperly charged rent.

Should the borrower be unable to rebate or credit improper shelter cost charges to affected residents because they cannot be located, the improper charges should be forwarded for processing as a miscellaneous payment for crediting to the revolving fund.  Borrowers should not receive \nindirect benefit from such improper actions such as having any improper collections \u201ccredited\u201d to the Government for application as a voluntary additional payment on loans owed the Government.

This type of non- compliance may require more aggressive servicing \nactions including additional supervisory visits.

  "page_125": " \n \n \n 4.1 INTRODUCTION  \n Successful projects require sound financial management procedures to track funds, \nprepare realistic budgets, manage project funds effectively, and report financial progress.   \nThis chapter covers the borrower\u2019s financial management responsibilities and provides guidance to MFH  Servicing Officials  on monitoring a borrower\u2019s financial management \nperformance. \n The chapter is divided into five sections : \n Section 1 :  Project Accounting System  describes program requirements and \nAgency monitoring responsibilities for the project accounting system.    Section 2 :  Project Accounts discusses the contribution, use, and monitoring of \nproject a ccounts.   \n Section 3 :  Reserve Accounts  outlines the requirements for and monitoring of \nreserve accounts.   \n Section 4 :  Project Budgets explains project proposed budget requirements and the \nbudget approval process.    Section 5 :  Reporting and Financial Examination  describes project actual  \nreporting and financial examinations and Agency review of these reports.   \nSECTION 1:  PROJECT ACCOUNTING SYSTEM  \n 4.2 OVERVIEW OF ACCOUNTING SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS [7 CFR 3560.302]  \n \nBorrowers must establish accounting systems that support safe and sound project \nfinancial management.  The accounting system must allow borrowers to  maintain records in \na manner suitable for an audit; track the use of funds, report accurate operational results to the Agency, and otherwise comply with the terms of their loan agreement.  The following requirements apply to the borrower\u2019s accounting system: \n \n\u2022 Agency approval.  The accounting system must be approved by the Agency as part of the management plan (as discussed in Chapter 3).  The borrower must notify the Agency of any changes in the method or system of accounting through a revision to the project management plan.\n \n \n CHAPTER 4:  FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT        \n________________________________________________________________________ ______  \n4-1 \n(07-19-24)  PN 619 HB-2-3560  ",
  "page_126": " \n \u2022 Method of accounting.  The borrower is required to use the accrual method of \naccounting throughout the year for bookkeeping and budget preparations.  Annual reporting must be convertible to the standards identified in \u00a73560.308.  \n\u2022 When the accrual method of accounting is used , the accrual -to-cash adjustment must \nequal the difference between  Beginning Cash Balance and Ending Cash Balance to \nensure these balances match their respective Balance Sheet figures.  The sole purpose \nof this adjustment is to reconcile a company\u2019s internal ledger , kept on an accrual \nbasis, to the IRS forms which are on a cash basis.   \n \n\u2022 Recordkeeping.  Borrowers must retain all financial records and supporting material for at least 3 years after the issuance of annual financial reports and financial statements or until the next Agency monitoring visit whichever is longer.  These records must be maintained in a manner that can be audited by the Agency or a third party.  Records may need to be retained longer for RD litigation holds, IRS retention rules or Ta x Credit Guidelines. Borrower accounts and records will be made available \nin a location with reasonable access for review at the request of the Agency. \n If an account i s a problem case or an investigation  or audit is in process, do not destroy \nmaterial until the problem is resolved or the investigation audit is closed.   \n \n\u2022 Account requirements.  The following general requirements apply to the borrower\u2019s accounts: \n \n\u25ca Accounts must be held in domestic institutions;  \n \n\u25ca Accounts must be held only in financial institution accounts insured by an \nagency of the Federal Government, or held in securities meeting the \nrequirements of 7 CFR part 3560, subpart G;   \n\u25ca Funds maintained in an institution may not exceed the limit established for Federal deposit insurance.  Funds exceeding the Federally insured limit under a Tax ID number must be moved to a different qualified banking institution that will ensure the funds unless the current financial institution provides additional surety, such as a collateral pledge that may already be in place; and   \n\u25ca Borrowers must maintain at least one demand deposit or checking account so that funds are always readily available to pay necessary operating expenses.   \nBorrowers must be able to account for housing project funds with accounting methods or practices that maintain the proprietary identity of the funds for each project.  \n \n\u2022 Use of funds.  Funds, other than those in the security deposit/membership fee or patron capital accounts, are considered assets of the property and must be held in \ntrust by the borrower until used .  The accounts serve as security , through \ntransfers or assumptions for the Agency loan or grant, until all outstanding balances are satisfied.     \n \n\u25ca In no case may project funds be pledged as collateral for non-project debts;  \n_____________________________________________________________ ___________  \n4-2 \n HB-2-3560  ",
  "page_127": " \n  \n\u25ca Funds must be used only for authorized purposes as described in 7 CFR part \n3560, subpart G and in the project loan agreement or resolution ; and \n \n\u25ca Priority Order of planned and actual project expenditures are discussed in 7 \nCFR, part 3560, subpart G. \n \n\u2022 Separate accountability.  The accounting system must establish separate \naccountability for different projects.  Funds for housing projects managed by the same management company must not be co -mingled.  \n \nThe borrower may combine funds from different projects owned by the same borrower with the same tax identification number or Social Security Number in the same bank account, as long as the accounting system segregates and tracks each project\u2019s funds separately.  A statement issued by a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) stating that the accounting system is structured to meet the principle of separate accountability will be provided.    If revenue or expenses are prorated among more than one project, then the management plan must document how revenue and expenses are prorated across projects.  For example, the plan must document how costs for a computer system that serves several projects are allocated across the projects.  The accounting system must track these prorated costs.   \n \n4.3 OVERVIEW OF ACCOUNTS  \n \nThe borrowers must establish and maintain the accounts required by their loan \nagreement or resolution.  At a minimum, these include the following accounts:  \n \n\u2022 General operating account; \n \n\u2022 Real estate t ax and insurance account ( if not part of the general operating account \nor unless escrowed by the Agency);  \n \n\u2022 Reserve account  (unless escrowed by the Agency in accordance with \u00a73560.65) ;  \n \n\u2022 Tenant security deposit account  \n \n\u2022 Membership fee account (if applicable); and  \n \n\u2022 For cooperative projects, a patron capital account. \n Each account serves a different purpose, as described in Section 2  and the project loan \nagreement or resolution .\n________________________________________________________________________ ______  \n4-3 \n(07-19-24)  PN 619 HB-2-3560  ",
  "page_128": " \n  \nSECTION 2:  PROJECT ACCOUNTS   \n \n4.4 GENERAL OPERATING ACCOUNT  \n \n         The borrower must establish a general operating account to handle all revenues and \nexpenses associated with project operations.  Authorized expenses payable from this account include expenses that are directly attributable to project operations and are nec essary to carry \nout successful project operations.  Attachment 4 -C addresses eligible and ineligible \noperating expenses. \n A. Initial Operating Capital and Other Advances  [7 CFR 3560.304]. \n The period between initial occupancy and full rent- up in a project can be risky \nbecause rental income may not be sufficient to cover all operating costs, make payments on the Agency loan, and make required contributions to the reserve fund.  To assist proj ects through this phase, the Agency requires the establishment of a fund \nfor Initial Operating Capital by the borrower for each project.  Approval of subsequent loans, transfer of ownership or other servicing actions may require additional deposits to the Operating Account and will be described in the loan, transfer or servicing approval.  \n \nThis Initial Operating Capital is to be used for initial operating expenses, such as advertising, insurance, fidelity coverage, and initial lease-up expenses.  The funds may also be used to meet project obligations, such as debt payments and reserve deposits, until cash flow is sufficient to fund these accounts.   In addition to these regular operating expenses, there are some special expenses associated with this period, such as purchasing furniture or equipment for public spaces or advertising and marketi ng.  Borrowers  are to provide the Agency with a list of proposed uses for \nInitial Operating Capital during loan origination.  \n Other Advances include any advances made by the borrower, borrower entity, or designee to cover ordinary project operating expenses.  \n\u2022 Funding  of Initial Operating Capital \n \nAll borrowers must provide Initial Operating Capital equal to at least 2 percent of the total development costs  to support initial operation of the project.  Borrowers \nmust put this amount down at the loan closing or construction start, whichever comes first.  The Agency may loan the required 2 percent to not- for-profit \nborrowers.  (For details on this process, see Chapter 5 of HB -1-3560.) \n   \n\u2022 Accounting for  Initial Operating Capital  \n When the project accounts are established, Initial Operating Capital is blended with other revenue and used for operating expenses.  The borrower may leave an \namount of money equal to the initial capitalization of the fund in the operating  account.  This money should not be treated as surplus funds in the operating account nor should it be transferred to reserves.  Its presence in the operating \n_____________________________________________________________________________  \n4-4 HB-2-3560  ",

Projects vary as to when they achieve this stability; the Agency anticipates it occurs sometime between the end of the second and seventh year of occupancy.  When project stability is reached  before the end of the seventh year , a for -profit \nborrower whose cash contribution created the Initial Operating Capital may request that the contribution be repaid .   \n \n\u2022 Repayment  \n \n\u25ca Agency Policy \n \nThe borrower may, with the consent of the Agency, withdraw its original contribution to the Initial Operating Capital in multiple annual installments or a single installment after the second year of the housing project operations and prior to the seventh full year of project operation, provided the borrower can satisfy Agency criteria for approving repayment .  Repayment can only be \nmade once the project has been operating for 2 years, and the project\u2019s operations and finances have stabilized.  Repayment may  be requested in one \nto five  annual installments, until the borrower\u2019s contribution to Initial \nOperating Capital has been fully repaid  and prior to the close of year seven.   \nThe borrower must be able to demonstrate that the project is financially stable, that repayment  will not require a rent increase, and that the project is \nin compliance with Agency requirements.   The financial condition of the \nproject may preclude full repayment of Initial Operating Capital.     \n \n\u25ca Borrower Submissions  \n The borrower may submit a request for repayment  of Initial Operating Capital \nwhen the annual financial  report is submitted.  The borrower\u2019s request is \nsubmitted in writing and addressed to the MFH Servicing Offic ial. \n   The submission should specify the amount of the repayment the borrower is requesting in the current year and, if applicable, the borrower\u2019s plan for withdrawing the balance of the repayment in ensuing years.  The submission includes documentation demonstrating how the project meets Agency criteria for repayment:    \uf0a7 Occupancy.   The occupancy rate for the project over the most recent 12 \nmonths has averaged at least 90 percent. \n________________________________________________________________________ ______  \n4-5 \n (07-19-24)  PN 619 HB-2-3560  ",

When the amount of the \nrepayment is subtracted from the general operating account , the ending \ncash balance still includes an amount equal to 20 percent of projected annual operating costs and required escrows for real estate taxes and \ninsurance.    \n\uf0a7 Impact on Rents:  \n \no Repayment is acceptable if no rent increases are projected in the year the repayment is made.   \n o A rent increase will not affect repayment if rents are increasing to cover increases in costs, such as wages, taxes, or insurance.   \n o Repayment is denied if it creates a shortfall in operating income that must be made up by a rent increase and/or funded by the owner.  \n \n\uf0a7 Physical M aintenance. There are no outstanding deficiencies in \nmanagement\u2019s physical maintenance of the housing project in accordance with 7 CFR 3560.354. \n \n\uf0a7 Compliance .

Return on Investment/Return to Owner [7 CFR 3560.305] \n \nThe borrower\u2019s R eturn on Investment (ROI) is the annual amount of profit an \nowner operating on a limited or full- profit basis may receive from a project, as \nestablished in the loan agreement .  When a property has a transfer of ownership,\nROI is referred to as a Return to Owner (RTO) and is based upon the transfer \nunderwriting analysis and approval conditions.  The amount is calculated as a \npercentage of the owner\u2019s investment in the project.    \n The borrower may take the earned ROI/RTO (Return) before withdrawing the \noriginal contribution to Initial Operating Capital.  A full or partial Return  may be \ntaken in a given year.  If only a partial is taken, the remainder may be taken the following year if allowed .  The b orrower may receive a Return  in accordance \nwith the terms of its  loan agreement, and if the following conditions exist:  \n \n1. The borrower may take the Return  after the project\u2019s fiscal year ends if there \nis a positive net cash flow (see line 30 on Form RD 3560-7, Multiple Family \nHousing Project Budget/Utility Allowance ), and the balance of the reserve \naccount is equal to or greater than required deposits minus authorized withdrawals .  \n When determining positive net cash flow, the Agency will consider such items as accounts payable and reserve withdrawals to cover operating expenses.  For example, the borrower may not circumvent the order for funding accounts by using reserve funds or creating an accounts payable for budgeted operating expenses to make it appear as though the budget has a positive cash flow at year  end. If the annual financial reports indicate that the \nborrower should not have taken a Return, the Agency will require the borrower to re pay the unauthorized Return  to the project.   \n \n2. If the project\u2019s operations show a negative cash flow (see Form RD 3560-7,  line 30) as in the Example, Case 1 below , the Agency may authorize the \nborrower to take the Return  only after the Agency has reviewed the project\u2019s \nannual financial report and determines:  \n \n\u25ca There is surplus cash in either the general operating account or surplus \noperating cash in the reserve account and ; \n \n\u25ca The housing project has sufficient funds to address identified capital or \noperational needs.

In this \nexample, \u201cF Y 20 X7 RTO\u201d would be noted in the comments section of   \n Form 3560-7.  This Return  would be taken immediately after the end of the fiscal \nyear, preferably January 20X8.   After the $1,000 RTO was paid, if all or a portion of the previous year (20X6) RTO is unpaid - it may be paid from the remaining surplus cash.   Any remaining previous years unpaid RTO will then be written off.   Case 2 :  If the project had a n egative cash flow during F Y 20 X7 but had only \n$5,000 available in the general operating account, the Agency would not approve a Return  from funds available at the end of F Y 20X7.  This FY 20X7 RTO could be \nrequested the following year if there is surp lus cash to cover it, the 20X8 RTO is \npaid first and it does not cause a rent increase.

During F Y 20 X7, the \nborrower believed that there would not be adequate cash to pay taxes at year end, \nso the borrower requested $2,000 from the reserve account for operating purposes; \nhowever, the project ended the year with $3,000 positive cash flow .  In this case, \nthe borrower can take the $1,000 without Agency permission, as they used a reserve withdrawal request to cover operating expenses.

Generally, these funds can be kept in the general operating account as long as they are tracked separately from other general operating funds to ensure that funds are available to pay taxes and insurance.  In some cas es, however, the Agency may require an \nescrow  account for taxes and insurance to ensure the availability of these funds.  See \nChapter 3 for a discussion of insurance requirements and taxes.   Also, see Attachment 4 -D \nBudget and Year End Analysis for evaluation of escrow amounts. \n \n4.6 RESERVE ACCOUNT  \n \nThe reserve account is used primarily to pay for large, planned  expenses for \nmaintenance and improvements of capital items.  It is funded through contributions from \nproject operating funds.  The reserves are not to be used as an alternative operating budget.  \nThe project\u2019s reserves must be held in a supervised bank account.  The Agency must approve all withdrawals from the reserve account.

Funds deposited in the security deposit/membership fee account must \nbe used for purposes outlined in the management plan: \n \n\u25ca The borrower may only use security deposits to cover costs of fixing damage to units beyond ordinary wear and tear by the tenant who provided the deposit.  The funds must be returned to the tenant if not used in accordance with the State Law.   \nIf the borrower cannot locate the tenant to return the deposit, these funds must be \ndeposited in the general operating account or handled in accordance with applicable state laws.  In cooperatives, the return of membership fees depends upon \nthe legal instruments governing the project.  \n \n\u25ca Funds retained by the borrower as a result of a lease or occupancy violation must \nbe transferred to the general operating account and treated as project income.  \n \n HB-2-3560  \n________________________________________________________________________ ______  \n4-12 \n ",

In no case may interest accrue to the benefit of the borrower or management agent. \n \n4.8 PATRON CAPITAL ACCOUNT  \n \nIn cooperative projects, borrowers must establish a patron capital account to hold \nsurplus operating funds in trust for cooperative shareholders .   \n \n\u2022 Any funds in excess of 3 months of average operating expenses remaining in the general operating account at the end of the fiscal year must be deposited in the patron capital account.

During this \nperiod, which can be as long as 50 years, major replacements and capital expenditures will have to be made to the building, such as replacing the roof, rewiring, replacing windows, doing major exterior work, or adding new kitchen and bathroom fixtures.  The reserve \naccount is primarily used to meet the major capital expense needs of a project.  If these expenditures are not made, the property loses value, becomes less attractive to tenants, and begins to deteriorate .  The  Agency\u2019s financial interest  in the project is then at risk.  \n Adequate replacement reserves are a critical component of a successful project.  The reserves are not to be used as an alternative operating budget.  Rents should reflect and cover \nthe reasonable and customary costs of annual operating expenses of the property in the market.   Annual reserve deposit for projects with Agency approved Capital Needs \nAssessments (CNA) will be adjusted as authorized in the loan, transfer or servicing approval.  \n        HB-2-3560  \n________________________________________________________________________ ______  \n4-13 \n(07-19-24)  PN 619 ",

The borrower will initiate deposits in this project account, starting in the same month the first loan payment is due the Agency.  As projects age, the required reserve account level may be adjusted to meet anticipated life-cycle needs, such as equipment and facility replacement costs, by amending the loan agreement/resolution.  Refer to Attachment 4 -B for guidance on the amendment.  \n \nRequirements for the reserve account include the following:  \nAll Rural Rental Housing, Rural Cooperative Housing, and Farm Labor Housing borrowers are required to establish and maintain a reserve account.

Reserve account funds may be held in the form of: \n \n\u25ca A checking, savings, negotiable order of withdrawal, or similar account at a federally -insured domestic institution, such as a bank, savings and loan, or \ncredit union.  \n\u25ca Readily marketable obligations of the U.S. Treasury Department (e.g., U.S. Treasury bonds, U.S. Savings bonds, zero coupon bonds, etc.) at a federally-insured domestic institution or at an insured domestic institution authorized to sell securities.  \n \n\u25ca An account established at an insured domestic institution authorized to sell \nsecurities, provided that the accounts meet the remaining conditions set out in this paragraph and are not used in a speculative manner.  The account may be \na tax -exempt  account or a taxable account, and the institution may or may not \ncharge brokerage fees.   \nB. Limitations on Investments in Securities  \n Any securities must be:  \n \n\u25ca Backed by the U.S. Government or an Agency of the U.S. Government;  \n \n\u25ca Triple A -rated Government National Mortgage Association  (GNMA) -\ncollateralized tax -exempt bonds; or  \n \n   \n________________________________________________________________________ ______  \n4-16 \n HB-2-3560  ",
  "page_141": " \n  \n \n\u25ca Triple A -rated pre-refunded bonds.  \nPre-refunded bonds are bonds that originally may have been issued as general \nobligation or revenue bonds but are now secured, until the call date or maturity, by an escrow fund consisting entirely of direct Government obligations that are sufficient for paying the bondholders.  \n \nC. Reporting Actual Costs of Securities  To en sure that required amounts have been paid into the reserve account, the \nactual  costs of securities (which in many cases may not be the face value) must \nbe shown on the project books.  In addition, details of these transactions should be disclosed in footnotes to financial information provided to the Agency.  1. Security Sales  When the Agency approves withdrawals from the reserve account and the funds are i nvested in securities, borrowers must, to the extent that securities \nare available, assure that securities are sold in an amount that results in \nproceeds sufficient to cover the disbursement.  \n \n2. Forecasting Security Sales  \n Since the sale or redemption of any securities may result in cash proceeds of less than the amount invested, borrowers should take steps to minimize the risk of loss from converting securities to cash.  Needed reserve account withdrawals should be planned in advance to permit Agency approval of anticipated needs such that security sales can be arranged to be sold in favorable market conditions.  When sales of securities take place, the proceeds will normally be held in a reserve fund at a domestic bank, sav ings \nand loan, credit union, or similar institution insured by an Agency of the Federal Government until such time as withdrawals are needed for the purposes authorized.  Should unusual circumstances require the sale of securities in unfavorable market con ditions, the borrower will not be required \nto reimburse the project for any losses incurred.   \n3. Knowledge Required of Securities Investors  \n Those investing in securities must be knowledgeable of common industry practices prior to investing in securities. Knowledge of the various fees that may be associated with  the purchase and sale of securities and the \nmaintenance of security accounts must be considered when making security \ninvestments .  Examples of these fees are front-end loads of fees, back -end \nloads of fees, and maintenance fees. These fees may be paid using general \noperating acc ount or reserve account funds.  However, the Agency must give \nits prior consent  before reserve account funds may be used.   \n \n \n________________________________________________________________________ ______  \n4-17 \n(07-19-24)  PN 619  HB-2-3560  ",

Financial Advisor Limitations  \n Project proceeds may not be permitted to be used to pay for the services of a financial advisor to assist in the selecti on of securities for investment, since \nthe securities permitted are relatively limited and must meet the requirements set out in  this chapter .  However,  normal brokerage fees may be paid to \nsecure and sell securities.   It is recognized that  financial advice may also be \nprovided as part of the normal brokerage fee.  \n4.13 USE OF THE RESERVE ACCOUNT  \n \nA. Planned Use of Reserve Funds  The borrower will request approval for use of the reserve funds using Form  RD \n3560-12, Request for Authorization to Withdraw Reserve Funds, before funds are needed  if items were not included on the approved capital budget.  The borrower \nwill request withdrawal from the reserve fund using Form RD 3560-12.  Annual budgets are to include realistic routine income and expense levels to avoid the need to use reserve funds for routine expenses (operating shortfalls) not caused by emergencies or very unusual servicing situations.  The Agency expects borrowers to anticipate and plan for major capital expenditures at least annually, including a careful review of any approved CNA. The MFH  Servic ing Official \nwill monitor planned capital needs and expenditures to determine if revisions will be necessary and document the file accordingly. \n \nThe borrower is required to submit an annual capital expenditure budget as part of the annual budget submission.  Th e budget should include plans to catch up \nwith any maintenance expenses deferred from previous years, correct any deficiencies identified during Agency site visits , complete capital repairs and \nreplacements scheduled in the project\u2019s approved CNA, and/ or make necessary \nmodifications to remove physical barriers as identified in a Transition Plan .

Unanticipated Uses of Reserves  \n The Agency recognizes that not all capital expenditures can be predicted a year in advance.  Sometimes a major piece of equipment will break down unexpectedly or a severe storm will create damage.  Borrowers must seek Agency approval for the unforeseen use of reserves.  In emergency situations when the borrower can demonstrate an imminent and serious threat to the health, safety, or physical security of the project, the borrower may request the Agency to post-approve the use of reserves.  The Agency will only approve emergency withdrawals if the reserves are used for eligible expenses.   If post- approval is requested, the bidding \nrequirements, as descri bed below, still apply .  If the bid is obtained post-approval \nand is less than the expense, the difference will be reimbursed to the account by the borrower.

Withdrawal Approval Process \n \n\u2022 The borrower must submit a written request, on Form RD 3560-12, \u201c Request for \nAuthorization to Withdraw Reserve Funds\u201d, to the Agency to withdraw reserve funds, even if the Agency has reviewed and approved the capital expenditures in its review of the annual capital budget.  \n\u2022 The MFH  Servicing Official will take prompt action on a request for reserve \nwithdrawal, normally within 5 working days of receipt of the request , and \nprovide written authorization to the borrower, on Form RD 3560-12, for any authorized withdrawal of funds before the borrower actually withdraws any funds.   \n\u2022 When an Agency approved Form RD 402-1A, \u201cSample Deposit Agreement\u201d or \u201cDeposit Account Control Agreement,\u201d other than Form RD 402-1 has been fully executed after September 28, 2018, the borrower may use electronic transfer of reserve funds upon receipt of Agency approval to withdraw reserve funds.  After the reserve withdrawal is approved by the Agency, reserve funds can be electronically transferred to the operating account for disbursement.  These funds will be recorded as a withdrawal from the reserve account on the annual financial report submission.   \n\u2022 Borrowers will notify the MFH  Servicing Official of work completed within 5 \ndays so that needed inspections may occur.  \n \n\u2022 Borrowers will submit a final invoice that describes the specific service and \nbanking transaction if the amount is different than initially approved  or was a \npreapproved capital budget item.  \n \n\u2022 Borrowers must maintain records documenting all expenses that were paid by withdrawals from the reserve account.    \n1. Bid Requirements  \n Expenditures of $10,000 or less for MFH properties with 24 units or less, or \n$25,000 or less for MFH properties with 25 units or more  do not require \nmultiple bids , even if it is an identity -of-interest (IOI) entity.   \n The expenditure of reserve funds for a project (all work included in one contract) estimated to cost more  than $10,000 ( for MFH properties with 24 \nunits or less ) or more than $25,000 (for MFH properties with 25 units or \nmore ) will require a minimum of two bids.

Projects Involving Moderate Levels of Construction  \n If construction does not involve substantial changes to structures or replacement of major systems, e.g. electrical, plumbing, heating, or cooling, the housing project  is considered to  involve moderate levels of construction.  \nExamples include exterior repainting, roof repair, parking lot repaving, and repairs to plumbing or electrical systems.    When the borrower requests access to reserves for a moderate construction activity, the Agency first reviews the project documents  for acceptance , and \nthen reviews a payment request.    \n In addition to the items for bids specified above, the borrower must provide the following : \n \n\u2022 Project planning documents that describe the work to be performed;  \n\u2022 Copies of written bids; and  \n \n\u2022 A copy of the contract/proposal. \n \nAfter the project has been completed, the borrower notifies the MFH  \nServicing Official with actual invoice /cost .  The MFH  Servicing Official will \nperform an inspection of the work done to assure it has been completed in \naccordance with the contract/agreement or statement of work if applicable.   \n \n3.

After the planning documents and construction contract have been accepted by the Agency, the borrower may request an initial draw to pay for materials or make a down payment to the contractor.  The request for an initial draw  should be accompanied by an invoice and a check made out to the contractor or vendor, to be cosigned by the Agency. The Agency may approve such a request provided the amount of the initial draw does not exceed a reasonable percentage of the value of the construction contract.  Refer to RD Instruction \n1924- A. \n The Agency will inspect the project before approving the work and again at construction completion before approving the final payment.   \n \n\u2022 The purpose of the initial inspection is to establish that the proposed work is needed and  is an appropriate response to existing conditions.   \n \n\u2022 The purpose of the final inspection is to establish that the work was \nperformed as described in the Agency- accepted documents.  \n \nThe Agency may conduct additional inspections as necessary.   \n The borrower may  hire an independent third -party inspector to verify that the \nwork complies with all applicable requirements.   To verify that all major \nsystems are adequate, State -licensed inspectors must certify that the dwelling \nhas been inspected and meets Agency standards.  When a State does not have \nlicensed inspectors, a qualified, independent, third- party inspector may \nprovide these certifications.  \n \n4.

General Information  \n Project budgets are planning documents that provide a picture of a project \u2019s \nfinancial operations  for the coming year.  They reflect:  \n \n\u2022 Expected revenues and expenses;  \n \n\u2022 Plans for maintenance, capital improvements, and reserve account activity ;  \n \n\u2022 Return on the owner\u2019s investment , or a Non-P rofit Asset Management Fee ;  \n \n\u2022 Establish rents ; and \n \n\u2022 Reasonable and customary costs to cover turnover costs and maintenance  \nwhich should be in line with the housing project\u2019s history, current circumstances, and market conditions.   \nFor projects with 8 units or more, all borrowers will be required to submit project \nbudgets through the Management Agent Interactive Network ( MINC).  The \nAgency may make an exception to this requirement if the borrower submits documentation that the costs associated with electronic submission of project budgets would pose a financial hardship to the project.  Borrowers must submit annual project budgets to the Agency for approval.  Budgets must meet the following requirements:  \n \n\u2022 Budgets must be reasonable and realistic.  Revenues, vacancies and expenses must be consistent with past project budgets , historical actuals, current \ncircumstances, and  market conditions.  Any differences must be due to legitimate operating needs of the project.  \n \n\u2022 Project expenses will include only expenses necessary to maintain successful \nprojects.  An example of an unnecessary expense is owner or manager entertainment expenses.  Project expenses cannot be used for unearned personal benefit or gain, or for reimbursement of false or ina ccurate expenses.   \n \n\u2022 The priority order of project expenditures must be: \n \no Senior Position lien holder, if any; \n \no Operating and maintenance expenses, including taxes and insurance; \n \no Debt service to the Agency;  \n \n________________________________________________________________________ ______  \n4-25 \n(07-19-24)  PN 619  HB-2-3560  ",

Refer to the Forms Manual Insert (FMI) for this form and for a detailed explanation of each line item on the budget.  The form is divided in 6 parts as described below: \n 1. Part I - Cash Flow Statement   For budgeting purposes, the cash flow statement projects whether the property will generate enough revenues for all cash needs for the budget period.  The proposed budget ending balance must be a positive cash balance and not cause an unwarranted rent increase, nor should it exceed the total of:  (1) approximately 20 percent of Total O&M Expenses ( Part I, line 16); (2) \nthe amount held for taxes and insurance; (3) any initial operating capital \nduring the first 7 years or until it is withdrawn, whichever comes first.   \nAccrual method accounting will be considered with the annual financial \nreports and is discussed in Section 5 of this chapter . \n \n\u2022 The borrower must not include expenses for purposes unrelated to the \nhousing project or for fines, penalties, and legal fees in the event  the \nborrower has been found guilty of violating laws such as civil rights, \nevictions, and building codes.   \n\u2022 The borrower is responsible for submitting  project budgets that address \nthe project\u2019s physical accessibility needs.  The MFH  Servicing Official \nmay approve the cost of providing accessible rental housing as an authorized use of project funds.  \n \n\u2022 The borrower must not include organizational expenses among project expenses.  These items are covered by the management fee.

Borrowers should include expected \nunit turnover expenses, based on the properties historic turnover rate, in the operating budget.  Turnover expenses, such as the replacement of a refrigerator, scheduled unit carpet cleaning, curtain or flooring cleaning or replacement, painting, etc. should be treated as a normal operating \noccurrence and do not represent a reserve account need.  If the unit sustains damages beyond reasonable wear and tear, then an exception may be warranted, as the costs may be abnormal.  This is not the typical situation.  If an item is budgeted in the annual operating budget as an operating expense, the item must be paid for out of the operating budget, unless it is a circumstance beyond the borrower\u2019s control.  \n \n\u2022 Utilities  include only utilities paid by the project.  Utilities paid by the \ntenant are not included on this form.  \n \n\u2022 Administrative  expenses are project expenses only  and do not include \nexpenses that a management firm incurs.

Part III - Account Budgeting/Status  \n \nThis section of the budget reflects the projected reserve account.  The \nbalance s of the other accounts are not completed for budgeting purposes, only \nwhen actuals are received.  \n \nThe MFH  Servicing Official must review the reserve account levels and \ncontributions to ensure that they are consistent with the loan agreement.  The review focuses on four items:  \n \n________________________________________________________________________ ______  \n4-28 \n HB-2-3560  ",
  "page_153": " \n \u25ca Beginning balance.  This is an estimate of the balance in the account \nas of the beginning of the proposed budget period.  The MFH  \nServicing Official should review the beginning balance of the reserve \naccount to ensure accuracy.  \n\u25ca Transfers to reserves.   The MFH  Servicing Official should examine \nthe budget to ensure that the appropriate dollar amount, as specified in the loan agreement/loan resolution, is budgeted for deposit in the reserve account.  \n \n\u25ca Transfers from reserves.  Any transfers from the reserve account that are included in the budget should be described in the budget narrative and justified by the capital plan.    \n\u25ca Ending balance.  The ending reserve account balance is calculated by taking the beginning balance, adding the transfers to the reserve account, and subtracting the transfers from the reserve account.   \n \nIf the MFH  Servicing Official finds that the reserve account level is not \nwhere it is supposed to be, that the budget does not show correct contributions to reserves, or that transfers from reserves are not adequately documented, then the borrower must submit corrected budget documents. \n \n3. Part IV - Rent Schedule and Utility Allowance  \n The rent schedule documents the rent and utility allowance structure , and \nestablishes the Rental Incom e entered in Form RD 3560-7, Part I, Line 1.   \n \n\u25ca The Basic R ent is the level required to cover all uses of cash and the \nrepayment of the Rural Development loan at the interest credit reduced payment.    \n\u25ca The Note Rate rent is the level required to cover all uses of cash and the repayment of the Rural Development loan at the unsubsidized or promissory note rate.   \n When tenants pay some or all of their utility costs themselves, borrowers must establish a utility allowance to determine the amount tenants pay toward rent.  The utility allowance is deducted from the total shelter cost calculated for the tenant, and the difference is paid by the tenant as rent.  If the tenant is entitled to a utility reimbursement, management companies may issue a joint check payable to the tenant and utility company, if they choose.       \n________________________________________________________________________ ______  \n4-29 \n(07-19-24)  PN 619 HB-2-3560  ",

Part V- Annual Capital Budget   \n \nThe capital budget portion of Form RD 3560-7, Part V provides information \non plans for capital improvements and will assist the Agency on utilization of the reserve account for future rent increase requests.  It lists all the capital items in the project and provides space for the borrower to indicate their condition, address transition plan items and any needed improvements.  The \nAnnual Capital Budget allows capital items to either be expensed from operations or capitalized from the reserve.   \n The borrower identifies major maintenance , replacement and accessibility \nneeds during the annual budget cycle and develops a schedule for making withdrawals from the reserve account to pay for their cost. These plans are incorporated by the borrower into the annual capital expenditure budget and may also be reflected in the operating budget if the work is to be paid for out of operating income.  Attachment 4-A offers guidance for budgeting capital items.  The objective is to help ensure the borrower properly manage s reserve \naccount resources and establish es budgets to address the project\u2019s capital \nneeds.  \n If the MFH  Servicing Official finds the operating and capital budgets \ninadequate to keep the project in compliance with Agency standards for physical conditions [7 CFR 3560.103] , the MFH  Servicing Official must \nrequest the borrower to modify the annual capital plan.  The MFH  Servic ing \nOfficial may also request modifications if it is found that the borrower has \nproposed expenditures to be paid from reserves that should be charged to the operating account.  \n5. Part VI - Narrative, Signatures, Dates and Comments  \nThis section of the form will be used to complete the borrower\u2019s Budget \nNarrative, Signatures, Dates and Comments.  \n \nProposed Budget Narrative: \n \nThe budget narrative provides a description of the budget and highlights important elements to aid MFH  Servicing Officials  in their review of the \nbudget.

For example:  \n \no Costs are comparable to the costs for similar properties in the conventional market.  In this example, t he borrower might \nshow that insurance costs for the same coverage at a conventional project are comparable to the costs for the project shown in the budget.  \no The factors contributing to the cost increases are beyond the \nborrower\u2019s control and the borrower is actively implementing \ncost-containment measures.   For example, the project is \nsubject to utility rate or tax increases.    \n  \no The cost increase is needed to cover actions to address identified physical deficiencies that are not due to negligence by the borrower or the management agent.

All borrowers, including those using the Department of Housing and Urban Development ( HUD ) project-based Section 8 contract assistance, \nmust obtain prior Agency approval for a rent increase.  Changes in rental rates will apply to all units in a project.  Rent change requests for multi-family housing projects with no HUD subsidy are typically submitted and reviewed at the same time the borrower submits an annual budget for \napproval.  Rent changes in HUD project - based Section 8  projects \nresulting from rent increases by HUD must also be reviewed and  are not \nto be automatically approved.  As with any Section 515 project, only the \namount of rent necessary to cover project expenses must be approved.    \n\u2022 Annual Utility Allowance Reviews  \n \nThe borrower must review utility allowances on an annual basis to determine whether any changes need  to be made.  The borrower must \nindicate changes or no changes to utility rates in the budget narrative.  \nIf all utilities are included in the rent (utilities are paid by the project), \nthere is no utility allowance  review .   \nSetting Utility Allowances : \nThe utility allowance is based on expected costs for utilities that are paid by the tenants.  Once established, the borrower must review the utility allowance annually. This is done in conjunction with the annual budget process.

The narrative attached to the budget form must clearly explain the necessity for the change request, and the MFH  Servicing Official must analyze the \nsupporting documentation to the budget Form RD 3560-7, to see if it supports the request.  For example, if the rent increase is due to increased taxes, then the MFH  Servicing Official should look for copies of tax increase notices in \nthe budget documentation.  If the rent increase is due to an increase in general operating expenses, the MFH  Servicing Official must review those expenses \nfor reasonableness.  \n \n\u2022 Late Budget Submissions \n The schedule provided for budget reviews relies on timely submission of budget documents by the borrower.  If the borrower is tardy in submitting required documents, the Agency cannot ensure that all deadlines will be met.  Therefore, if a borrower submits the budget late, Agency deadlines no longer apply, and the borrower is not eligible for \u201cautomatic approval\u201d of the budget (as discussed in Paragraph 4.14 D of this chapter ).  If no budget is approved \nby the end of the project\u2019s fiscal year, the borrower must operate under the previously approved budget ( similar to a C arry-Over budget) until the \nAgency reviews and approves the new budget. \n \n\u2022 Carry- Over Budgets \n \nIf a budget for the new fiscal year is not entered in MFIS before the first day \nof the fiscal year, a Carry -Over budget is  automatically built from the prior \nyear budget on the first day of the project\u2019s fiscal year by MFIS.  If there is a \ntransmitted date, the budget has been \u201centered\u201d and a Carry -Over budget will \nnot be created.  If the denied step is populated, a Carry -Over budget will also \nnot be created.  This is necessary as the borrower has not presented an acceptable budget in time to be effective o n the first day of the project\u2019s fiscal \nyear and is, therefore, operating under the current existing budget , which \nwould then become the C arry-Over budget . \n \nWhen an acceptable budget is received , after the beginning of the fiscal year, \na Mid -Year Budget will need to be completed. \n \n\u2022 Mid-Year Budgets \n A Mid -Year Budget is a type of budget that is  used if there is a change in \nrents or utilities at the project that is  effective other than the first day of the \nproject\u2019s fiscal year.  \n \nThe borrower\u2019s submission  must include operating income and expenses that \nwould be expected for the next 12 months after the effective date of the budget.

However, there are certain procedures that differ. These procedures are discussed later in the chapter.  \n \n1. Receiving the Budget  \nStandard procedures for budget receipt will help MFH Servicing Officials  track \nthe progress of budgets through the review process and meet Agency deadlines.  \nFurther, intake procedures should help prioritize the review of budgets so that those with the highest priority (e.g., those with rent or utility allowance changes) receive \nthe attention they need in a timely manner. The following steps are taken upon receipt of budget submissions: \n \n\u25ca When hard copies of the Form RD 3560-7 budget are submitted, the \ndocuments must be date stamped, entered into MFIS  (complete  \nreceived  date and input the financial details) , and forward to the \nappropriate MFH Servicing Official for review.\n  \n \n\u25ca When budgets are transmitted through MINC, the submission of a hard \ncopy of Form RD 3560-7 is not required.  The MFH  Servic ing Official \nwill find the budget under Industry Interface in MFIS.  If the budget \ntransmission is accepted, the system will complete the transmitted date for this item.   The following items are needed for the budget to be \naccepted  by the MFIS system : \n \n\u25ca Effective day must be 1\nst of the month. \n \n\u25ca Effective day must be within the fiscal year range.  \n ________________________________________________________________________ ______  \n4-38 \n HB-2-3560  ",

Refer to Exhibit 4 -1 for \ncomplete budget submission requirements.  \n \n\u25ca If\n the budget submission is complete, the MFH Servicing Official will \ninput the received date in MFIS and the budget review should \ncontinue as described in the following sections .  If the budget is \nincomplete, the MFH  Servicing Official must take the steps described \nbelow.  \n\u25ca Incomplete Budgets : \nIf any items are missing or are of such poor quality that there is insufficient information to begin an assessment of the budget, the budget is considered incomplete.    If the budget submission is incomplete, the MFH  Servicing Official \nmust contact the borrower in writing , stating that the budget is \nincomplete, and discuss the deficiencies.  \n \n\u25ca If the borrower submits the information within 10 days, the budget \nis considered to be on time, and the review can still be completed \nwithin the required timeline.  The budget is eligible for automatic \napproval, as described later in this chapter.   \n \n\u25ca If the borrower does not submit the requested information within a \n10-day time period from the Agency\u2019s contact, the Agency cannot \nguarantee approval of the budget before the beginning of the new fiscal year.  If the budget cannot be effective  at the beginning of \nthe project\u2019s fiscal year, the borrower must continue operations under the previous year\u2019s budget until a budget is approved.

If the initial \nbudget is denied, this schedule allows for a second review of \nthe budget and approval (if appropriate) before the start of the fiscal year.  \n \n2. Prioritizing Budgets for Review  \n After budgets have been received and determined to be complete, the MFH  Servicing Official should prioritize budgets for review.  Prioritizing \nthe budgets helps to ensure that the budgets that require the most thorough review receive the attention they need.  Budgets with the highest priority for review include budgets for projects with:  \n \n\u2022 Requests for rent increases above $25 /month ; \n \n\u2022 Vacancy rates above the allowable threshold; and  \n \n\u2022 Past monitoring findings.  \n While MFH Servicing Officials  should place the highest priority on \nreviewing these budgets, they should plan their time to allow for sufficient review of all budgets.  \n \n3. Reviewing Outstanding Monitoring Findings  \n Having determined that the budget submission is complete, the MFH  \nServicing Official must check the project for outstanding monitoring  \nfindings and  assess whether the borrower\u2019s budget reflects adequate \nefforts to address these findings.   \n \n\u2022 If the outstanding monitoring issues have been adequately addressed in the budget , the MFH  Servicing Official should proceed with the review \nfor reasonableness.   \n \nIf project outstanding monitoring issues have not been addressed, the budget documents should be returned to the borrower for revision.    \n________________________________________________________________________ ______  \n4-40 \n HB-2-3560  ",

Attachment 4 -D shows the items included in the analysis \nand how they are calculated. \n \n\u2022 Review Form RD 3560-7 to verify that all appropriate line items are completed.  Perform a quick assessment to ensure that they appear to be completed properly. \n \n\u2022 Complete the budget analysis which is required prior to entering an \n\u201cApproved\u201d date in the Supervisory Activity of MFIS.  The analysis \nwill reflect areas of observations and review items which  will require \ncomments .

  "page_167": " \n  \n \n5. Review the of Rent or Utility Allowance Change Request s \n When the borrower submits a budget with a rent or utility allowance change request, the Agency must respond to the borrower within 30 calendar days  of submission.  If the Agency does not contact the borrower \nand the budget is eligible for automatic approval, the borrower may assume that any rent change request of $25 per month or less has been automatically approved.  The MFH Servicing Official must complete the MFIS budget analysis, notify the borrower in writing, and update the Approval date in MFIS.    Even if the MFH Servicing Official has determined that the budget is \nreasonable based on the tests outlined in Attachment  4-D, the rent \nincrease must still be reviewed to confirm that the rent/utility allowance change will not adversely affect the marketability of the units and create a vacancy problem.  If a review of the rent increase shows that the rent increase will adversel y affect the marketability of units, the full rent \nincrease cannot be approved.  The borrower should seek a reduced rent increase and, if appropriate, request a servicing action that will enable the project to achieve a positive cash flow at lower rents.  The Agency will not consider rent increases based solely on guaranteeing that the borrower will rece ive a  Return  on Investment at the end of the project\u2019s fiscal year.   \n \na. Circumstances in which the Agency May Deny a Rent Increase \nRequest  \n The MFH  Servicing Official may deny a rent increase request under \nthe following circumstances:  \n \n\u2022 The borrower is able but unwilling to comply with program \nrequirements.  Such a borrower has ignored repeated requests \nfrom the MFH Servicing Official to take servicing actions by a specified deadline.  \n \n\u2022 If the borrower is in default of the Agency loan agreement and does not have an Agency-approved workout plan or  is not in \ncompliance with an Agency-approved workout plan.  \n\u2022 There are sufficient project funds under the existing rents to meet project operating expenses, and the borrower is not able to justify the higher rents.  Such a condition is established when the project budget shows that income meets expenses at current rent levels.  \n________________________________________________________________________ ______  \n4-43 \n(07-19- 24)  PN 619  HB-2-3560  ",
  "page_168": " \n \u2022 The project is operated on a for-profit basis, and the rent change \nwould result in rents higher than what tenants can afford.  This condition is established by comparing rents with 30 percent of tenant- adjusted incomes.  If it is shown that tenants would be \npaying in excess of 30 percent of their adjusted incomes with  new \nrents and the increase is not necessary to meet projected costs, then the increase must not be approved.  \nIf the MFH  Servicing Official denies the change request, the borrower \nmust be notified of the denial and be provided with appeal rights.  (See Chapter 1) \n \nb. Effective Dates of Change  \nThe effective dates of any approved changes will coincide with the start of the project\u2019s fiscal year or the start of the season for labor-housing projects.  Handbook Letter 204 (3560) will be sent to notify tenants of RD decision to approve rent or utility allowance change . \n \nFor notices to tenants, see Appendix 4.  \nc. Rent Change Requests Under  Special Circumstances (Mid -Year \nBudgets)  \n \nThe MFH Servicing Official may accept borrower requests for rent or utility allowance changes at times other than with the annual budget \nsubmission .  Under special circumstances if a change is necessary to \npreserve the financial integrity of a project a change request may be \nconsidered.  Such circumstances might be in the event of a natural \ndisaster , property transfer or when workout procedures and servicing \nactions  are necessary.   \n When a Plan II housing project is experiencing severe vacancies due to \nmarket conditions, the Agency may allow the borrower to charge a \nSpecial N ote Rent (SNR) that is less than N ote Rent but higher than \nBasic Rent, to attract or retain tenants whose income level would require \nthem to pay the SNR .  The requirements for receiving an SNR are \nestablished in Chapter 10 of HB-3-3560.  \nBoth of these situations would require a Mid-Year Budget be submitted to the Agency for approval. \n \nd. Approving Utility Allowances  \n \nAgency Staff must review the utility allowance documents submitted with \nthe budget to make sure that the numbers being used are reasonable and \ncomparable to other projects in the same market area.  In addition, the \nMFH  Servicing Official should check project budgets of any other \nAgency-funded projects in the area to see if utility allowances are similar.  \n \n________________________________________________________________________ ______  \n4-44 HB-2-3560  ",

Rent Changes for Units Receiving HUD Project -Based Section 8 \nAssistance [7 CFR 3560.207, and HUD \u2019s Section 8 Renewal Policy \nGuide  Book, Chapter 14] \n \nThe Agency has the responsibility to review and approve project budgets \non an annual basis based on need to meet cash flow and expense requirements.  Therefore, the MFH  Servic ing Official will not take into \naccount HUD\u2019s automatic annual adjustment for Section 8 contract rents.  The MFH  Servicing Official must approve only the rents needed to \nprovide sufficient income to meet approved project expenses.    The agreement in the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU ) between \nHUD and Rural Development indicates that the RD-approved budget will be submitted to HUD by the Project Owner and will serve as the basis for \nthe budget-based rent in the contract renewal process.  The rents at initial \nrenewal will be determined by the HUD staff, who will compare the RD-approved, budget-based rent as submitted by the Project Owner to the \ncurrent rents adjusted by an Operating Cost Adjustment Factor (OCAF) \nand will set the contra ct rent at the lesser of the two amounts.  HUD staff \nwill then notify both RD and the owner of the new contract rents.  Rent adjustment at subsequent renewals will be determined by OCAF unless the owner requests and HUD approves a budget-based increase that has \nbeen approved by RD\n. \n \nBorrowers must notify the Agency of any HUD rent changes. Since HUD- and Agency- approved rental rates frequently differ, it may be \nnecessary to have a 3-column budget in properties with HUD project-based Section 8 contracts. Refer to HB -2, Chapter 7, Exhibit 7-9 for \nrents applicable for each project type.  \n  When reviewing the budget, if the MFH Servicing Official concludes \nthat the HUD -authorized rent is more than what is needed to meet \nproject expenses (Basic Rent) , a lesser amount than the HUD rent \nmust be approved for Basic Rent .   \n \nIn accordance with Exhibit 4-5 Impact of Interest Credit Agreement \non Ability to Cancel Interest Credit, Collect Overage, and Deposit \nExcess Funds in the Reserve Account, when  the HUD contract rent \nexceed s Note Rate Rent, borrowers must deposit HUD funds equal to \nthe difference between the Agency approved Note Rate Rent and the HUD approved rent into the reserve account for the housing project.  The manager or borrower must use Form RD  3560-29, Notice of \nPayment Due Report (or MFIS Project Worksheet  (Report PRJ2000)), \nto document the extra required deposit in the reserve account.  The MFH  Servicing Official will monitor this deposit when reviewing the \nyear-end actuals.  \n If excess HUD rents accumulate in the reserve account beyond the fully funded level  shown in the borrower\u2019s loan agreement or \nresolution, the MFH Servicing Official may reduce or cancel the  \n________________________________________________________________________ ______  \n4-45 \n(07-19- 24)  PN 619  \n HB-2-3560  ",

Approval or Denial of Budgets \n \nOnce the budget analysis is complete, MFH  Servicing Officials  must \nnotify the borrower whether the budget has been approved or denied. \n a. Budget Approval  If a budget is received with reasonable operating expenses and a rent increase request to cover turnover costs and maintenance costs in line \nwith comparable properties, the Agency should not unreasonably withhold approval.  The MFH Servicing Official must consider the overall financial and physical health of the project.   When market conditions do not allow for sufficient rents to fund both operating and capital needs, the workout authorities of 7 CFR 3560, (\u00a7 3560.453) should be reviewed for their applica bility in the situation.  \n If the MFH  Servicing Official has determined that the budget \nrepresents reasonable costs and adequately addresses all outstanding compliance issues in the budget , the reserve account is current, and \nthe rent change (if requested) is acceptable, the budget may be approved.  To approve the budget, MFH  Servicing Officials  must \nacknowledge approval ( Form  RD 3560-7) in writing . The MFH  \nServicing Official must also enter the approval date in MFIS.  \nHandbook Letter 204(3560) will be sent notifying tenants of RD\u2019s  \napproval of the rent or utility allowance change at least 30 calendar \ndays prior to the effective date of the rent or utility allo wance change.  \n \nb. Automatic Budget Approval  \n \nIn the case of automatic approval, the MFH  Servicing Official must \nacknowledge approval of the proposed budget.  The MFH Servicing \nOfficial must complete the MFIS budget analysis, notify the borrower in writing, and update the Approval date in MFIS.   \n \nBudgets that are not reviewed within the 30- calendar day period are \nautomatically approved unless:  \n \n\u25ca The budget proposes a monthly rent increase above $25/month  per \nunit; or  \n \n\u25ca The b udget is submitted late or miss es other deadlines set by the \nAgency.  \n\u25ca Vacancy rates are above the allowable threshold.  \n \n\u25ca Property is under a workout plan or debt deferral. \n________________________________________________________________________ ______  \n4-48 HB-2-3560  ",

GENERAL  \n \nA. PURPOSE  \n \nThis guide is designed to assist independent public accountants (practitioners) in conducting agreed -upon procedures engagements of Rural  Rental  Housing (RRH) \nproperties financed by Rural Development. The RRH Program has a history of abuse involving the construction and ongoing operation of properties. This guide includes procedures to assist the practitioner in determining borrower and management company compliance with certain statutory, regulatory, and contr actual requirements \nof the RRH Program. Thus, practitioners need to be familiar with laws, regulations, and procedures related to the RRH Program. \n \nB. BACKGROUND  \n \nRural Development uses cost certifications to verify that borrowers spent loan funds for eligible and actual costs when constructing apartment complexes as part of the RRH Program.   RRH borrowers typically use identity -of-interest companies in both the construction \nof apartment complexes and in managing the day- to-day operations of RRH \nproperties. RRH borrowers that have an identity -of-interest with the borrower (general \ncontractor) a re required by Rural Development to report the actual costs of \nconstruction on Form RD 1924- 13, Estimate and Certificate of Actual Cost. In \naddition, Form RD 1924-13 must be submitted whenever there is an identity -of-\ninterest relationship between a borrower and a subcontractor, material supplier, or equipment lessor.  \n The USDA Office of Inspector General has performed audits and investigations that identified significant fraud and abuse in the RRH Program. Some of the fraud and \nabuse related to construction includes:   Ineligible, unsupported, and duplicate costs; \nmisrepresentation by borrowers of their roles as general contractors; shifting costs (e.g., overhead expenses) that exceeded budgeted amounts to different cost categories on Form RD 1924-13; and using identity- of-interest companies which are merely \n\u201cshell\u201d companies to either inflate legitimate charges or bill properties for costs that were never  incurred. \n Similar abuse using identity -of-interest companies has been identified in the ongoing \nmanagement of RRH properties. Borrowers and management companies also charge ineligible, unsupported, and duplicate expenses (generally for management related costs) to p roperties. Also, management companies frequently do not maintain suitable \nrecords when of properties, and overcharge for these services. Rural Development \nregulations refer to any scheme that improperly withdraws funds from RRH project accounts as \u201cequity skimming.\u201d",
  "page_213": " \n \n \nHB-2-3560  \nAttachment 4 -E \nPage 4 of 8  \n \n__________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n  \nUSDA Office of Inspector General audits have also identified instances of conflicts of \ninterest and a lack of independence on the part of certified and licensed public \naccountants when performing audits of RRH properties. Thus, practitioners should strictl y adhere to the standards and principles of the American Institute of Certified Public \nAccountants\u2019 Code of Conduct and Bylaws and applicable State Boards of Accountancy. \n \nC. PERTINENT REGULATIONS AND INSTRUCTIONS  \n \nConstruction Cost : \n \nThe instructions for Form RD 1924-13 provide guidance on eligible construction costs, \nas well as the required format for the presentation of costs. Rural Development has also established regulations that restrict the amount of builder\u2019s profit for each project, the use of identity -of-interest companies, and the business relationships of practitioners \nperforming engagements of RRH construction costs. The following regulations and Rural Development instructions should be used as guidance: \n\u2022 Rural Development Instruction 1924-A, and \n\u2022 Rural Development 7 CFR  3560. \n \nManagement of Ongoing Operations:  \n \nRural Development regulation 7 CFR 3560  provides details on allowable and \nunallowable operating costs, and places restrictions on the use of identity -of-interest \ncompanies and other activities related to managing RRH properties.  \n \nD. STANDARDS FOR CONDUCTING THE AGREED- UPON PROCEDURES \nENGAGEMENTS  \n \nPractitioners are to perform attestation engagements using agreed -upon procedures of \nconstruction costs and ongoing operations in accordance with attestation standards established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountant\u2019s (AICPA) and the standards applicable to attestation engagements contained in Government Auditing \nStandards issued by the Comptroller General of the United States.\u201d The practitioner\u2019s report on agreed- upon procedures should be in the form of procedures and findings.   (See \nexhibit A for an illustrative example.) \n \nIf practitioners become suspicious of fraud or illegal acts during the course of performing the agreed -upon procedures engagement, they are to promptly report these matters \n(regardless of materiality) to:  \nU.S. Department of Agriculture  \nRural Development  - Rural Housing Service  \nDirector, Multi-Family Housing Processing Division 1400  Independence Avenue , SW \nWashington, D.C.   20250  \nTelephone:  (202) 720-3773",

OBJECTIVES  \n \nThe objective of the construction cost engagement is to verify the propriety of costs reported on Form RD 1924-13. The practitioner should be alert for kickbacks on the \npurchase of services and materials, billings in excess of agreed -upon prices, billings \nfor non- existent materials or services, \u201csweetheart contracts,\u201d and the diversion of \nmaterials to other construction sites.  \n Of primary concern is compliance with general contractor and management company requirements and the role of identity -of-interest companies in the construction and \nmanagement of RRH properties. \n \nII. CONSTRUCTION COST ENGAGEMENTS  \n \nA. AGREED- UPON PROCEDURES FOR THE CONSTRUCTION COST \nATTESTATION ENGAGEMENT \n \nThe procedures in this section are designed to identify ineligible expenses and fictitious charges to Form RD 1924 -13.  Per 7 CFR 1924 subpart A and the \ninstructions for preparing Form RD 1924-13 provide guidance on eligible \nconstruction costs. \n \nBorrowers and contractors involved in the construction of Rural Development financed RRH properties are required to maintain recordkeeping systems which establish accounts that categorize costs in conformity with sections 1924.13 (e) (1) (v) (A) and 1924.13 (e) (2) (i) (H) of RD Instruction 1924- A. Form RD 1924-13 includes \na certification that the cost of labor, materials, and other necessary services incurred during construction are accurate and fairly presented. \n \nBorrowers are required to comply with laws, regulations, and Rural Development procedures related  to the construction of RRH  properties. USDA  Office  of \nInspector General audits have identified borrowers that received builder\u2019s profit for being the general contractor when, in fact, general contractor responsibilities were being performed by other contractors. The audits also disclosed that some identity- of-\ninterest companies were merely \u201cshell\u201d companies with no employees, inventory, or other business activities. Other identity -of-interest companies have charged rental fees \nfor equipment use for the entire construction period when the equipment was actually  \nused for short or intermittent periods during construction.  These actions  have resulted  in significant  amounts of overcharges to RRH \nproperties. Sections 1924.13 (e) (1) (v) (H) and 1924.13 (e) (2) (viii) of RD Instruction 1924- A prohibit borrowers from receiving builder\u2019s profit for ",

Examine  selected  checks,  invoices, job cost ledgers,  receiving  documentation, \netc., that support  costs presented  on Form  RD 1924- 13 to ensure  they were  \nactually incurred  to construct  the project.  (Note:  Verify  that checks have  \nbeen  cancelled and  ensure  that indirect costs  are not included  with the cost of \nlabor  and materials on Form  RD 1924- 13.)  \n3. Inspect selected checks held as retainage from subcontractors for evidence that they were actually paid by the bank. Confirmation with subcontractors may be necessary if cancelled checks are not available or not cancelled by the bank. (Note: Office of Insp ector General audits have disclosed instances where \nchecks were made to subcontractors, but never cashed.)  \n4. Compare  the address  on selected  delivery documents  and invoices  (using  the \nsample from  audit  step II.A.2.)  to the project\u2019s  address  to ascertain  whether  \nmaterials  and services  were  provided  to the project under  review.  (Note:  \nOffice  of Inspector  General  audits  have  disclosed  instances  where  delivery  \nwas not made  to the  RRH project  site.)  \n5. Examine selected cancelled checks related to accounts included in the \u201cto be paid\u201d column of Form RD 1924- 13 to determine the propriety of the costs \nreported. (Note: Office of Inspector General audits have disclosed instances where these costs were invoiced by identity -of-interest companies but  were \nnever actually paid by the  borrower.)  \n6. Confirm payments with selected subcontractors and material suppliers and investigate any discrepancies. (Note:  be alert for any discounts, rebates, or \nrefunds that were provided to the contractor but not included on Form RD  1924-\n13.) \n7. Inspect selected bid documentation to verify that the lowest bid submitted was accepted. If the lowest bid was not accepted, evaluate the justification for the higher bid.  If documentation does not exist, report this and the reason why as \na finding.  (Note:   be alert for \u201csweetheart contracts\u201d and contracts to disclosed \nor undisclosed identity -of-interest companies.)\n  \n8. Compare selected subcontractor billings (invoices) to contract amounts. If billings were in excess of contractual terms, ascertain the reason for the higher  \nexpenses.\n \n  ",

Determine if identity -of-interest companies meet Rural Development \nrequirements2 of providing services to the general  public.  \n \na. Question the general contractor/borrower about the business activities of any identity -of-interest company used and request evidence that the \ncompany provides services or materials to the general  public. \nb.

Compare equipment rental and supervision charges by identity- of-interest \ncompanies to independent rental companies to determine reasonableness3 of \ncharges. Report any significant  variances.  \n \na. Question the borrower about the use of equipment during construction and how rental rates were established and time of use determined.  \nb. Contact  an independent  rental company  to determine  commercial  rental \nrates and compare them  to the identity- of-interest charges.  \nc. Examine borrower documentation (e.g., commercial rate lists, time sheets, construction schedules, etc.) to support the rates that were used and time that was charged for equipment rental fees. (Note:  Office of \nInspector General audits have disclosed that borrowers are charging rental fees when equipment is not in use.)  \nd. Question the borrower about supervision charges.  \ne. Verify that the borrower has documentation (e.g., timesheets or timecards, travel reports, payroll records, etc.) to support supervision  \ncharges.\n  \n \n1Sections 1924.13 (e) (1) (v) (h) and 1924.13 (2) (2) (viii).  \n2Sections 1924.13 (e) (1) (I) and 1924.13 (2) (viii).  \n3A charge would be considered reasonable if it is approximately the same amount of cost that a non-identity -of-interest \ncompany would charge.",

If, for any \nreason, we are unable to complete the audit or are unable to form or have not formed an opinion, \nwe may decline to express an opinion or to issue a report as a result of this engagement. \n      \nThe report on internal control and compliance will include a statement that the report is intended \nfor the information and use of the partner, management, others within the organization and the \nUnited States Department of Agriculture Rural Development and is not intended to be and should \nnot be used by anyone other than these specified parties.  \nThe management of each Entity is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal \ncontrol and for compliance with the provisions of applicable laws, regulations, contracts, and \ngrant agreements.  In fulfilling this responsibility, estimates and judgments by management are \nrequired to assess the expected benefits and related costs of the controls. The objectives of \ninternal control are to provide management with reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that \nassets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorized use or disposition, that transactions are \nexecuted in accordance with management\u2019s authorizations and recorded properly to permit the \npreparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted \nin the Un ited States of America, and that Rural Development programs are managed in \ncompliance with applicable laws and regulations and the provisions of contracts and grant \nagreements.  \n \nIn planning and performing our audits, we will consider the internal control sufficient to plan each audit in order to determine the nature, timing, and extent of our auditing procedures for the \npurpose of expressing our opinions on the Entity\u2019s financial statements and on its compliance \nwith specific requirements applicable to its Rural Development programs and to report on the \ninternal control in accordance with the provisions of Government Auditing Standards and not to provide any assurance on the internal control. \n \nWe will obtain an understanding of the design of relevant controls and whether they have been \nplaced in operation, and we will assess control risk.

An audit is \nnot designed to provide assurance on internal control or to identify deficiencies in internal \ncontrol. However, during the audit, we will communicate to you, internal control related matters \nthat are required to be communicated under professional standards.  \n \nIdentifying and ensuring that each Entity complies with laws, regulations, contracts, and grant \nagreements is the responsibility of management. As part of obtaining reasonable assurance about \nwhether the financial statements are free of material misstateme nt, we will perform tests of each \nEntity\u2019s compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and the provisions of contracts and \nagreements, including grant agreements. However, the objective of those procedures will not be to provide an opinion on overall compliance,  and we will not express such an opinion. \n \nOur audits will be conducted in accordance with the standards referred to in the third paragraph. \nThose standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about \nwhether material non-compliance with the requirements described in the United States \nDepartment of Agriculture RD Handbook HB -2-3560 that are applicable to its Rural \nDevelopment programs occurred. The purpose of each audit will be to express an opinion on \neach Entity\u2019s compliance with specific requirements applicabl e to major programs listed in the \nprevious sentence. \n Our procedures will include tests of documentary evidence supporting the transactions recorded \nin the account, and may include direct confirmation of cash, investments, loan balances, and \ncertain other assets and liabilities by correspondence with certain individuals, creditors and \nfinancial institutions. We may also request written representations from your attorneys as part of \neach engagement, and they may bill you for responding to that inquiry. At the conclusion of each \nengagement, we will require a wri tten representation letter from the owner and or management of \neach specific Entity that, among other things, will confirm management\u2019s responsibility for the presentation of the financial statements. \n \nAn audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in \nthe financial statements; therefore, our audits will involve judgment about the number of \ntransactions to be examined and the areas to be tested.

We \nconducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and the standards applicable to financial audits contained in Government \nAuditing Standards , issued by the Comptroller General of the United States. Those standards \nrequire that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.  \n \nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor\u2019s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to Partnership\u2019s preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in order to design audit procedures that a re appropriate in the circumstances, but not \nfor the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of Partnership\u2019s internal control. Accordingly, we express no such opinion. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting polic ies used and the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by \nmanagement, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.  \nWe believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. \n ",

The community is financed by a United States Department of Agriculture \nRural Development (RD) Section 515 Loan, and therefore is regulated by RD as to rent charges and operating methods. Under this program, Partnership provides housing to low -income and moderate -income \nfamilies, su bject to regulation by RD as to rental charges and operating methods. Lower rental charges to \ntenants are recovered by Partnership through rental and interest subsidies provided by RD.  \nNote 2 \u2013 Significant Accounting Policies  \nA summary of Partnership\u2019s significant accounting policies consistently applied in the preparation of the accompanying financial statements is as follows:  \nBasis of Accounting  \nPartnership\u2019s financial statements were prepared on the accrual basis of accounting.  \n \nUse of Estimates  \nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the \nUnited States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of continent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, and other changes in partners\u2019 capital (deficit) during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.   \nCash and Cash Equivalents  \nFor the statements of cash flows, all unrestricted investment instruments with original maturities of three months or less are cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 20X2 and 20X1, cash and cash equivalents consist of an operating checking account.  \n \nSubsequent Events  \nPartnership evaluated subsequent events through March XX, 20X3, which is the date the financial statements were available to be issued. This evaluation determined that there are no subsequent events that necessitated further disclosure in and/or adjustment s to the accompanying financial statements.  \n \n  ",

Tenants who are evicted or move out are charged with damages or cleaning fees, if applicable. Tenant receivable consists of amounts due for rental income, \nsecurity deposits, or th e charges for damages and cleaning fees. Partnership does not accrue interest on the tenant \nreceivable balances.    \n \nPartnership has not established an allowance for doubtful accounts and does not use the reserve method for recognizing bad debts. Bad debts are treated as direct write- offs in the period management determines that collection \nis not probable.  \nTenant Security Deposits  \nPartnership maintains accounts for security deposits received from tenants. The cash is restricted for reimbursement of the security deposits unless there is evidence of default by a tenant under the lease agreement.   \nTax and Insurance Reserve  \nTax and insurance reserve is restricted cash for payments of real estate taxes and insurance. Partnership is required to establish and maintain a reserve account. This account is used to receive monthly deposits sufficient to pay annual real estate taxes and insurance premiums that are paid from the account.   \nReplacement Reserves  \nIn accordance with the loan agreement with RD, a reserve for replacement is to be funded $AMT annually until it reaches $AMT.  \n \nProperty and Equipment  \nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation is computed using the straight -line method of \ndepreciation. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and any resulting gain or loss is recognized as income or loss for the period. The cost of maintenance and repairs is charged to expense as incurred and significant renewal and betterments are capitalized. \nDeductions are made for retirements resulting from renewals o r betterments.  \n \nAccrued Real Estate Taxes  \nPartnership is subject to real estate and personal property taxes and pays one year in arrears. Partnership was assessed \nin 20X1 and made bi -annual payments in May 20X2 and November 20X2. Failure to make these payments could \nhave resulted in additional penalties, interest, and liens. At December 31, 20X2 and 20X1, accrued real estate taxes represent an estimated amount to be paid in the subsequent year.  \n \nRecognition of Rent Revenue  \nPartnership recognized net rent revenue in the period in which the rent is earned. In accordance with the RD financial reporting requirements, potential rental income represents total possible rent revenue as if all units are 100  percent  \noccupied during the year. Total rental income represents potential rental income less vacancies. Rents collected in advance are deferred until the rental income is earned.  \n  ",

For the years ended December 31, 20X2 and 20X1, \nadvertising and marketing expenses were $AMT and $AMT, respectively.  \n \nIncome Taxes  \nNo provision for federal or state income taxes was made in the financial statements as the federal and state \nincome tax effect on Partnership\u2019s activities accrued to its partners.  \n \nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States require Partnership to examine its tax positions for uncertain positions. Partnership is not aware of any tax positions that are more likely than not to change \nin the next twelve months, or that  would not sustain an examination by applicable taxing authorities. \nPartnership\u2019s policy is to recognize penalties and interest as incurred in its statements of income (loss) as a component of operating expenses, and totaled $0 for December 31, 20X2 and 20X1. Partnership\u2019s federal and state income tax returns for fiscal years ended 20XX through 20XX are subject to examination by the \napplicable tax authorities, generally for three years after the later of the original or extended due date.  \n \nImpairment of Long -Lived Assets  \n \nIn accordance with the provisions of accounting for the impairment or disposal of long- lived assets, \nPartnership reviews long -lived assets for impairments when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of \nan asset may not be recoverable based on the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset. If the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, a write- down to fair value is recorded. Fair values are determined \nbased on the discounted cash flows, quoted market values, or external appraisals, as appli cable. Long- lived \nassets are reviewed for impairment at the individual asset or the asset group level for which the lowest level of independent cash flows can be identified.  \n \nFair Value Measurements  \n \nPartnership adopted fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities of non -financial \nitems that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. This \nestablishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or \nliabilities (Level 1 measurements) and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant \nunobservable inputs (Level 3 measurements).The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:  \n\u2022  Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that \nPartnership has the ability to access at the measurement date.  \n\u2022 Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the \nasset or liability, either directly or indirectly.  \n\u2022  Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. \n \n \n  ",

Partnership had no investments at December 31, 20X2 and 20X1 e xcept for certificate of deposits.  \n \nPartnership operates in a heavily regulated environment that typically includes restrictions such as land use, rent regulations, government subsidies in the form of rental assistance through either rent subsidy or tenant vouchers, subsidized mortgage interest rates, and restrictions on selling or transferring.  \nA summary of the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair values of financial instruments is as \nfollows:  \n\u2022  Short -term financial instruments \u2013 The fair value of short- term financial instruments, including cash and \ncash equivalents, restricted deposits, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate their carrying value due to the short -term nature of these instruments.  \n\u2022  Long- term financial instruments \u2013 The fair value of long -term financial instruments, including mortgage \npayable which approximates the carrying value in the accompanying financial statements based on current borrowing rates.  \n \nReclassifications  \nCertain accounts in the 20X1 financial statements were reclassified for comparative purposes to conform with the presentation in the 20X2 financial statements. Total assets, liabilities, partners\u2019 capital (deficits), and net income are unchanged due to the se reclassifications.  \n \nNote 3 \u2013 Mortgage Payable  \nThe mortgage payable is payable to RD in monthly installments of $AMT at an interest rate of RATE% per annum \nand a term of # years, maturing on DATE. As part of the Loan Agreement, Partnership entered into an Interest Credit \nand Rental Assistance Agreement that effectively lowers the interest rate to approximately 1  percent  over the term of \nthe loan. The mortgage liability of Partnership is limited to the underlying value of the real estate collateral pledged. \nNo partner is personally liable on the mortgage note payable. The original amount of the note payable was $AMT.  \n \nEstimated annual maturities of the mortgage notes payable are as follows:  \n \n20X3  $ AMT  \n20X4  AMT  \n20X5  AMT  \n20X6  AMT  \n20X7  AMT  \nThereafter  AMT  \n  $ AMT  \n ",

Partnership\u2019s operations are concentrated in the affordable housing real estate market. In addition, Partnership operates in a heavily regulated environment. The operations of \nPartnership are subject to the administrative directives, rules, and regulations of federal, state, and local regulatory \nagencies, including, but not limited to, RD and the State Housing Agency. Such administrative directives, rules, and regulations are subject to change by an act of Congres s or an administrative change mandated by RD or the \nState Housing Agency. Such changes may occur with little adequate funding to pay for the related cost, including the additional administrative burden, to comply with a change.  \n \nConcentration in Government Funding  \nPartnership received X percent  and X  percent of gross revenue from RD in the form of rental assistance and interest \nreduction subsidy payments during the years ended December 31, 20X2 and 20X1, respectively.  \n \nConcentration in Credit Risk \nPartnership continually monitors its positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions with which it invests. Financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentration of credit risk consist principally of cash. Management believes Partnership placed all cash with high -credit quality financial institutions and that \nthere is no significant concentration of credit risk with respect to cash. ",

The Return To Owner guidance is found in HB -2-3560, \nChapter 4, Section 2, Paragraph 4.4 B and guidance for the non -profit asset management fee is found in HB -2-\n3560, Chapter 4, Section 4, Paragraph 4.14 B 1, 4th bullet point.     \n6. \uf06f Yes \uf06f No  Was insurance maintained with Agency requirements?  They should mark that the \nborrower has maintained at least the Liability and Property Insurance but could have other insurance as \nwell.  They should have Fidelity Insurance unless the loan is to an individual or general partnership and they are \nmanaging the property and responsible for the financial activities.   If they do not have Liability or Property \nInsurance (or earthquake or flood and you know they should), provide them with HB -2-3560, Chapter 3, Section \n4.

If MFIS is missing anyone, check the organizational documents that we \nhave on file and update MFIS if we know they are part of the organization.   If the borrower made a change without \nour knowledge, provide them HB -3-3560, Chapter 5 and ask that they provide us proper documentation of the \nchange.

If it is not or they indicate taxes are not current, follow- up with the borrower on why and \nprovide them HB -2-3560, Chapter 3, Section 4, Paragraph 3.20 as guidance.   It is extremely important that you \ncontinue to follow -up with the borrower to bring the taxes current.

Do not put nondescriptive comments like \u201cOkay\u201d or \u201cDone\u201d, you need to \nprovide an explanation .  The MFIS Analysis is a tool to help you review the yearend actuals, but you still need to do \na thorough review of the financials yourself.   \n\uf06f All property  expenses need to conform with Attachment 4- C Allowable and Unallowable Project Expenses.

They are governed by their articles of \nincorporation and bylaws.  Nearly every corporation has a board of directors, which is charged with managing the business \naffairs of the corporation as provided in the bylaws.  Under limited circumstances, a shareholder agreement can eliminate \nthe board of directors and transfer the exercise of corporate powers directly to the shareholders.   Officers are appointed b y \nthe board of directors, in accordance with the  bylaws, and the same person may hold multiple officers. Officers have the \nauthority to perform the duties described by the bylaws. In all circumstances signature authority is governed by the articles  \nof incorporation and bylaws.  \nGeneral Partnership:   A  g eneral partnership is a business arrangement by which two or more individuals agree to share in all \nassets, profits, and financial and legal liabilities of a jointly owned business.  In a general partnership, partners agree t o \nunlimited liability, meaning liabilities are not capped and can be paid through the seizure of an owner's assets.  Furthermore, \nany partner may be sued for the business's debts.  Typically, these are \u201colder\u201d formed partnerships.  \nLimited Liability Company (LLC):    A limited liability company is made up of member(s) and/or manager(s).  Management of an \nLLC is generally vested in managers, as provided by the operating agreement. Non -managers of an LLC are called \"members.\"  \nLLCs are governed by articles of organization, which may provide regulations governing the company\u2019s internal affairs, but the LLC may also have an operating agreement, which may further provide limitations or authorizations possessed by the \nmembers or managers.  Generally, if the articles of organization provide for management of the LLC in the managers, then \nthe managers are the only agents of the LLC for ordinary business purposes, and the members may not act as an agent of the HB-2-3560  \nAttachment 4 -P \nPage 5 of  6 \n \n____________________________________________________________________________________________  \nINTENDED FOR USE BY RD STAFF ONLY  \n (07-19-24)  PN 619 \n ",

In an LLC members and managers are not liable for the LLCs debts, and members and managers cannot be held \npersonally liable in court for an obligation of the LLC.   \nLimited Liability Limited Partnership (LLLP):   A limited liability limited partnership (LLLP) is a type of partnership which combines \nthe limited liability of an LLP with the two -tiered governance of a Limited Partnership .   Regarding the ability to sign \ndocuments and bind the partnership, an LLLP is governed just as a Limited Partnership.  \nLimited Liability Partnership (LLP):    A limited liability partnership (LLP) is a type of partnership where all partners have limited \nliability. All partners can also partake in management activities. This is unlike a limited partnership, where at least one \ngeneral partner must have unlimited liability and limited partners  cannot be part of management.  \nLimited Partnership (LP):   A li m ited partnership (LP) is a type of partnership made up of two or more partners (general \npartner(s) and limited partner(s)).   The general partner oversees and runs the business while limited partners  do not \npartake in managing the business. However, the general partner has unlimited liability for the debt, and any limited partners  \nhave limited liability up to the amount of their investment.  \nPartnership Asset Management Fee (Asset Management Fee):    A fee, stated in the Limited Partnership Agreement or \nPartnership Agreement, which is paid for managing the affairs of the partnership.  As noted in HB -2-3560, Chapter 4.14 B., \n\u201cAny investor asset management fee, investor service fee, or similar fee may  be paid solely from the annual Return to Owner \nand may not be paid from property operating funds.

  "page_315": "HB-2-3560 \n \n5.1   INTRODUCTION  \nThe existing portfolio of multi- family housing projects constitutes a major asset of the \nGovernment and the Agency, but the value of this asset depends upon the quality of its upkeep.  \nThis chapter describes the responsibilities of borrowers to maintain the physical condition of the project and of the Agency to exercise appropriate oversight of these responsibilities.  The chapter describes the components of adequate physical maintenance, the role of the management plan, and the performance of a physical inspection of the project.  \nSECTION 1:  PROJECT MAINTENANCE [7 CFR 3560. 103]  \n5.2   PURPOSE  \nThe Agency has issued performance standards that describe the physical condition of a \nproperly managed project.  The Agency\u2019s interest in protecting the physical condition of projects that it has financed include s: \n\u2022 Providing decent, safe, and sanitary affordable housing to the occupants;  \n\u2022 Protecting and enhancing the security of its investment; and  \n\u2022 Assuring compliance with all applicable State and local laws.  \n5.3   MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS AND STANDARDS OF PHYSICAL CONDITIONS  \nA.  Standards of Physical Conditions  \nBorrowers are responsible for the long -term, cost -effective preservation of the \nhousing project.  The Agency has specified two types of requirements borrowers must meet:  \n\u2022 Performance standards for the project; and  \n\u2022 Procedures and systems that property managers must design and follow. \nB.  Performance Standards  \nThe regulations in 7 CFR 3560.103(a)(3) specify the performance standards for \nmeeting acceptable physical conditions.  The performance standards describe the characteristics the Agency expects to see in a particular component or system, for example:  CHAPTER 5:  PROJECT PHYSICAL CONDITIONS  \n5-1 \n(07-19-24)  PN 619 \n  ",
  "page_316": "HB-2-3560 \n\u201cThe housing project must have a foundation that is free of evidence of \nstructural failure, such as uneven settlement indicated by horizontal cracks or severe bowing of the foundation wall.  Structural members must not have evidence of rot or insect or rodent infestation.  \nThe housing project must have a roof that is free of leaks, defective covering, curled or missing shingles and which is not sagging or buckling.\u201d  \nThe performance standards have been incorporated into a physical inspection form to \nbe completed by Agency staff during a site visit.  They also have been incorporated into the certifications that accompany the management agreement for the project.  \nThe standards include the following major categories:  \n\u2022 Standards that apply to the site on which the project is located;  \n\u2022 Standards that apply to the exterior maintenance of the building and of the common areas;  \n\u2022 Standards that apply to the interior of the building or buildings; and  \n\u2022 Standards that apply to common areas, such as hallways or elevators.  \nC.  Maintenance Systems and Procedures  \nEffective maintenance is partly the result of regular routines and partly the result of \npromptly fixing small problems before they become major ones.  Proper maintenance has a direct effect on the tenants\u2019 perception of the quality of the housing project.  Therefore, the Agency requires borrowers to institute a number of systems and procedures that the borrower must describe in the project\u2019s management plan.  The requirements for a management plan are described in Chapter 3.  \nSeveral systems are part of a sound management program:  \n\u2022 Preventive maintenance.   Most maintenance work can be predicted and scheduled \u2014\nthis is typically described as preventive maintenance.  The Agency requires managers to spell out procedures for scheduling routine tasks, such as garbage and trash \nremoval, snow and ice removal, grounds upkeep, routine painting, and minor repairs.  \nProcedures are also required for the routine maintenance of equipment consistent with \nservice information provided by the manufacturer \u2014biweekly or monthly routine \noiling, adjusting, re placement of filters, safety checks of alarms, and outside lighting, \netc. \n\u2022 Response to calls.   Good upkeep requires a speedy response to complaints or \nunforeseen problems.  The Agency requires managers to establish a system for responding to tenant complaints or to unexpected malfunctions or damage, such as leaks, broken windows, etc.  \n5-2 \n  ",
  "page_317": "HB-2-3560 \n\u2022 Work orders.   Managers must know what has happened from the time a complaint \nhas been received or a problem has been noted, to an inspection confirming the \ncondition has been corrected.  The Agency requires the project to have a work- order \nsystem that tracks the date a complaint is received, the inspection to verify the complaint, a report describing the required repair or corrective action, the assignment of the repair, the completion report, and final inspection noting satisfactory completion of the work.  \n\u2022 Inspections.   Frequent, regular inspections are a major component of an effective \nmaintenance system.  The Agency requires management, at a minimum, to perform an annual inspection of each occupied unit and to inspect each unit at move -in and \nmove -out.  Inspecting a unit with the tenant at move -in and move -out establishes the \ncondition of the unit at the time the tenant takes possession, and may help clarify responsibility for any damages that have occurred in the unit during the occupancy period.  \n\u2022 Energy conservation.  Energy conservation efforts are an ongoing responsibility of \nproject management.  The Agency requires managers to establish effective systems to reduce energy consumption.  These may include energy audits to determine cost -\neffective techniques of energy conservation, energy- efficient lighting, water- saving \nfixtures, low -flow toilets, energy -efficient appliances, insulation, caulking and \nweather -stripping, storm doors and windows, and regular cleaning and replacement of \nfilters and othe r equipment.  \n\u2022 Tenant damages.  The Agency requires management to establish a policy and \nimplement a system to obtain reimbursement for damage caused by the tenant to the property beyond normal wear and tear.  The policy is to be stated in the tenant\u2019s lease as described in  Chapter 6 of this Handbook. \n\u2022 Accessibility issues.  The Agency requires the borrower and/or management to establish a policy regarding project and unit accessibility for applicants, tenants, and employees in accordance with applicable civil rights legislation.  \n\u25ca In projects that were ready for occupancy on or before January 26, 1993, when \npublic areas are altered, they must be altered to Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADA/AG) standards.  (Public areas are those areas used by individuals other than tenants and their guests.  This includes offices used to \npay bills or to inquire about service or employment, public restrooms, and \nbuildings used for voting or public meetings.)  \n\u25ca In projects that were ready for occupancy after January 26, 1993, public areas \nmust be designed and constructed to ADA/AG standards.  \n\u25ca In accordance with the Fair Housing Act, in Multi -Family Housing projects that \nwere ready for occupancy on or before March 31, 1991, FHA/AG architectural \nrequirements do not apply, even during project rehabilitation.  \n5-3 \n(07-19-24)  PN 619 ",

  "page_319": "HB-2-3560 \n5.4 CORRECTING DEFICIENCIES  \nThere are a number of ways in which the need for maintenance is identified:  \n\u2022 Management staff may uncover, anticipate, or expect such maintenance;  \n\u2022 Tenants may make complaints; and   \n\u2022 Agency staff may identify defects in the course of a site visit.  \nNo matter how the problem was identified, the borrower is responsible for  \ncorrecting it.  \nThe borrower is responsible for adequate maintenance and upkeep of the project that \ncomplies with Agency performance standards.  The Agency understands, however, that property \nmaintenance is an ongoing process and that there may be instances when diligent borrowers are temporarily unable to achieve 100 percent compliance with Agency standards.  In such instances, the Agency will not penalize borrowers \u2014as long as it is evident that the borrower is actively \nstriving to return to full compliance, as soon as po ssible (see the standards listed in \n7 CFR 3560.103).   \nThis flexibility is not  extended to projects where the deficiencies are so extensive that the \nproperty would be declared in substantial noncompliance.  In these instances, the projects\u2019 viability is called into question, as well as the effectiveness of the management\u2019s maintenan ce \nprogram.  The Agency should coordinate with and or report to  State and local inspection \nauthorities, where applicable, when health and safety issues exist at a property.  \nThe borrower shall immediately inform the Agency of any deficiency for which \ncorrection requires repairs that cannot be paid out of project operating funds and immediately initiate procedures to access project reserves (see Chapter 4 of this Handbook).  Th e Agency will \nin turn provide the borrower with a timeframe for completing the repairs.  If the borrower cannot meet the Agency required timeframe, then they must provide documentation and justification why they cannot meet such a timeframe.   \n \n    \n \n \n5-5 \n(07-19-24)  PN 619 \n  ",

Capital expenditures are addressed as long- term improvements \non the front of the operating budget.  \nChapter 4 of this Handbook describes the process for accessing the reserve account to pay for major capital improvements.\nRule -of-Thumb  \nA capital expenditure is typically defined \nas an expenditure on an item for which the \nuseful life is greater than one year.  For \nexample:  \n\u2022Repaving the parking lot is a capital cost; fixing a pothole is an operating cost.  \n\u2022Repainting the exterior of the entire \nproject is a capital expenditure; \nrepainting units on a routine basis is \nconsidered routine maintenance.  \n5-6 \n  ",
  "page_321": "HB-2-3560 \nSECTION 2: CAPITAL PLANNING  \n5.6   OVERVIEW  \nThis section describes how borrowers, with assistance from Agency staff, can plan for \nmajor capital expenses and how to pay for them.  This type of planning can take many forms.  \nThe two most common forms used by the Agency are an annual capital expenditure budget and a capital needs assessment.  Refer to Chapter 4 of this Handbook for preparation of an annual capital expenditure budget.  \n5.7   CAPITAL NEEDS ASSESSMENT \nA.  Overview  \nA capital needs assessment (CNA) identifies the immediate and future capital needs \nof a project.  It is based on a physical inspection and a life -cycle analysis of a project\u2019s \nmajor building components systems, equipment, and exterior amenities, such as the site \nlighting and parking lots.  The CNA includes a replacement schedule that anticipates the \nuseful life of each item, and estimates when they will need to be replaced and the cost.  Preparation of a CNA is an eligible project expense.  \nB.  General Criteria:  \n\u2022 A capital needs assessment should be prepared at a reasonable cost by an individual or firm with professional experience in multi -family housing design, construction, \ncost estimating or similar qualification.  \n\u2022 The C NA should be prepared in accordance with generally accepted industry \npractices.  \n\u2022 The assessment should include the detailed items listed on the Form RD 3560- 11 \nMulti -family Housing Physical Inspection Report.  The assessment time period \nshould be between 10 and 20 years.   \n\u2022 The estimated repair and replacement costs and estimated useful life spans for the components should be based on data from a nationally recognized source, such as RS Means \u201cRepair and Remodeling Cost Data\u201d a nd Marshall and Swift \u201cResidential Cost \nHandbook\u201d.  \nC.  Determining a Project\u2019s Capital Needs \nThe amount required for deposit into the replacement reserve account is established \nfor new projects during the loan origination phase, based in part on a life -cycle cost \nanalysis of selected materials going into the project (see 7 CFR 3560.65).  For infor mation on conducting life -cycle analyses, refer to Chapter 3 of HB -1-3560. \nFor existing projects, the Agency may require the development of a capital needs \nassessment in the following circumstances:  \n5-7 \n(07-19-24)  PN 619 ",

Agency procedures \nfor ensuring borrower compliance are summarized at the end of the chapter.  \nSECTION 1:  TENANT ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS [7 CFR 3560.152]  \n6.2 GENERAL ELIGIBILITY\u2014INCOME ELIGIBILITY \nTo be admitted to multi -family housing, applicants must meet basic requirements. \n\u2022 Have income that does not exceed the limits defined by the Agency;  \n\u2022 Meet the program definition of an eligible household. \nA borrower may determine an applicant ineligible for occupancy based on screening criteria \nother than those required by the Agency only if such criteria are included in the project\u2019s management plan.  The screening criteria may not contain arbitrary or dis criminatory rejection \ncriteria but  may consider an applicant\u2019s past rental and credit history and relations with other \ntenants.  \n6.3 INCOME REQUIREMENTS  \nThree different income limits are used to establish eligibility for Multi -Family Housing \nprograms.  The Agency determines the income limits and updates the limits whenever they are \nrevised.  Adjusted income  should be compared with the below- listed income limits to determine \nthe category in which each household falls: \n\u2022 The very low- income limit is established at the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment (HUD) very low- income limit (generally  50 percent of the median income \nfor the area, adjusted for household size ); \n\u2022 The low- income limit is established at the HUD low- income limit (generally 80 percent \nof the median income for the area, adjusted for household size); and \n\u2022 The moderate- income limit is greater than the HUD established low- income limit but \ndoes not exceed the low- income limit by more than $5,500 for each household size. \nThe borrower has the right to determine a minimum income level for households of various \nsizes for applicants who will not be receiving rental assistance.  These guidelines must be administered consistently for all potential applicants.   \n6-1 ",

The word \u201chousehold\u201d applies to individuals and family members who intend to live in a \nunit. \nA.  Defining a Household \nA household is defined as the tenant or co-tenant and the persons or dependents living \nwith a tenant or co -tenant but not including a resident assistant (or live in aide).  Deciding \nwho can be considered a household member affects many decisions the borrower must make, including:  \n\u2022 The number of bedrooms the family needs; \n\u2022 The members\u2019 income that must be counted and the income limits that should be used; \n\u2022 The extent to which the family qualifies for certain income deductions and certain \npreferences; and  \n\u2022 The household member who can sign legal documents. \nB.  Who Can Be Counted as a Household Member?  \nA household may be made up of a variety of members and may have a specific definition.  \nIf a household member cannot be included when making the determination of household size \nfor income limit purposes or for unit size determination, it will be noted below in the definitions .  The following are definitions of members and types:  \n\u2022 Dependent:   A dependent is a member of the family (which excludes foster children \nand foster adults) other than the family head or spouse who is under 18 years of age, or is a person with a disability, or is a full -time student.  \n\u2022 Elderly household:   A household where the tenant or co- tenant (for cooperative \nhousing the member or co- member) is at least 62 years old, or a person with \ndisabilities, as defined below.  An elderly family may include a person younger than 62 years of age.  To receive an elderly family deduction, the person who is elderly, or disabled must be the tenant or co -tenant (for cooperative housing the member or co -\nmember).    \n\u2022 Foster adult.   A foster adult is 18 years of age or older and meets the definition of a \nfoster adult under State law.  They are generally unable to live independently due to a debilitating physical or mental condition.   \n6-2 ",

Eligible families may include foster \nchildren, or State or Tribal kinship living in the household, as long as they do not cause overcrowding.   \no Foster children, State or Tribal kinship are included as household members to \ndetermine the appropriate  unit size.   \no Anticipated expenses for childcare for foster children under age 13  may be \ndeducted from annual income if all other criteria for childcare deduction are met.  \no Foster children, State or Tribal kinship are not included as household members for \nthe purposes of determining income, or deductions from income ( disability \nexpenses or medical expenses) , or to determine household size for income limit \neligibility . \no When a member  of the household is temporarily placed in foster care (as \nconfirmed by the state child welfare agency) the member is still counted as a household member in the unit from which they are removed. \n\u2022 Person  with Disabilities:  The term disability is considered equivalent to the term \nhandicap.  A person is considered to have a disability if either of the following two situations occur:  \n(1) As defined in section 501(b) of the Housing Act of 1949.  The person is the head \nof household (or his or her spouse) and is determined to have an impairment which: \n(i) Is expected to be of long continued and indefinite duration; \n(ii) Substantially impedes the person\u2019s ability to live independently; and  \n(iii) Is of such a nature that such ability could be improved by more suitable housing conditions, or if such person has a developmental disability as defined in section 102(7) of the Developmental Disability and Bill of Rights Act (42 U.S.C. 6001(7)). \n (2) As defined in the Fair Housing Act; the Americans with Disabilities Act; and \nsection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.  The person has a physical or mental \nimpairment which substantially limits one or more of such person's major life activities; a record of such impairment; or being regarded as having such an impairment.

The term \"physical or mental impairment\" includes, but is not limited to, such diseases and con ditions as orthopedic, visual, speech and hearing impairments, \ncerebral palsy, autism, epilepsy, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis, cancer, heart disease, diabetes, Human Immunodeficiency Virus infection, mental retardation, emotional illness, drug addiction (other than addiction caused by current, illegal use of a controlled substance), and alcoholism; \n(iii) Major life activities means functions such as caring for oneself , performing \nmanual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, breathing, learning, and \nworking; \n(iv) Has a record of such an impairment means has a history of, or has been \nmisclassified as having, a mental or physical impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities;  \n(v)  Is regarded as having an impairment means: \n(A)  Has a physical or mental impairment that does not substantially limit one or more major life activities but that is treated by the borrower or management agent as constituting such a limitation;  \n(B)  Has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities only as a result of the attitudes of others toward such impairment; or  \n(C)  Has none of the impairments described in this definition but is treated by another person as having such an impairment. \n\u2022 Remaining family members.   Remaining members of resident families are family \nmembers who stay in a unit after other members of the household leave.  These members will be reevaluated for eligibility in accordance with Section 7 of this chapter.  Agency regulations may require remaining tenants to move to a unit of appropriate size or exit the project.  \n\u2022 Resident assistant  (or live -in aid e).  A person residing in a tenant\u2019s housing unit \nwho is essential to the well -being and care of the persons who are elderly or have \ndisabilities residing in the unit but is not obligated for the person\u2019s financial support \n6-4 ",

A resident assistant may function in any type of housing affected by this section.  A resident assistant\u2019s income is not included in the household\u2019s determination of annual income.  The resident assistant is counted as an occupant to determine unit size.  \n\u2022 Student.   A student may be considered an eligible tenant when all of the following \nconditions are met: \no The student is of legal age in accordance with the applicable state law or is \notherwise legally able to enter into a binding contract under state law;  \no The person seeking occupancy:  \n(1) must meet the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s definition of an \nindependent or must have  established a household separate from the person\u2019s \nparents or legal guardians (for at least one year prior to application for \noccupancy), and is no longer claimed as a dependent by the person\u2019s parents or legal guardians pursuant to Internal Revenue Service regulations, and evidence (most recently filed tax return) is provided to this effect; or  \n(2) is claimed as a dependent by the person\u2019s parents or legal guardians \nand the student is eligible because the entire household is income eligible.  \nIf eligible under item (1) above, the applicant must sign a written statement indicating whether or not the person\u2019s parents, legal guardians, or others provide any financial assistance, and this financial assistance is considered as part of current annual income \nand is verified in writing by the borrower. \n\u2022 Unborn child(ren) .  An unborn child(ren) is included as a household member for \ndeterm ining unit size and household size for  income limit purposes.  However, a \nhousehold cannot receive a dependent deduction for an unborn child. The same rules apply for a household that has been approved to adopt a child(ren).  \n6.6 ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ELDERLY HOUSING, CONGREGATE \nHOUSING, AND GROUP HOMES  \nIn addition to the requirements listed in Paragraph 6.2, applicants for elderly housing, \ncongregate housing, or group homes must meet the additional requirements described below. \nA.

Group Homes \nTo be admitted to a group home: \n\u2022 Applicants/tenants must need  the special services provided by the group home. \n\u2022 Applicants must demonstrate a need for such housing and cannot be required to be a \npart of an ongoing training or rehabilitation program. \n\u2022 Applicants must be selected from the market area prior to considering applicants from \nother areas.  \nA group home may limit occupancy to a specific group of tenants (e.g., eligible elderly \ntenants, developmentally disabled or mentally impaired tenants) if it is outlined in the \nborrower\u2019s management plan.  \n6.7 INELIGIBLE TENANT WAIVERS  \nThe Agency may authorize the borrower in writing, upon receiving the borrower\u2019s \nwritten request with the necessary documentation, to rent vacant units to ineligible persons for temporary periods to protect the financial interest of the Government.  Such ineligible \ntenant waiver (s) could include households that are over income, over housed or under housed \n(this list is not all inclusive).  Likewise, this provision may extend to a cooperative.  This authority will be for the entire project for periods not to exceed one year.  Within the period \nof the lease, the tenant may not be required to move to allow an eligible applicant to obtain occupancy, should one become available. Age restrictions may not be waived.  The Agency \nmust make the following determinations:  \n\u2022 There are no eligible persons on a waiting list.  \n\u2022 The borrower provided documentation that a diligent but unsuccessful effort to rent any vacant units to an eligible tenant household has been made.  Such documentation may consist of advertisements in appropriate publications, posting notices in public places, and in other places where persons seeking rental housing would likely make contact; holding open houses; and making appropriate contacts with public housing agencies and organizations, Chambers of Commerce, and real estate agencies.  The borrower agre es to continue with aggressive efforts to locate eligible tenants and \nretain documentation of all marketing.  \n\u2022 The borrower agrees to publish a notice in the local newspaper to inform the public of the borrower\u2019s intent to temporarily rent apartments to all persons without regard to income restrictions.    \n6-6 ",

Agency staff can refer to the Multi -Family \nInformation S ystems Project Details screen to determine Plan type.  \n \nSECTION 2: CALCULATING INCOME AND INITIAL CERTIFICATION  \n6.8 BORROWER AND APPLICANT/TENANT RESPONSIBILITY  \nBorrowers of all Rural Rental Housing properties must verify and document in the tenant\u2019s \nfile all income, assets, expenses, deductions, family characteristics, and any other factors that \naffect family eligibility or level of assistance.  This requirement excludes those residents of On Farm Labor Housing who are living in housing provided on a non- rental basis.  With USDA \nguidance the borrower should develop verification and documentation procedures for the properties they manage and ensure that on- site pro perty staff responsible for these functions are \ntrained to understand and properly implement these procedures. Effective and efficient borrower, management agent, and property staff performance in this area is fundamental to obtaining the correct information needed for accurate rent determinations and assistance payments.  The following are essential procedures to reduce the incidence of improper reporting. \n\u2022 Applicants/tenants and their adult family members \nmust sign consent forms to authorize the borrower to \ncollect information to verify eligibility, income, \nassets, expenses, and deductions.  Applicants and \ntenants who do not sign required consent forms will not receive assistance.   \n\u2022 Family members 6 years of age and older must \nprovide the borrower with a complete and accurate \nsocial security number.  For any members of the family who do not have a social security number, the applicant or family member must certify that the individual has never received a social security number .   MINC Tip: \nFor eligible household members  without \na social security number, management should submit the tenant data to MINC using all zeros.   MINC will assign a \nsystem generated number to the household member, and manage ment  \nmust use the assigned number on future transactions or until a valid social security number is available.  \n6-7 ",

This section provides guidance for calculating and verifying income for each of these purposes.  \nForm RD 3560-8 (Rev. 04 -25) reflects income and asset calculation changes as a result of the \nHousing Opportunity Through Modernization Act (HOTMA).  All tenant certifications effective July 1, 2025, or later must use the Form RD 3560-8 (Rev. 04-25) version of the form.  The previous form was renamed Form RD 3560-8A (Rev 08- 11) and must be used for tenant \ncertifications effective prior to July 1, 2025.  \nA.  Key Concepts for Income Determinations  \n1.  Income Definitions  \nTwo income definitions are used:  annual income and adjusted income.  Whenever \nincome determinations are made, it is essential that borrowers use the correct income definition and consider income from the appropriate household members. \n\u2022 Annual income.   Annual income is used as the base for computing adjusted income.  \nIncome of all household members should be considered when computing annual \nincome.  Annual income includes all amounts, not specifically excluded in Attachment 6 -A, received from all sources by each member of the household\n who is \n18 years of age or older or is the head of household or spouse of the head of household, plus unearned income by or on behalf of each dependent who is under 18 years of age.   Form RD 3560-8, Tenant C ertification  illustrates the calculation of \nannual income.  Paragraph 6.9 B in this section provides additional information on calculating annual income.  \no Earned income.   Earned income is income or earnings from wages, tips, salaries, \nother employee compensation, and ne t income from self -employment.  Earned \nincome does not include any pension or annuity, transfer payments (meaning payments made or income received in which no goods or services are being paid \n6-8 ",

Unearned income is any annual income, as calculated under \n24 CFR 5.609, that is not earned income.  \n\u2022 Adjusted income.   Adjusted income is used to determine whether an applicant is \nincome eligible to reside in multi -family rental housing or to receive rental subsidies.  \nFor guidance on calculating adjusted income, see Paragraph 6.9  C in this section.  \n2.  Projecting Income for a 12- Month Period  \nCurrent income and family circumstances may be used to estimate the household\u2019s \nincome over the next 12 months, unless there is verifiable evidence of a likely change in circumstances.  Historical information may be used to estimate income that is anticipated to be received for 12 months.  \nExample \u2013 Calculating Seasonal Income   \n(Options should be discussed with Tenant) \nOption #1  \nAssume a family member who currently has no income historically has seasonal income during the summer months and earns on an average of $4,000 during that time.  Confirm with the applicant that the same seasonal pattern is expected and use historical data to project income for the coming 12 months, which i n this case \nwould be $4000 projected annual income. \n Gross Tenant Contribution (GTC): \n$4000/12 months x 30% = $100/month \nfor 12 months Option #2  \nAssume a family member currently has seasonal  income of $1000 per month and \nis expected to last 4 months.  Annualizing \nthis income  would be $1000 x 12 months \n= $12,000. \nOnce the seasonal income ends, it is the \ntenant\u2019s responsibility to notify management and request a recertification of income.  \nNote: this method would require at least two recertifications each year . \nGross Tenant Contribution (GTC): \n$12,000/12 months x 30% = $ 300 month \nduring the months of earning seasonal \nincome. \n \n \n  \n6-9 ",

Income of Temporarily Absent Household Members  \nMembers may be temporarily \nabsent from the household for a variety \nof reasons, such as temporary military duty activation, temporary employment, or students who live away from home during the school year.  The income of these household members is \nconsidered when computing annual \nincome.  Households with a member permanently confined to a hospital or nursing home may choose to either include annual income attributable to such person, less deductions for which the person would qualify, or exclude the annual income attributable to such person and not take any \ndeductions for which the person would qualify.  \n4.  Zero Income.   \nIt is the policy of Rural Development not to accept a tenant certification for an \napplicant or tenant with zero income unless all income is specifically exempted.  Third \nparty verifications may be obtained from the employer.  If the tenant or applicant \ntypically receives unemployment during periods of layoff, the unemployment income is included in the income calculation.   \n     In cases where an applicant or tenant is claiming they have no household income, nor \ncan the tenant or applicant anticipate a source of income, it will be necessary for the applicant or tenant to demonstrate financial capability to meet basic living e xpenses and \nthe rental charge.  This amount must include income for essential living expenses such as, food, clothing, diapers, transportation and any nonessentials items being paid such as telephone, television service, internet service , etc.  The basis f or this income must be \ndocumented in the file.  Suggested guidance for the verification of zero income is found in Attachment 6 -B. \n     The borrower must review the circumstances of the tenant quarterly to determine if \ncircumstances have changed and document the tenant file .  The borrower must remind the \ntenant that the lease specifically states that it is the tenant\u2019s responsibility to immediately report changes in income to management.  \n5.  Student Financial Assistance.  \nFor tenants /households receiving HUD Section 8 assistance (project based or Housing \nChoice Vouchers), the borrower must adhere to  the specific Section 8 student financial \nassistance guidance for these tenants.  \nFor all other tenants/households (non-Section 8) the borrower must adhere to  the \nfollowing guidance for including student financial assistance as household income.   Example \u2014Temporarily Absent Member  \nJames Brown and his wife have applied for \na unit.  At the moment, James is working on a \nconstruction job on the other side of the state and comes home every other weekend.  He earns $600 per week and uses approximately \none-third of that amount for temporary living \nexpenses.  The full amount of the income \nearned would be counted for annual income.  \n6-10 ",

Calculating Adjusted Income  \nAdjusted income is used to determine eligibility for Multi-Family Housing programs, as \nwell as eligibility for and the amount of payment subsidies under rental assistance.  \nAdjusted income is calculated by subtracting from annual income any of five deductions \nthat apply to the household.  Not all households are eligible for all deductions.  Exhibit 6-1 summarizes these deductions.  Attachment 6 -C, Allowable Deductions, provides detail \nconcerning allowable deductions.

Dependent Deduction  \nA deduction from annual income of $480 ( this amount may be adjusted  annually by \nHUD) is made for each household member who qualifies as a dependent.  Dependents are \nhousehold members who are not the head or spouse and who are under 18 years of age , or \nis a person with a disability, or is a full -time student.  If an applicant requests a deduction \nfor dependents attending school full time, the applicant must provide documentation from the school that the dependent is enrolled as a full -time student.   \nUnborn children, foster children, foster adults, and State or Tribal kinship household \nmembers do NOT qualify for the dependent deduction. \n \n6-12 ",

While some anticipated expenses can be documented easily (for example, Medicare or other health insurance premiums and ongoing prescriptions), others need to be estimated.  The borrower should use historical information about medical bills to estimate future expenses.  However, the estimates should be realistic.  For example, if the  household has \na significant medical bill, the borrower will  count only that portion of the bill that is \nlikely to be paid during the coming year. \nD. Temporary Relief and Hardship exemptions  \n1. Financial hardship exemptions for Health and Medical care expense and disability assistance expense .  Effective with the implementation of the Housing Opportunity \nThrough Modernization Act (HOTMA), the threshold to deduct health and medical care expenses and disability assistance expenses has been increased from an excess of \n3 percent  to an excess of 10 percent of annual income.   Families may be eligible for \nrelief under one of two categories; phased- in relief or general relief, as defined below.  \nA family receiving phased- in relief may request to receive general hardship relief \ninstead; once a family chooses to obtain general relief, a family may no longer \nreceive the phased -in relief.  \nPhased- in Relief  \nAll households who received a deduction for unreimbursed health and medical care \nand/or disability assistance  expenses based on their most recent tenant certification  prior \nto July 1, 2025, will begin receiving the 24-month phased-in relief at their next annual \nrecertification  or interim recertification , whichever occurs first on or after July 1, 2025. \nHouseholds who receive phased -in relief will have eligible expenses deducted that \nexceed 5 percent of annual income for 12 months. Twelve months after the 5 percent phase-in began, households will have eligible expenses deducted that exceed 7.5 percent \nof annual income for the immediately following 12 months. After the household has \ncompleted the 24 months phase-in at the lower thresholds as described above, the \nhousehold will remain at the 10 percent threshold, unless the household qualifies for relief under the general hardship relief provision. Example \u2013 Calculating the  \nHealth and Medical Care Expense Deduction  \nThe Jensons are an elderly household with \nannual income of $25,000 and anticipated medical \nexpenses of $3,000 that are not covered by insurance or another source.

Management  will apply the phased- in relief threshold to deduct the expenses that \nexceed 5 percent of her annual income which is $600 ($1100 - $500) for this re certification . \nMs. Bell will receive the benefit of the unreimbursed health and medical expense deduction until \nAugust 1, 2026, when the threshold will be increased to 7.5 percent.

To receive general relief, a \nhousehold must demonstrate that the \nhousehold\u2019s unreimbursed health and medical care expenses or unreimbursed disability assistance expenses increased, or the household\u2019s financial hardship is a result of a change in circumstances that would not otherwise trigger a recertification.  \nGeneral rel ief is available regardless of \nwhether the household previously received an unreimbursed health and medical expense deduction or disability assistance expense deduction, are currently receiving phased -in \nhardship relief , or were previously eligible \nfor either the general relief or phased -in \nrelief.  \nIf a household is eligible for general relief, the household will receive a deduction \nfor the sum of el igible expenses that exceed 5 percent of annual income.

Many types of \nassets generate income that must be included in the calculations of annual income.  Attachment 6-D identifies certain types of assets that are excluded from net family assets .   \nRural Development does not have an asset limitation  or restriction on owning real property  \nfor household eligibility or rental assistance eligibility.  \n6-19 ",

Reporting Assets \nApplicants must provide information about household assets at the time of application \nand whenever income is reverified.  Applicants must provide sufficient information to enable \nthe borrower to verify the asset information and compute the market and cash value of the asset.   \nRefer to Attachment  6-H for acceptable forms of verification.    \nB.  Asset Definitions  \nAll assets are categorized as either real property or personal property.  Personal property \nis further categorized as necessary personal property or non-necessary personal property.   \nNet family assets is the net cash value of all assets (non-necessary property and real \nproperty) owned by the family. \n1. Real property   \nReal property has the same meaning as that provided under the state law in which \nthe real property is located.  Examples include a home or a piece of land.    \nReal property is not an asset if the household does not have effective legal \nauthority to sell it.   Examples include  co-ownership situations where one party cannot \nunilaterally sell the real property, property that is tied up in litigation , or inherited \nproperty that is in dispute . \n If real property, owned by the family, does not generate income or the income \namount cannot be computed, the imputed asset income must be calculated.  This applies if net family assets exceed $51,600, adjusted annually for inflation . \n \n2. Personal property  \n \nPersonal property are asset items that are not real property.  Personal property is \nseparated  into two  categories:  \n \n\u2022 Necessary personal  property .  Necessary personal property is excluded from net \nfamily assets and are items essential to the family for the main tenance, use, and \noccupancy of the pr emis es as a home; or they are necessary for employment, \neducation, or health and wellness or assist a household member with a disability .   \n \nItems classified as necessary personal property are excluded from net family \nassets and any income from necessary personal property is excluded from household income.  \n6-20 ",

Non -necessary personal property are i tems of \npersonal property that do not qualify as necessary personal property.  Examples of \nnon-necessary personal property can be found in Exhibit 6-2.    Unless specifically excluded from non -necessary personal property (see \nAttachment 6 -D), items classified as non -necessary personal property are included \nin net family assets.  Any income from non-necessary personal property is included in household income . \nExhibit 6 -2  \nExamples of non -necessary personal property.  This is not an all -inclusive  list. \n\u2022 Bank accounts or other financial investments (i.e. \u2013 checking account, savings \naccount, stocks/bonds)  \n\u2022 Recreational car/vehicle not needed for day -to-day transportation (campers, \nmotorhomes, travel trailers, all- terrain vehicles (ATVs), utility terrain vehicles \n(UTVs)  \n\u2022 Recreational boat/watercraft  \n\u2022 Expensive jewelry without religious or cultural value, or which does not hold family \nsignificance (this does NOT include wedding or engagement rings)  \n\u2022 Collectibles  \n\u2022 Equipment/machinery that is not used to generate income for a business  \n\u2022 Items such as gems/precious metals, antique cars, artwork, etc.  \nC.  Cal\nculating Market and Net Cash \nValue  \nThe market value  of an asset is simply its \ndollar value on the open market.  For example, the market value of $2,000 in a savings account is $2,000 and the market value of real estate is its appraised value.  The net cash value of an asset is the market \nvalue, less reasonable expenses to convert the asset to cash.  For example, the net cash value of stock worth $5,000 would be $5,000 less any broker\u2019s fee.  \nThe increase in market value of an asset \nis relevant to the net cash value of the asset \nfor the purpose of determining total net family assets and imputed  income.   An increase in \nmarket value is not considered as actual income for the asset.  \nExample  \u2013 Calculating the net cash value \nof an a sset \nMs. Smith  owns a home with an estimated \nmarket  value  of $90,000.  To determine the \nnet cash value of the home, management must \nsubtract the reasonable costs incurred to sell \nthe property.  The cash value would be:  \n$90,000  Market Value  \n-   $10,000 Mortgage balance  \n-   $ 5,400  6% real estate agent fee \n-   $ 2,000  Settlement costs  \n    $72,600 Net Cash value  \n \n6-21 ",

Calculating Income from Assets  \nFor the purpose of computing annual income, the assets of all household members  are \nconsidered.  In addition, if any household member has disposed of assets for less than fair market value during the two years preceding the effective date of certification or recertification, the asset must be considered when calculating income from a ssets for annual \nincome. \nIncome from assets is no longer determined based on the greater of actual or imputed \nincome from the assets. Instead, both actual income and imputed  income must be considered . \n(See Exhibit 6-3.) \n1.  Actual income from assets and imputed income from assets  \nActual income from assets is always included in a family\u2019s annual income, regardless \nof the total value of net family assets.  \nImputed income must be calculated for specific assets when three conditions are met:  \n\u2022 The value of net family assets exceeds the annual HUD published Inflationary \nAdjusted Value ; \n\u2022 The specific asset is included in net family assets; and  \n\u2022 Actual asset income cannot be calculated/determined for the specific asset.  \n \n  In cases where a household has net family assets that exceeds the annual HUD \npublished Inflationary Adjusted Value , if the actual income from assets can be computed \nfor some assets but not all assets, then management must add up the actual income from \nthe assets, where actual income can be calculated, then calculate the imputed income for the assets where actual income could not be calculated. After management  has calculated \nboth the actual income and imputed income, management  must combine both amounts to \naccount for income on net family assets.  \n \n   \n6-22 ",

The Act applies to all persons on active duty including reserve component service members called to active duty.  \n A tenant, co- tenant or spouse may terminate a lease covering premises occupied as a \ndwelling at any time following the date of the beginning of the period of the military service. The termination will be in writing and delivered to the property manager or the management firm in \nperson or by mail; following the date of the beginning of the military service (a set of appropriate military orders should accompany the termination letter). However, the lease termination will not be effective until 30 days after the first date on which the next rental payment is due. Example: next rent payment date is March 1; termination will be effective March 30.  \n Guardians who were not originally listed as tenants, but are so designated by the tenant or co-tenant, will be permitted to reside in the unit to care for minors while the tenant or co -tenant \nis absent due to military service. The term \u201cguardian\u201d means im mediate family member, relative \nor friend. \n The Act does not relieve the recently activated military person or that persons\u2019 household \nfrom meeting financial obligations. However, the Act does protect the soldier\u2019s dependent(s) left \nbehind (occupying family dwellings) from undue eviction or distress. \nA. Should eviction be necessary for violation of lease requirements, the Act provides \nopportunity for a stay of eviction for up to three consecutive months. Under no circumstance are borrowers entitled to take eviction matters into their own hands or to inform tenants that they must move because they no longer can afford the rent. The \nborrower may give the tenant notice of lease violation and termination for repeated late \npayment or nonpayment of rent in normal fashion, but evictions require court action. \nEvictions, three -month stays and relief actions are within the discretion of the court. \nBorrowers may not evict affected tenants without prior court approval. \nB. All tenants affected by the Soldiers\u2019 and Sailors\u2019 Civil Relief act are to be \nrecertified (upon receipt of their military orders) in accordance with 7 CFR Part 3560, in \norder to reflect their true rent contribution. Recertification should include all income such as severance pay, salary, reservist pay, housing allowance, etc. Hazard duty pay is not counted. Upon completion of tenant recertification, rents will be inc reased or decreased. \nTenant recertification may be processed by the co-tenant, spouse or guardian during the period of military service.  \n Example: If a tenant was contributing $275.00 (basic rent) per month towards rent, and their salary has decreased or increased due to leaving a previous position for military service, the new contribution towards rent may be significantly decreased or increased.

If a household is residing in the property and is out of compliance with the \noccupancy policy, the borrower must follow procedures outlined in Paragraph 6.30 for tenants in violation of occupancy policies. \nA.  Unit Density Standards  \nOccupancy policies set standards regarding the number of people that can be \nadequately housed in a unit of a particular size.  In developing the occupancy policy for each unit, the borrower must take into account the following: \n\u2022 State and local codes regarding the number of persons permitted to dwell in a unit of \na particular size;  \n\u2022 The size of the rooms in the particular unit;  \n\u2022 Procedures for sizing households for different unit types (how to consider temporarily \nabsent household members); and \n6-29 ",

In these cases, the borrower should make a judgment as to how many people may \nbe adequately housed, basing it on the square foot size and layout of the unit.  For example, some properties may have several sizes of two -bedroom units.

Procedures for Assigning Units \nOccupancy policies also establish the order in which eligible applicants and existing \ntenants will be housed or rehoused.  \nBorrowers are required to comply with Section 5 of this chapter in selecting and \nassigning applicants to new units or relocating over- or under- housed existing tenants.  However, it is important that these requirements are detailed in the borrower\u2019s occupancy policies, so that it is clear to new applicants and existing tenants how a vacant unit will be assigned.  \n6.14  OCCUPANCY RULES  [7 CFR 3560.157] \nThe purpose of the occupancy rules is to establish the basis for the tenant and \nmanagement relationship.   Prior to Agency approval of occupancy rules, borrowers must provide \nwritten certification from their attorney that the housing project's occupancy rules are consistent with applicable Federal, state, and local laws, as well as Agency requirements, and the requirements of all programs participating in the housing project.  \n In situations where the tenant is in violation of the occupancy rules and the tenant fails to correct the problem, the borrower should proceed to evict the tenant for material noncompliance with the lease.  In the event that an eviction action is filed with the court, the tenant should set up an escrow accoun t for the rent.  \n6-30 ",

Electronic Waiting Lists  \nElectronic waiting lists must have a mechanism for maintaining the date and time of \neach applicant\u2019s placement on and selection from the waiting list and a way to document \nchanges made to the list.  If an electronic waiting list is used, borrowers must periodically print out electronic waiting lists or preserve backup copies showing how the waiting list appeared before and after the removal of each name.  The following are examples of methods that borrowers might use to track inputs to the electronic waitin g list and \nchanges to it:  \n\u2022 Use a data backup function to record the time and date of entry of new applications and changes to existing records in the electronic waiting list. \n\u2022 Print a record of the appearance of the waiting list as often as necessary to  show each \napplicant\u2019s placement on and selection from the list.  The time and the date of the printout should appear on the report.  The owner can file this information in the tenant file and in a central waiting list file.  \n\u2022 Whenever status changes occur, such as changes in family composition and unit size, \nrecord the change with an explanation, and print the re- sorted list.  \nTo the extent possible, the borrower should use electronic safeguards, such as \nassigning waiting list password access only to individuals responsible for maintaining the \nsystem.  Ideally, a system should record the username,  and the time, date, and action \nentered whenever a record is changed or entered in the electronic waiting list.  \n2.  Selecting Applications from the Waiting List  \nOnce an applicant has submitted a complete application, the date and time must be \nrecorded on the waiting list to establish priority for selection.  Selection from the waiting list will be made according to date and time in the following order:  \n\u2022 Very low- income applicants;  \n\u2022 Low-income applicants; and  \n\u2022 Moderate- income applicants.  \nSee paragraph 6.3 for information regarding how to determine the specific income \nlevel of an applicant.  \nWithin 10 calendar days of receipt of a complete application, the borrower must \nnotify the applicant in writing that they have been selected for immediate occupancy, \nplaced on a waiting list, or rejected.  \n6-36 ",

(See VAWA Attachment 6 -K Section F.) \n Borrowers are required to notify all applicants in writing of their ineligibility.  If \napplicants are determined to be ineligible, the rejection letter must outline the reason for rejection of the application and their right to respond to such decision in accordance with 7 CFR 3560.154 and 7 CFR 3560.160. The rejection letter must advise the applicants of their right to respond to the  decision within 10 calendar days , as well as the right to a hearing  in accordance \nwith 7 CFR 3560.160, which must be made available to the applicant upon request .  If the project \nis located in an area with a high concentration of non\u2013English-speaking individuals, the letter must be in English and the non\u2013English language that is prevalent in the area.

If there are no such over- or under- housed existing tenants, the borrower must select a new applicant from the waiting list \nto fill the newly vacant unit.  The borrower must use the project\u2019s occupancy policy to review  \napplicants on the waiting list who are eligible based on the unit size.  From that universe, the borrower must then determine, based on income levels and priorities, which applicant is entitled to the unit.  The order in which applicant households are entitled to housing depends on two factors:  \n\u2022 The income level of the household; and  \n\u2022 The priorities for which the household may qualify. \nWhen an applicant first submitted an application, the borrower made an initial \ndetermination as to whether the household was very low- , low -, or moderate- income.  Based on \nthis assessment, the applicant was assigned to the very low -, low-, or moderate- income waiting \nlist.  When looking for the next eligible tenant for the vacant unit, the borrower must first go to \nthe very- low income waiting list.  If there are no applicants on the very low -income waiting list \nwho qualify for the vacant unit based on the property's occupancy policy, then the borrower may go to the low- income waiting list.  Only if there are no eligible applicants for the unit on the low -\nincome waiting list may the borrower select an eligible applicant from the moderate -income \nwaiting list.  \n6-38 ",

Exceptions to Income Standard Assignment Policies  \nWhile the basic standard is to house all very low-income applicants prior to low- and then \nmoderate -income applicants, there are situations where this process may be bypassed.  \nHowever, an individual in one of the situations identified below would not be e ligible for \nhousing before applicants on the waiting list for a lower income category. \n\u2022 If the unit is a handicapped accessible unit, then an eligible household that needs the \nfeatures of that unit will receive priority over all other applicants, regardless of income.  If more than one applicant needs the features of the handicapped accessible unit, then applicants who are very low -income would have priority, followed by low- \nand then moderate-income households. \n\u2022 In congregate housing facilities, applicants who qualify for and agree to utilize the services provided by the facility will be housed over all other applicants on the waiting list.  Where there is more than one applicant that meets this criterion, the applicants meeting this condition will be ranked by very low-, low- , and moderate - \nincome and housed in accordance with the occupancy policies established at the property. \n\u2022 Borrowers with projects receiving low -income housing tax credits (LIHTCs), may \nleave a housing unit vacant if they are required to rent the available unit to an LIHTC-eligible applicant, and none of the applicants on the waiting list meet the applicable LIHTC eligibility requirements.  \nExample \u2014 Exceptions  \nProject B has two handicap -accessible units.  There are three \ndisabled individuals who need the features of the handicap-\naccessible units on the waiting list:  one moderate income and two low-income.  The property has a waiting list of 20 very low -income \napplicants.  The borrower must rent the two handicap -accessible \nunits to  the two low -income applicants.   \nProject Z is a congregate housing facility and has a vacant one-\nbedroom unit.  There are three individuals eligible for a one -\nbedroom unit on the waiting list:  two very low -income applicants \nand one low -income applicant.  All qualify for congregate care \nservices.  Only one of the very low-income applicants, however, would agree to use the congregate care facilities.  The borrower \nwould have to offer one of the vacant units to the very low -income \napplicant who agrees to use the services and the other unit to the \nlow-income applicant who agrees to use the services.  \n \n\u2022 Letter of Priority Entitlement (LOPE), Handbook Letter 201.

There are no \napplicants eligible for a three -bedroom unit on the very low -income \nwaiting list.  There are 20 applicants eligible for a three -bedroom unit \non the low -income waiting list.  A holder of a LOPE applies for \noccupancy at the project.  The applicant is low-income and qualifies \nfor a tw o-bedroom unit.  Despite the number of applicants on the \nwaiting list, the borrower must offer the available unit to the LOPE holder, and the LOPE holder agrees to move to the appropriate -size \nunit when one becomes available.  \n\u2022 Borrowers who have adopted an admission or waiting list priority  for victims of \ndomestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking who are non- RD \ntenants referred by other federal, state, or local housing agencies, or a partnering \nservice organization.

Assignment of Rental Units Accessible to Individuals with Disabilities  \nEligibility requirements for fully accessible units are contained in 7 CFR 3560.154(g)(1)(i) and 3560.155(b).  If a rental unit accessible to individuals with disabilities is available and there are no applicants that require the features of the unit, the borrower may rent the unit to a non-disabled tenant under the following conditions: \n\u2022 The borrower must include a provision in the lease requiring the tenant to vacate the unit within 30 days of notification to an appropriate ly sized vacant unit within the \nproject. Additionally, the lease clause must ensure that the household may remain in the rental unit with accessibility features until an appropriately sized vacant unit within the project becomes available and then must move or vacate within 30 days of notification from borrower; \n\u2022 The unit has been marketed as an accessible unit;  \n\u2022 Outreach has been made to organizations representing the disabled; and  \n\u2022 Marketing of the unit as an accessible unit continues after it is rented to a tenant who \nis not in need of the special design features. \nC.

The Agency must approve the lease before the borrower enters into a lease agreement with any tenant.  \n6.23  DEVELOPMENT OF A LEASE  \nThe borrower is responsible for the development of the tenant lease that will be used at \nthe property.  This lease must contain the required items, provisions and clauses outlined in Attachment 6 -E and must be free of prohibited clauses listed in Attachment 6 -F.

Expiration of the lease is not of itself grounds for a termination of tenancy. \n6.25  AGENCY REVIEW AND MONITORING OF LEASE REQUIREMENTS  \nThe management agent must review and monitor the implementation of the lease with the \napplicant/tenant to ensure that they are properly informed of their rights and responsibilities \nunder the lease.  During the compliance review process, the Agency will assure:  \n\u2022 The occupancy rules are attached to the initial lease;  \n\u2022 The applicant understands their rights to the tenant grievance process under HUD Section 8 and 7 CFR 3560.160; and \n\u2022 The applicant understands the process for relaying information such as maintenance \nrequests and income information to management and the responsibility to do so in a \ntimely manner.  \n\u2022 The adult applicant s understand their rights, protections, and responsibilities under \nthe VAWA Lease Addendum and ha ve received Forms HUD -5380 and HUD-5382. \n(See Attachment 6 -K Section I, paragraph 5.) \nIf the MFH Servicing Official determines the borrower is failing to provide adequate \ninformation regarding the rights and responsibilities of the tenant and the management agent, the MFH Servicing Official will require the borrower to improve the management plan and training \nof onsite staff.  \n \nSECTION 7:  TENANT RECERTIFICATION AND  \nCHANGES IN ELIGIBILITY [7 CFR 3560.152 and 7 CFR 3560.158]  \nThe recertification process developed in this section is designed to ensure a tenant \nremains eligible to reside in multi -family housing.  As household status changes, the size of the \nunit needed by the household or the amount of rent that they are obligated to pay may change.  \nThis section discusses when a recertification is required and what action the borrower is  required \nto take if a household is determined ineligible to continue residing at the property.  \n6.26  REQUIREMENTS TO RECERTIFY TENANTS  \n6-43 ",

The Annual Recertification Process  \nEach time a resident is recertified, the certification is good for one year, unless \nParagraph B Interim Recertification Process requires a recertification to be completed \nmore frequently.  At the end of the year the certification will expire, and the borrower is \nrequired to recertify the household.  In most cases, the effective date of the recertification  \nis the first day of the month following the expiration of the current certification . If the \nowner/management agent or tenant fail to recertify timely, the effective date  will be  the \nfirst of the month after the recertification has been exe cuted  by the owner/management \nagent and the  tenant .   \nUsing the procedures outlined in Section 1 of this chapter, the borrower will complete \na new certification.  The key steps to this process include:  \n1.  Notifying the t enant of the r ecertification r equirement  \nAt least 75 to 90 days prior to the date that the certification expires, the borrower \nmust notify the tenant in writing that they must be recertified to remain eligible to \ncontinue residence at the property.  This letter will also include what information the borrower needs from the household to complete the recertification  process. \nIf the household fails to respond to the letter, the borrower should issue a second \nletter 30 days prior to the date which the certification expires informing the tenant of:  \n\u2022 The i nformation needed to recertify;  \n\u2022 The time frame in which the new certification must be submitted to the Agency; and \n\u2022 The consequences for failure to comply with the recertification process.  \n2.  Execution of the annual rec ertification  \nUpon receiving the information regarding household size and income from the tenant, \nthe borrower will verify the information and the borrower and the tenant will complete a new Form RD 3560-8.  This form will document the calculation of annual income and adjusted income (in accordance with Section 1 of this chapter) and the calculation of the tenant payment (in accordance with Chapters 7 and 8).  Management agents must give each adult household member the VAWA Form HUD- 5380, \u201cNotice of Occupancy \nRights\u201d and the Form HUD -5382, \u201cCertification of Domestic Violence\u201d with \nacknowledgement of receipt.

Tenant Requirements  \n\u2022 Tenants must provide borrowers with the necessary income and other household information required by the Agency to determine eligibility. \n\u2022 Tenants must authorize borrowers to verify information provided to establish their \neligibility or determination of tenant contribution.  \n\u2022 Tenants must report all changes in household status that may affect their eligibility to \nborrowers. \n\u2022 Tenants who fail to comply with tenant certification and recertification requirements will be considered ineligible for occupancy and will be subject to unauthorized assistance claims, if applicable, as specified in 7 CFR part 3560, subpart O. \n2.  Borrower Requirements  \n\u2022 Borrowers must verify household income and other information necessary to establish tenant eligibility for the requested rental unit type, in a format approved by the Agency, prior to a tenant\u2019s initial occupancy and prior to annual or other recertificatio ns. \n\u2022 Borrowers must review all reported changes in household status and assess the impact \nof these changes on the tenant\u2019s eligibility or net tenant contribution.  \n\u2022 Borrowers must submit initial or updated tenant certification forms to the Agency \nwithin 10 days of the effective date of an initial certification or any changes in a \ntenant\u2019s status.  The effective date of an initial or updated tenant certification form will always be a first day of the month.  \n\u2022 Since tenant certifications are used to document interest credit and rental assistance eligibility and are a basic responsibility of the borrower under the loan documents, borrowers who fail to submit annual or updated tenant certification forms within the  \ntime period specified in this paragraph, will be charged overage, as specified in 7 CFR 3560.203(c) and lost rental assistance.  Unauthorized assistance, if any, will be handled in accordance with 7 CFR part 3560, subpart O. \n\u2022 Borrowers must give each adult household member the VAWA Form HUD-5380, \n\u201cNotice of Occupancy Rights\u201d and the Form HUD-5382, \u201cCertification of Domestic \nViolence\u201d at every recertification , with acknowledgement of receipt.

Submission of the Certification to the Agency  \nOnce the borrower and the tenant execute a certification, it must be submitted to the Agency within 10 days of the effective date of the certification.  In order for a \ncertification to be valid, it must be signed and dated by all parties on or before the effective date and maintained in the tenant file.  If a borrower fails to submit a n executed  \ncertification within 10 days of the effective date, it will result in monetary penalties  \n(overage)  to the borrower as established in Chapter 7. \n6.27  AGENCY REVIEW AND MONITORING OF THE RECERTIFICATION PROCESS  \nA.

The MFH Servicing Officials  will make the following assessments:  \n\u2022 Are tenants receiving the proper notice \u2014at least 75-90 days in advance of the \nexpiration of the current certification?  \n\u2022 Are adult household members acknowledging receipt of the forms HUD-5380 and \nHUD-5382? (See Attachment 6-K Section R.) \n\u2022 Does the recertification notice provide the tenant with a list of the information needed \nfor the completion of the recertification process?  \n\u2022 Are borrowers accurately determining when an interim recertification is needed?  \n\u2022 Are interim recertifications being executed on a timely basis (i.e., no later than 30 \ndays from the time the information is provided to the borrower)?  \n\u2022 Is the borrower completing the verification of information on a timely basis?  \nIf the MFH Servicing Official concludes that the borrower is deficient in recertifying \nexisting tenants, the Agency must require the borrower and the management agent to \n6-46 ",

Management Agent Interactive Network Connection (MINC)   \nMINC is the mechanism by which borrowers submit tenant certifications to the Agency electronically on a monthly basis. \nFor projects with eight units or more, all borrowers will be required to submit tenant \ncertifications through MINC.  The Agency may make an exception to this requirement if \nthe borrower submits documentation that the costs associated with electronic submiss ion \nof tenant certifications would pose a financial hardship to the project.   \nIf the borrower is using MINC, certifications must be submitted by the tenth of the month \nfor which they are due.  For instance, if the borrower is submitting certification due in May with an effective date of May 1, the certifications must be electronically transmitted to the Agency by May 10.  If for any reason the borrower is unable to transmit the certifications electronically during a given month, the borrower must submit the hard copies of the certifications to the Agency for receipt by the tenth of t he month.  \nIf the Agency approved a MINC waiver for a project with less than 8 units, borrowers must submit hard copies of certifications to the Agency for receipt by the tenth of the \nmonth.   \nRegardless of the transmission method used\u2014MINC or hard copies\u2014if the Agency does \nnot receive certifications by the tenth of the month in which they are due and the borrower has not submitted an overage waiver for Agency consideration, the borrower \nwill be subject to overage penalty. \nAttachment 6 -G provides guidance on acquiring automation support /software  for MINC \nor other automation needs, along with a listing of software providers who have an  interest \nin interfacing with M INC.  \n6.28  INELIGIBLE TENANTS  \nIneligible tenants are those who, upon recertification, fail to meet either the income or the \noccupancy requirements for the unit and property that they currently occupy.

Continuation of Tenancy\u2014Tenants Who Fail to Comply with the Occupancy Policy  \nIn some situations, a tenant may be ineligible based on the size of the unit currently \noccupied but could become eligible if they relocated to a unit of a different size (either \nlarger or smaller) within the property.  In this situation, a tenant may continue tenancy as an ineligible tenant, but the borrower should relocate the household to the proper unit size as soon as a unit of that size becomes available.  \nIn some cases, a household may require a unit size that is unavailable at the property.  In this situation the tenant would be considered ineligible and required to vacate the property within 30 days or at the end of their lease, whichever is longer. \nB.  Continuation of Tenancy\u2014Tenants Who Fail to Comply with the Income \nRequirements for the Property  \nIn most cases, if tenant certifications indicate that they no longer comply with the income limits set for the property, tenants must be notified about vacating the property in 30 days \nor at the end of their lease, whichever is longer. \nElderly households with incomes above the moderate- income level may occupy projects \nwith an Agency loan approved prior to 1968 with a loan agreement that does not restrict \noccupancy by income. \nHouseholds who are elderly, disabled, and living in a full- profit plan development are not  \nrequired to move or pay an increased rent if household income increases above moderate \nincome. \n \nC.

The notice must \ngive specific reasons for the proposed action.  The notice must also advise the tenant or prospective tenant of \u201cthe right to respond to the notice within 10 calendar days after date of the \nnotice\u201d and of \u201cthe right to a hearing in accordance with 7 CFR 3560.160 (f), which is available upon request.\u201d  The notice must contain the information specified in 7 CFR 3560.160 (a)(2).  For housing projects in areas with a concentration of non-English-speaking individuals, the notice must be in English and the non-English language. \n6.32  OVERVIEW OF THE PROCESS  \nThe grievance process should always begin with an informal meeting between the \ngrieved party and the borrower/management agent.  It is the Agency\u2019s belief that the best way to \nresolve grievances is through an informal meeting between the two parties.   \nBorrowers must offer to meet with tenants  or prospective tenants to discuss the grievance \nwithin 10 calendar days of receiving the grievance.  If an informal meeting is held, the borrower \nmust provide a summary of the meeting to the tenant within 10 calendar days of the meeting \ndate.  The Agency encourages borrowers and tenants or prospective tenants to make an effort to reach a mutually satisfactory resolution to the grievance at the meeting.  \nWithin 10 calendar days after receipt of the summary of any informal meeting, if the \ntenant or prospective tenant desires a hearing, a written request for a hearing must be submitted to the borrower.  The parties will select a hearing panel or hearing officer to govern the hearing.  Within 10 calendar days after the hearing, all parties are informed of the decision.

Request for a Hearing  \n\u2022 Each hearing process must begin with the request for a hearing.  The tenant or prospective tenant must present their request to the borrower in writing within 10 \ncalendar days  after the receipt of the summary of the informal meeting.  The request \nmust contain the following information: \no The reason for the grievance or contest of the borrower/management agent\u2019s \nproposed action; \no The action relief sought; and \no Additional information.  \n\u2022 If the tenant or prospective tenant\u2019s request for a hearing is not received within the given time, the borrower or management agent\u2019s decision will become final.  \nB.  Scheduling the Hearing  \nThe hearing must be scheduled within 15 calendar days after the receipt of the \ntenant\u2019s request for a hearing.  If a hearing officer or hearing panel must be selected, the hearing will be scheduled within 15 calendar days  after the selection or appointment of a \nhearing officer or hearing panel.  It is the responsibility of the two parties to agree upon a place and time that is mutually convenient to hold the hearing.  If the two parties cannot agree on a place and time, it  will become the responsibility of the hearing officer or \nhearing panel to make the decision. \nC.  Selection of the Hearing Officer or Hearing Panel  \nThe two parties must select a hearing officer.  If the hearing officer cannot be agreed \nupon, the two parties will choose members to serve on the hearing panel.  The hearing panel should consist of three members.  The tenant and the borrower/management agent will each select one person to the panel.  It is then the responsibility of the two chosen members to select a third member to the panel.  If within 30 days from the time the \nrequest for the hearing was submitted a hearing officer or hearing panel has n ot been \nselected , the borrower/management agent must inform the Agency. The Agency will \nselect  a hearing officer.  The selected hearing officer or panel may contact the Agency for \nguidance on their responsibilities for conducting the hearing.  \nSome helpful information that should be remembered by all parties involved in the  \nprocess when selecting a hearing officer or hearing panel includes:   \n6-56 ",

If a standing \npanel is chosen, the above- listed process will have to be forfeited in lieu of the following \nprocess.  \n\u2022 A hearing panel consists of three members: one tenant panelist, one \nborrower/management agent panelist, and a chair. \n\u2022 Tenants will get to nominate and vote for their panel members.  A meeting must be \nheld to allow the tenants the opportunity to choose two members to serve on the standing panel; one member will serve as the alternate.  All residents should be notified of t he time, date, and place where the election is going to take place. The \nborrower is responsible for ensuring that the notice is placed in a conspicuous place, within 2 weeks of the time the person is expected to start serving as a panel member.  \nThe meeting must also be held in a place that is convenient and accessible to the tenants.  \n\u2022 The borrower/management agent is responsible for selecting one or two members to serve on the standing panel.  If two members are chosen, one will serve as the alternate.  \n\u2022 The third and \u201cmutual\u201d member of the panel will serve as the chair for the panel.  The other two interested parties will elect the chairperson.  Each party will only have the opportunity to give one vote, even if two people were elected to serve on the panel.  \n\u2022 Each member will serve on the panel for one year, with the opportunity for reelection.  \nAll members of the standing panel must be willing to render their services without \ncompensation. \nD.  Examination of Records \nAt a reasonable time before the hearing, the borrower/ management agent must allow \nthe tenant the opportunity to examine all files that are going to be used during the hearing.

E\nscrow Deposits  \nTenants may establish escrow accounts if a grievance involves a rent increase not \nauthorized by the Agency or if the borrower/ management agent is not maintaining the \nproperty in a decent , safe, and sanitary manner.  The escrow account will allow the tenant \nthe opportunity to make timely rent payments without having the borrower/management agent receive the payment until the grievance has been settled.  To maintain an escrow account, tenants must adhere to the following rules: \n\u2022 All deposits must continue until the grievance is resolved;  \n\u2022 The institution that the escrow account is established in must be a Federally insured \ninstitution; \n\u2022 All deposits must be made on time \u2014failure to do so will terminate the entire \ngrievance process and all sums will be due immediately; and  \n\u2022 Tenants must make all receipts of deposit available for examination by the borrower/ management agent. \n6.36  REQUIREMENTS GOVERNING THE HEARING  \nThe hearing is an informal proceeding at which evidence is presented to a hearing officer or hearing panel.  The hearing must be designed to ensure that the rights of all parties involved are protected.  The hearing must protect: \n\u2022 The right of both parties to be represented by counsel or another person(s) chosen as \ntheir representative;  \n\u2022 The right of the tenant or prospective tenant to a private hearing unless a public one is \nrequested;  \n \n\u2022 The right of the tenant or prospective tenant to present oral and written evidence and \narguments in support of their grievance, and to cross- examine and refute  the evidence \nof all witnesses on whose testimony or information the borrower or management agent relies; and  \n6-58 ",

All participants at the hearing must conduct themselves in an orderly manner.  Participants that cannot conduct themselves in an orderly manner may be excluded from the proceedings or may cause the hearing panel or hearing officer to make a decision that is \nnot in favor of the disorderly party. \nIf the tenant or prospective tenant or borrower/ management agent fails to appear at a \nscheduled hearing, the hearing officer or hearing panel may choose to postpone the \nhearing for no more than 5 days or may determine that the absent party has waived their \nright to a hearing under this subpart.  If the determination is made that the absent party has waived their rights, the hearing officer or hearing panel will make a decision on the grievance.  All parties involved in the hearing must  be informed in writin g of the hearing \npanel\u2019s decision.  \n6.37  THE HEARING DECISION \nIt is the responsibility of the hearing officer or hearing panel to prepare and submit a \nwritten decision to both parties within 10 calendar days after the hearing.  The hearing \nofficer or hearing panel must provide a copy of the decision to the Agency and the reasons for making that decision. The decision should be based on the facts that were presented during the hearing. The decision is final unless the tenant or prospective tenant and the borrower/management agent are notified within 10 calendar days by the Agency that the decision is not in compliance with Agency regulations. This contingent form of approval should be noted in the decision letter.  Upon receipt of the letter, the borrower and the tenant must comply with the directives specified in the decision.  \n \nSECTION 9:  SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR LABOR HOUSING \n[7 CFR 3560 SUBPART L  AND M ] \nWhile the Agency -sponsored Labor Housing programs have similar requirements in \nmany respects to the Rural Rental Housing programs, because the target populations that these programs serve vary, there are some differences in program rules. \nThis section is designed to highlight these differences with regard to the occupancy rules.  \nUnless otherwise noted below, the requirements throughout this chapter also apply to Labor Housing projects. \n  \n6-59 ",

Eligible Tenants  \nLabor Housing tenants must meet all of the following criteria in order to be defined as \nan eligible tenant for the purposes of residing in labor housing: \n\u2022 Occupational.   An eligible household must include a tenant or co -tenant who is a \ndomestic farm laborer, a retired or disabled domestic farm laborer, or must be a \nsurviving household of a deceased domestic farm laborer.  \nA domestic farm laborer  is a person who, consistent with the requirements in 7 CFR \n3560.576(b)(2) , receives a substantial portion of his or her income from f arm labor \nemployment (not self-employed) in the United States, Puerto Rico, or the Virgin \nIslands and either is a citizen of the United States or resides in the United States, Puerto Rico, or the Virgin Islands after being legally admitted for permanent residence, or a person legally admitted to the United States and authorized to work in \nagriculture. This definition may include the immediate family members residing with such a person.  \n\u2022 Income.   The household must meet the definition of income eligibility as defined in \nSection 1 of this chapter and receive a substantial portion of income from farm labor \nemployment. To determine if a substantial portion of income is from farm labor employment, the following measures will be used.  \no For housing rented to farm laborers and owned by public bodies, public or private \nnonprofit organizations, and limited partnerships charging rent :  \n\uf0a7 Actual dollars earned from farm labor by domestic farm laborers other \nthan migrant farmworkers must equal at least 65 percent of the annual income limits indicated for the Standard Federal regions.  \n\uf0a7 For migrant farmworkers living in seasonal housing, actual dollars earned from farm labor by a domestic farm laborer must equal at least 50 percent of annual income limits indicated for the Standard Federal regions.  \n\uf0a7 An alternate measure for determining substantial portion of income when actual earnings are not available may be the duration of time a farm laborer worked on a farm or other farming enterprise as a domestic farmworker during the preceding 12 months. To be considered as substantial the farm laborer must have worked at least 110 whole days in farm work. For purposes of this section one whole day is the equivalent of at least 7 hours. When using a period of more than 1 year, a yearly average must amount to at least 110 days per year.  \no For housing owned by a farmer, family- farm partnership, family -farm \ncorporation, or an association of farmers which was initially provided on a non-\n6-60 ",

While  operating  costs will be reduced  in the long term,  there  may be \nsome short- term increases to accommodate the initial acquisition of automated support.  \nGuidelines for obtaining automated  support for MINC are as follows:  \n\u2022 With prior Agency approval, borrowers may use project operating or reserve funds to \npurchase or lease hardware or software needed to participate in MINC.  \n\u2022 Once borrowers have acquired automation capabilities, they may allow their management agent to use them to participate in MINC. This cost shall be prorated over several projects owned by different borrower entities with a common management agent. \n\u2022 When the cost of acquiring management software or hardware is not cost effective for \na project (or multiple projects with common management), the Agency may allow the \ncost of contracting with a service bureau to provide automation support as a project operating expense.  \n\u2022 To request Agency approval, borrowers must submit a brief proposal that documents \nthe anticipated costs and benefits of adopting the automation strategy being proposed. \n1. Acquiring Additional Automation Capabilities  \nIt is important to note that the approval for the use of project funds discussed above \nextends only to the portion of the computer software and hardware needed to participate in MINC.  If additional software or hardware capacity  is desired  by the borrower,  the following \napplies:  \n\u2022 MFH borrowers are encouraged to use automated systems to manage MFH projects and to prepare and process paperwork associated with project management. Where economically feasible, computer applications can improve management efficiency and reduce errors and omissions. However, the purchase of computer hardware and software out of project funds should be carefully analyzed.  \n\u2022 If a borrower entity\u2019s purchase of computer hardware or software to be used solely at a project can be expected to show a reduction in project operating and maintenance expenses, the purchase cost may be approved by the Agency as a line -item project \nexpens e. The expense may be approved at project inception out of the project\u2019s two HB-2-3560 \nAttachment 6 -G \nPage 1 of 3 \n ",

The cost shall be prorated over several projects owned by the same \nborrower entity. Any computer hardware or software purchased with project funds must remain with the project if there is any subsequent change in management or ownership of the project.  \n2. Choosing to Use a Service Bureau  \nIf acquiring automation is not a sound decision, borrowers may consider using a service \nbureau to provide automation services at a fee. The fee can be a project expense and shall be reasonable. The Agency must approve a borrower\u2019s determination that it is in the best interest of the project to contract with a service bureau.  \nThe cost of a service bureau is essentially an expense to an operating budget, since the \nfunction is not currently performed by any project. Borrowers who find that their project budget will not support the cost of acquiring automation support or a service  bureau fee should contact \ntheir servicing office to be exempted from mandatory participation in MINC.  \nThe Agency will not allow the cost of a service bureau if the borrower\u2019s analysis \ndemonstrates that it is less expensive to acquire an automation capacity, unless extenuating circumstances exist.  \nThe Agency will not approve the use of a service bureau fee as a project expense for a \ncontract with a firm that has an Identify -of-Interest (IOI) with the project borrower or management \nagent, without detailed documentation indicating that the IOI service  bureau is clearly more cost \neffective than a non -IOI service bureau. While this policy does not restrict the formation of IOI \nfirms to process tenant certifications, service bureau companies or the payment for their services from a management fee, it is intended to address concerns expressed by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG) that IOI firms may unnecessarily inflate project operating expenses.  \nThe following individuals and companies have expressed an interest in developing or \nmarketing software to provide an industry interface with Rural Development\u2019s MINC system. Rural Development expresses no preference or opinion on the products or services of any of the individuals and companies listed below.  \n \n     ",

About  this Guide  \nThis guide is for Rural Development (RD) Multifamily Housing\u2019s (MFH) Servicing Officials and contains \nthe program requirements for administering and complying with the Violence Against Women \nReauthorization Act of 2013 (VAWA),  as amended.  This guide  does not encompass  every  aspect  of VAWA, \nand therefore, should be used in conjunction with Public Law 113 -4, Title VI of VAWA \u201cSafe Homes for \nVictims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, and Stalking,\u201d and the U.S. Department of \nHousing and Community Development\u2019s (HUD) Housing Protections for Victims of Domestic Violence, \nDating Violence, Sexual Assault, and Stalking regulation at eCFR :: 24 CFR Part 5 Subpart L -- Protection \nfor Victims of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking. \nRelated reference documents include RD\u2019s Multifamily Housing Program regulation (7 CFR 3560), and the \nRD Multifamily Housing Asset Management Handbook (HB-2 -3560). All of HUD\u2019s documents referenced \nin this guide  are available  on HUD\u2019s website,  VAWA Resources  for Multifamily  Assisted  Housing . Where a \nproperty is covered by multiple housing programs (i.e., Section 8 voucher, 515, and LIHTC), victims should be able to take advantage of all of the VAWA protections within each program. When there is a conflict \nbetween VAWA and RD\u2019s program regulations, w hichever law, regulation, or policy that provides greater \nprotections for a victim applies. \nB.  Fair Housing  and Non-Discrimination  \n \nIn addition to the VAWA Act, Borrowers are subject to the Fair Housing Act, Title VI of the Civil Rights  \nAct of 1964, Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, as amended, section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of \n1973, the Age Discrimination  Act of 1975, Americans  with Disabilities  Act of 1990, other applicable  Federal \nlaws, and Agency requirements related to occupancy and tenant eligibility.  \n \nUnder the Fair Housing Act, individuals have the right to be free from discrimination when seeking housing \nto buy or rent, be protected from eviction, be treated the same as other tenants or occupants by a housing \nprovider, request  a reasonable  accommodation  to ensure  that someone  with a disability  has equal  opportunity \nto use and enjoy housing, and receive equal access to housing programs without regard to a person\u2019s sex or \nmarital status. Individuals who believe their VAWA rights have been violated may file complaints with \nFHEO, and FHEO will begin investiga ting such complaints using HUD\u2019s existing Fair Housing Act \ncomplaint process. Should an individual believe their rights under VAWA have been violated, they may file a complaint at https://www.hud.gov/fairhousing.  \nVAWA protections are not limited to women. Persons who are threatened or actual victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking are eligible for protections without regard to sex and cannot  be discriminated  against  on the basis  of any protected  characteristic,  including race,  color, national \norigin, religion, sex, familial status, disability, or age. \n \nWhen obtaining information from a victim of \ndomestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or \nstalking , Borrowers  must  take appropriate  steps  to ensure  effective communication  with applicants  and tenants   HB-2-3560 \nAttachment 6 -K    \nPage 3 of 38 ",

Acts of Borrower  non-compliance  with VAWA  must be reported to the USDA\u2019s Office \nof Civil Rights. \nC.  What  is VAWA \nOn March 7, 2013, the VAWA Act of 2013 was initially signed into law as Public Law 113-4 and became \neffective for RD\u2019s Housing Programs. It applies to RD\u2019s Sections 515, 515/8, 514/516, 533, 538, and 542 \nhousing programs (referred collectively as the RD -covered programs). Applicants, tenants, and household \nmembers  of tenants  assisted  under these  programs  may not be denied  admission  to, denied assistance under, \nterminated from participation in, or evicted from the housing as a direct result of the fact that the applicant, \ntenant, or household member is or has been a victim or there is an imminent threat of domestic violence, \ndating violence, sexual assault , or stalking, if the appl icant or tenant otherwise qualifies for admission, \nassistance, participation, or occupancy. \n \nThe VAWA Reauthorization Act of 2022 was signed into law on March 15, 2022. VAWA 2022 enhances housing protections for victims applying for and living in RD -covered units. VAWA 2022 protects an \nindividual\u2019s right to call emergency services and report crime  from their homes, which means that families \ndo not have  to fear losing  their housing  if they need  to call 9-1-1. The protections  also ensure  that individuals \ndo not have to fear retaliation from their landlord for exercising their rights under VAWA or assisting others \nin doing so, including filing VAWA complaints. \n \nD.  Key Definitions  \nRD\u2019s  MFH  Servicing Officials  and Borrowers  should familiarize  the meaning  of the following terms:  \nActual and imminent threat refers to a physical danger that is real, would occur within an immediate time frame,  and could result  in death  or serious  bodily harm.  In determining  whether  an individual  would pose an \nactual and imminent threat, the factors to be considered include: the duration of the risk, the nature and \nseverity  of the potential  harm, the likelihood that the potential  harm  will occur, and the length  of time before \nthe potential harm would occur. \n \nAffiliated  individual, with respect  to an individual, means:  \n\uf0fc A spouse, parent, brother,  sister,  or child  of that individual,  or an individual  to whom  that individual \nstands in place of a parent or guardian (for example, the affiliated individual is a person in the care, custody, or control of that individual); or \n\uf0fc Any individual,  tenant,  or lawful  occupant  living  in the household  of that individual.

Eligibility  and Adverse Factors  as a Direct  Result  of Domestic  Violence,  Dating Violence,  Sexual  \nAssault, Or Stalking  \n \nThe Direct Result provision prohibits Borrowers from denying admission to, denying assistance under, \nterminating participation in, or evicting a tenant based on an adverse factor, if the adverse factor is \ndetermined  to be a direct  result  of the fact that the applicant  or tenant  is or has been  a victim of domestic \nviolence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. \n \nAn adverse factor refers to any factor that can be used as a basis for denying admission or assistance, \nterminating  assistance  or participation  in a program, or evicting  a tenant.  However, if a denial  or termination \nof assistance or eviction is required by a Federal statute, based on a particular adverse factor, the Borrower \nmust comply with that statute, even if the adverse factor is a direct result of domestic violence, dating \nviolence, sexual assault, o r stalking. For example, if an applicant is subject to a lifetime registration \nrequirement under a Stat e sex offender registration program, the Borrower must deny the applicant \nadmission, even if the sex offense(s) was (or were) a direct result of the fact that the applicant was a victim \nof domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. \n \nWhere an applicant  or tenant  fails to request  VAWA protections, the Borrower is not independently required \nto identify whether adverse  factors are  the direct  result  of domestic  violence, dating violence, sexual  assault, \nor stalking. Borrowers may seek training, where available, from a trained third-party (such as an expert \nvictim service provider) on reviewing VAWA documentation. Any communications with a third party must \nbe done consistent with the VAWA rule\u2019s confidentiality requirements. \n1.

To trigger the direct  result  analysis,  it is the responsibility  of the applicant  or tenant  to: \n\uf0fc Inform  the Borrower that he or she is a victim of domestic  violence, dating  violence,  sexual \nassault, or stalking: and HB-2-3560 \nAttachment 6 -K    \nPage 7 of 38 ",

After the Borrower receives this information, the Borrower should consider the individual\u2019s \nstatement and any possible  supporting documentation in determining if an adverse factor  was a direct \nresult of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. \n3. If further  information  is necessary  for this determination,  the Borrower  may request  additional \nsupporting documentation from the applicant or tenant. However, any request for additional documentation must:  \n\uf0fc Be in accordance with the Borrower\u2019s  policies  or practices;  \n\uf0fc Not require evidence of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking other \nthan as specified  in 24 CFR 5.2007 (see Section  I \u2013 HUD\u2019s  Forms  and Documentation);  and \n\uf0fc Not violate  the VAWA  confidentiality  requirements  or any other laws.  \n \n4. If the Borrower believes any information is not clear, they should speak to the victim and try to \nclarify the information before making an objectively reasonable determination, based on all the circumstances,  whether  the adverse  factor  is a direct  result  of the fact that the applicant  or tenant  is or \nhas been a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. \n \n2. Examples  of Adverse Factors  That Might  Be a Direct  Result  of Domestic  Violence,  Dating  Violence, \nSexual Assault, Or Stalking  \n \nOn the surface,  adverse  factors  may appear  unrelated  to domestic  violence,  dating  violence, sexual  assault,  or \nstalking and may present legitimate reasons for denial, termination, or eviction. However, the presence of an \nadverse factor may be due to an underlying experience of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, \nor stalking. An adverse  factor may be  present  during much of an abusive  relationship, or it may present  itself \nonly when a victim is attempting to leave, or has left, the abusive relationship. \n \nThe following examples  #1 through #4 are provided to give a sense  of the many  instances  in which  adverse \nfactors might be the direct result of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.

Depending on the circumstances,  temporary failure  to pay rent may be a direct \nresult of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, when domestic violence, \ndating violence, sexual assault, or stalking results in, for example - \n \n\uf0fc The victim\u2019s  injury or temporary incapacitation;  \n\uf0fc The arrest  of the only wage-earning member  of the household;  \n\uf0fc Preventing the victim from  obtaining and/or maintaining  employment;  \n\uf0fc Sabotaging work or employment opportunities  by stalking  or harassing the victim at the \nworkplace;  \n\uf0fc Causing the victim to lose the victim\u2019s  job by physically  battering prior to important \nmeetings or interviews;  \n\uf0fc Placing  utilities  or other bills in the victim\u2019s  name  and then refusing to pay; \n\uf0fc Forcing the victim to turn his or her earnings  over to the abuser;  \n\uf0fc Forcing the victim to work without pay in a family business, Job loss or employment discrimination  due to status  as a victim of domestic  violence,  dating violence,  sexual  assault, \nor stalking; \n\uf0fc Losing wages or a job due to missing work to attend court hearings, seek counseling or \nmedical  care,  or deal with other consequences  of domestic  violence,  dating  violence,  sexual \nassault, or stalking; and \n\uf0fc Inability  to pay bills after significant  medical  expenses  resulting  from  the victim\u2019s \nhospitalization.  \nG.  Ineligibility  for VAWA Protections  \nGuests,  unassisted  members,  and live-in aides  of the family  are ineligible  for VAWA protections  that are \navailable only to tenants and household members.  \n \nAs a reasonable  accommodation, a tenant  can request  VAWA protections  based  on the grounds  that the live- \nin aid is a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. In addition, other \nreasonable accommodations may be needed on a case -by-case basis.  \n \nIn cases  where  a guest  or unassisted  member  is a victim of domestic  violence,  dating  violence, sexual  assault \nor stalking, a tenant cannot be evicted or have assistance terminated on the basis of the domestic violence, \ndating violence, sexual assault or stalking of the guest or unassisted member. \n \nH.  Notification  of Denial,  Termination, and Eviction  \n \nBorrowers  must  notify the applicant  or tenant  if it is found that the denial,  termination,  or eviction  is not on \nthe basis or as a \u201cdirect result\u201d of being a victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or \nstalking, and the applicant or tenant is thus denied admission to, denied assistance under, terminate from \nparticipation in, or evicted from the housing.

(See 24 CFR 5.2007(a)(1).)  \nAn applicant  or tenant  may satisfy  this request  by providing any one of the following documents  as \ndescribed below: (24 CFR 5.2007(b)(1)) \n \n\uf0fc Form  HUD -5382;  or \n\uf0fc A signed document:  \n\uf0fc A record of a Federal,  State,  Tribal,  territorial or local law enforcement  agency,  court, \nor administrative agency (for example, a police report); or \n\uf0fc At the discretion  of a Borrower, a statement or other evidence provided by the applicant  or \ntenant.  \nThe policies should indicate whether a verbal statement will be accepted. The Borrower\u2019s policies \nshould outline  how they will exercise discretion  when  accepting  a statement or other evidence from \napplicants and tenants. \n \nBorrowers  are prohibited from  requiring third -party documentation of victim  status,  except  where \nthere  are conflicting  certifications  or submitted  documentation contains  information  that conflicts \nwith existing information already available to the Borrower.

  "page_440": " \n(07-19-24)  PN 619 \nRevised (06 -13-25)  PN 644  \nGiven  the possible  consequences  to both the victim  and the alleged  perpetrator of domestic  violence, \ndating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, it is important that any allegations made by one \nindividual against another are made with the understanding that there are consequences if the \nallegations  are false.  In this regard, form  HUD -5382  advises  that the submission  of false  information \nmay be a basis for denial of admission, termination of assistance, or eviction. \n \nBorrowers may require submission of documentation within 14 business days after the date that the \nindividual received the written request for documentation. However, the Borrower may extend this \nperiod at its discretion. During the 14-business  day period and any granted extensions  of that time,  no \nadverse actions, such as eviction or termination, can be taken against the individual requesting \nVAWA protection. For example, Borrowers must not schedule an eviction to take place during this \ntime frame. (See 24 CFR 5.2007(a)(2).) \n \nIn determining whether to extend the 14-business day period, Borrowers must consider factors that \nmay contribute to the victim\u2019s inability to provide the documentation in a timely manner. These \nfactors may include, but are not limited to: cognitive limitat ions, disabilities, limited English \nproficiency, absence from the unit due to hospitalization or time in an emergency shelter, \nadministrative delays in obtaining police or court records, the danger of further violence, and the \nvictim\u2019s need to address heal th or safety issues. Borrowers must also grant reasonable \naccommodations  for persons  with disabilities.  Note  that because  of these  factors, the Borrower might \nnot be contacted by the victim with a request to extend the 14-business day period until after the 14- day period has passed.  \n \nd) Acknowledging  Receipt  of Documentation; Failure  to Provide Documentation  in a Timely \nManner  \nOnce a victim provides documentation of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, the Borrower must acknowledge receipt of the documentation in a timely manner. If the \napplicant  or tenant  fails to provide  documentation that meets  the criteria  in 24 CFR 5.2007  within  14 \nbusiness days after receiving the written request for that documentation, or within the designated \nextension period, nothing in the VAWA Final Rule may be construed to limit the authority of the \nBorrower to:  \n \n\uf0fc Deny  admission  by the applicant  to the housing or program;  \n\uf0fc Deny  assistance  under the covered  housing program  to the applicant  or tenant;  \n\uf0fc Terminate  the participation  of the tenant  in the covered  housing  program, or \n\uf0fc Evict  the tenant,  or a lawful  occupant  that commits  a violation  of a lease.  \n \nAn applicant\u2019s or tenant\u2019s failure to timely provide documentation of domestic violence, dating \nviolence,  sexual  assault,  or stalking  does not result  in a waiver  of the individual\u2019s  right  to challenge \nthe denial of assistance or termination, nor does it preclude the individual\u2019s ability to raise an \nincident  of domestic  violence, dating violence, sexual  assault, or stalking at  eviction or termination \nproceedings. If the Borrower denies VAWA protections, they must still follow established appeal procedures, as set forth in 7 CFR part 11. \n \n4.

The form HUD -91067 (Exp. 6/2017 or its successor) \u201cHUD VAWA Lease Addendum\u201d may be \nused or Borrowers  and Management  Agents  may utilize  RD\u2019s  Example  VAWA  Lease Addendum  (Exhibit  B \nof this Guide) for this purpose. Borrowers must be certain that the appropriate VAWA Lease addendum has been signed by all current adult household members. Extra signature lines may be added when needed.

If this results in one of the tenants being \nterminated  from  assistance,  the Borrower must hold a separate hearing for that tenant,  pursuant  to 7 CFR part \n11. \n \nWhen the documentation requirements are satisfied and the question of victim status is resolved, the \nBorrower may not require  further evidence or question whether  the person satisfies  the requirements  for \nVAWA protections. \nNote: Perpetrators sometimes obtain temporary restraining orders or file police reports against victims as a \nform of retaliation. Further, many victims are unable to timely access the courts or law enforcement due to \nlanguage  barriers, disabilities,  cultural  norms, or fear for their safety.  As a result,  the fact that only one party \nsubmitted  third -party documentation is not always  a reliable  indicator  of domestic  violence,  dating  violence,  \n \nsexual  assault,  or stalking.

The Management  Plan  and Borrower\u2019s  VAWA  Policies  and Procedures  \n \nThe Management Plan (HB -2-3560, Attachment 3-A), Tenant Selection Plan (HB-2 -3560, Chapter 6, \nSection 5), and Occupancy Rules must include policies and procedures that educate, protect, support, and \nassist tenants and applicants who are victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking, as well as members  of the household from  being denied  housing and from  losing their assisted  \nhousing as a direct  result of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. The VAWA \nsection of the Management Plan should contain policies and procedures that reflect compliance with VAWA requirements prohibiting the denial of assistance, tenancy, or occupancy rights. \n \nThese policies and rules are critical to informing Borrowers and management agents how to operate daily \nwhile ensuring compliance with VAWA. Borrowers are obligated to undertake whatever actions permissible \nand feasible  to assist  individuals  residing in their units  who are victims  of domestic  violence, dating  violence, \nsexual assault, or stalking to remain in their units or in units of other covered housing providers, and for the Borrower to bear the costs of any transfer, when possible.  \n \nThe VAWA section of the Management Plan must contain protections for victims, such as strict \nconfidentiality of VAWA information, lease bifurcation and emergency transfer. Unit leasing and tenant \nselection policies (HB -2-3560, Chapter 3, Attachment 3-A, paragraph 5) must also include the protection of \nthe rights of tenants and applicants afforded under VAWA. The Borrower\u2019s policies and procedures for \nVAWA may be presented as an annex to the Management Plan and must provide adequate details for the Agency  to effectiv ely monitor  VAWA  compliance,  including a person or position  in the owner's  organization \nthat is the key contact for the management agent regarding VAWA.  \n \nWhen a Borrowers Management Plan does not include the VAWA policies and procedures, or if project \noperations  change  and are no longer consistent  with the current  Management  Plan on file with the Agency, \nan updated Management Plan must be submitted to the Agency, as outlined in HB-2-3560, Chapter 3.3 B.  \n \nThe updated Management  Plan should address  all activities,  objectives,  policies,  or programs  that will enable \na Borrower to serve the needs of child and adult victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual  \nassault, or stalking.

The Emergency  Transfer Plan \n \nBorrowers are required to adopt an Emergency Transfer Plan allowing tenants who are facing actual or \nimminent harm from domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking to make an internal \nemergency  transfer under VAWA when  a safe unit is immediately  available.  A victim determines  whether \nthe unit is safe. (See 24 CFR 5.2005(e)(1)(iii)). \n \nThe Form HUD -5381 may be used for this purpose  or Borrowers may utilize RD\u2019s Emergency Transfer \nProcess  which  is discussed  in paragraph 3 below. Borrowers  must  engage  the victim  in a conversation as to \nwhat they may consider safe or what factors the victim considers unsafe. This may allow the Borrower to \nbetter tailor its emergency transfer response.  \n \nThe Emergency Transfer Plan must identify tenants who are eligible for an emergency transfer, whether \ndocumentation is needed and what type of documentation is needed from a victim to request an emergency \ntransfer, confidentiality  protections, how an emergency  transfer may occur, and guidance  to tenants  on safety \nand security.

If a \nproperty is fully occupied and after checking the  RD MFH  Rentals website  the Borrower is unaware  of other \nvacant  units  in the area,  Borrowers  must  use their best effort  to support  victims  in finding a safe place to live. \n(See Section S - Developing Partnerships with Victim Service Providers ) \n \nThe Emergency Transfer Plan should also make clear that qualifying for an emergency transfer does not \nguarantee continued assistance under the current program or an external transfer to another covered housing \nprogram. The emergency transfer requirements do not supersede any eligibility or occupancy requirements \nthat may apply under a  covered housing program. This means that  even if a  tenant  at Property A is eligible  to \nrequest an emergency transfer, the tenant cannot move into Property B if the tenant does not meet the \nprogram  eligibility  requirements  at Property B. For example,  if a tenant  qualifies  for an emergency  transfer at \nProperty A to escape an abusive partner, but the tenant does not meet the program eligibility requirements at Property B (must be a disabled person or age 62 at a Section 515 Elderly property), the tenant cannot be \nrehoused at Property B under that program.  \n \nThe Borrower\u2019s  Emergency  Transfer  Plan may require  documentation from  a tenant  seeking  an emergency \ntransfer, pursuant to 24 CFR 5.2007(b)(1). When a Borrower requires documentation from the tenant, the \nrequest for documentation must be submitted to the tenant in writing.  The Emergency Transfer Plan must \nspecify whether verbal statements, self-certification, or a written request from the tenant is sufficient to \ninitiate an emergency transfer. If a verbal statement, self-certification or written request is needed, it shall \ninclude:  \n\uf0fc A statement that the tenant requests an emergency transfer because he, she, or a household member reasonably believes  that there  is a threat  of imminent harm  from  further violence  if the tenant  were to \nremain in the same dwelling unit, or  \n\uf0fc A statement that the tenant requests an emergency transfer because the tenant was a sexual assault victim and that the sexual  assault  occurred during the 90-calendar  day period preceding the tenant\u2019s \nrequest for an emergency transfer.  \nIf revisions  to existing  policies  are necessary  to facilitate  emergency  transfers, Borrowers  should consider  the \nfollowing when making the needed revisions:  \n\uf0fc Availability  and location  of units  under current  ownership;  \n\uf0fc Demand  by applicants  for assistance under the program;  \n\uf0fc Frequency of mandatory or emergency  transfers;  and \n\uf0fc Availability  of alternative  housing  opportunities.  \nBorrowers must also comply with state specific VAWA laws which may provide additional requirements for \nemergency  transfer policies,  such as a requirement  to create an admissions  preference for victims  of domestic \nviolence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking.

The Emergency Transfer  Plan must allow a tenant to make an internal emergency transfer under \nVAWA when  a safe unit is immediately  available. The plan must also describe policies  for assisting  tenants \nwhen a safe unit is not immediately available. Those policies must ensure that requests for internal \nemergency transfers under VAWA receive, at a minimum,  any applicable  additional priority that Borrowers \nmay already provide to other types of emergency transfer requests. \nOften  Borrowers will not have a unit which  is immediately  available  and/or that the victim determines  is safe \nwithin the same property or in another building that is part of the same scattered site property. The Borrower \nmust have a policy to assist the tenant in obtaining a safe unit within the property once one becomes available. If the Borrower has an internal transfer waiting list, the victim should be placed on that list. The \nBorrower\u2019s policy should state whether or not the Borrower will give priority to victims of domestic \nviolence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking on their internal transfer waiting list. This is the Borrower\u2019s choice. \nIf a safe unit is  not immediately  available,  the Borrower must,  at the same  time,  offer the tenant  assistance in \nmaking  an external transfer. The Borrower and  victim should discuss why an internal transfer is  not viable at \nthat time and what external transfer options are available based on the Emergency Transfer Plan. \n2. External Transfers  \n \nAn external  emergency transfer refers to a tenant\u2019s physical move out of the RD property in which  he or she \nresides to a property where the tenant would be categorized as a new applicant. A VAWA LOPE from the \nAgency may be used for this purpose. For example, a move from Property A to Property B is an external \ntransfer \u2013 this also means that the household goes from being a tenant at Property A to an applicant at Property B with priority placement in an available unit or on the waiting list over all other applicants. \n \nBorrowers are required to make reasonable efforts to assist a tenant who requests to make an external emergency transfer when  a safe unit at the current property is not immediately  available. Borrowers are \nstrongly encouraged but are not required to research available units and/or arrange for the move. \nA Borrower\u2019s reasonable efforts should include providing contact  information for relevant  local  service \nproviders, government agencies, and other affordable housing developments in the area. \n \nBorrowers must  consider the following when  creating their external  emergency transfer policies:  \n\uf0fc Making available  a list of similar  assisted  housing options in an area requested by the victim.  A \nhousing search can be completed on RD\u2019s MFH Rentals website here RD MFH Rentals .\n  \n\uf0fc Making arrangements including memoranda of understanding, with other local  affordable Borrowers \nto facilitate moves.  \n \n\uf0fc Conducting outreach  activities  to organizations that assist  or provide resources to victims  of domestic \nviolence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking (see Section T \u2013 Additional Resources). \n\uf0fc Creating an admissions preference for victims seeking an external emergency transfer from another \ncovered housing provider. This would allow a victim to more quickly access an available unit \nadministered  by a RD Borrower without being placed on the bottom of an applicant  waiting  list.

RD\u2019s Emergency Transfer Process  \n \nRD\u2019s Emergency Transfer Process requires a VAWA Letter of Priority Entitlement (LOPE) from the \nAgency. A VAWA LOPE entitles existing RD tenants to receive priority over all other applicants for \navailable housing at any Section 515 Rural Rental Housing or Section 514 Farm Labor Housing property, \nanywhere in the United States, if the victim otherwise meets the normal RD program eligibility criteria in \naccordance with 7 CFR 3560.152 and 7 CFR 3560.576(b), respectively. The priority under VAWA does not \ndepend on income and apartment size, except applicants with a LOPE will be ranked among themselves by \nincome level, giving priority first to very low-income households, then to low-income households, and \nfinally to moderate-income households. \n \nThis letter may also help the victim receive preference in a non -RD financed apartment if permitted by the \noccupancy policy  of the non-RD financed program. RD\u2019s  VAWA LOPE  should be issued  upon satisfaction \nthat a tenant has certified as an actual or imminent victim of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. (See HB-2-3560, Chapter 6.16(C) and 6.20.) \nTenants facing  actual  or imminent harm  should contact the property manager, or if the property manager \ncannot be contacted  due to safety  concerns because of the inappropriate conduct of the property manager \nor an employee at the property, the local MFH RD office may be contacted directly by the victim, or by \na local service provider or domestic violence or sexual assault agency that could contact the local MFH RD office to request an emergency transfer. The property manager shall \nprovide the victim with the \nVAWA Notice of Occupancy Rights (form HUD-5380) and may request written Certification (fo rm HUD - \n5382) or other acceptable type of documentation, when required, certifying to an incident.  \nUpon determination by the property manager that a tenant has met the eligibility criteria for an emergency  transfer  (see Section  N) the property manager shall  immediately  contact their assigned  MFH \nServicing  Official.  The MFH  Servicing  Official shall  provide  the VAWA LOPE  to the tenant indicating \nat a minimum, the specific benefits that are being provided and that the tenant may receive priority placement in an available RD unit within given timeframes.  \n \nAfter the VAWA LOPE  has been  issued,  the appropriate HUD forms  have been  received  and completed \nwhere required, and a new unit has been located that was deemed safe by the victim, the transfer is permitted to occur.  \n \nTenants  who receive a LOPE  and are beneficiaries  of Rental  Assistance  (RA) may transfer their RA to \nanother RD property.  \n \nStrict confidentiality  measures  must  be exercised  by Borrowers  and management agent  staff at all times. \nVAWA records, communications and the location of the new dwelling must not be disclosed to the person that commits an actual or \nimminent act of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or \nstalking .

Processing  an Emergency  Transfer  Request  \n \nAn Emergency Transfer request must be made by the existing tenant facing actual or imminent harm from \ndomestic  violence,  dating  violence,  sexual  assault,  or stalking.  The Emergency  Transfer  must  be processed  in \naccordance with the Borrower\u2019s Emergency Transfer Plan, which should be thoroughly and clearly set forth in the Management Plan.  \n \nBelow  is a basic  example  of an emergency  transfer, although there  may be additional  circumstances  involved \nthat could affect the manner in which it is processed. \n \nExample:  \n \nScenario:  A tenant  approaches  property management  staff, informing them that they are a  victim of dating \nviolence  and fearful  of further violence. The household consists  of the  victim  (head  of household) and  two \nchildren under the age of 18. \n \nStep 1: The management agent provides the victim with the VAWA Notice of Occupancy Rights (Form \nHUD -5380) and Certification  (Form  HUD -5382) if not previously provided to ensure  that they understand \nthe rights and protections afforded them. \nStep 2: The victim requests an emergency transfer either verbally or in writing, depending upon the \nmanagement  agent\u2019s  policy. The management  agent  can accept  the victim\u2019s  verbal  statement of the incident \nor may request a Certification form or other documentation per 24 CFR 5.2007. \n \nStep 3: The management  agent  exercises  confidentiality  while  working with the victim  and informs  him or \nher of options as set forth in the Emergency Transfer Plan.  \n \n1. Internal  Transfer:  \nA safe unit is not immediately  available at the current  property. The management  agent  offers  to put \nthe victim on an internal transfer waiting list. Because a safe unit is not immediately available, the \nmanagement agent also explains external emergency transfer options.  \n \n2. External  Transfer:  \nThe management  agent  should offer RD\u2019s  Emergency  Transfer Process  and a VAWA LOPE.  A list \nof RD rental properties with Rental Assistance may be obtained using RD MFH Rental Properties  \nwebsite.  Borrowers may obtain the number of available RA units for each RD project listed in the \nlocal area from their assigned MFH Servicing Official. \nThe management  agent  should also provide  a list of non-RD  rental  units  for which  the Borrower has \nagreed to partner with and other local organizations serving victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking. There may be victim service providers locally that may have \nresources such as safety planning, counseling, and emergency funding. The management a gent \nprovides the victim with contact information. \nStep 4: The victim decides  to forgo the external  transfer  and stay in the current  RD housing unit until he or \nshe is able to secure another housing unit. The management agent must take steps to reduce the threat of \nfurther violence against the victim. Examples include changing the victim\u2019s locks (pursuant to the  HB-2-3560 \nAttachment 6 -K    \nPage 24 of 38 ",
  "page_451": " \n(07-19-24)  PN 619 \nRevised (06 -13-25)  PN 644 Borrower\u2019s  lock replacement  policy  and state and local  laws);  installing  better  lighting  around the perimeter \nof the building and reminding the victim that he or she is allowed temporary absence from the unit in \naccordance with the Borrower\u2019s policies. \n \nStep 5: An assisted  unit becomes  available  at the current  property. The management  agent  notifies  the victim \nof the availability of a unit and provides a tour of the unit. \n \nStep 6: The victim determines  the unit to be safe. The management  agent  expeditiously  follows  its policies \nfor the internal transfer.  \n \nN.  Eligibility  for An Emergency  Transfer \nThe Emergency  Transfer  Plan must provide  that a tenant  who is a victim  of domestic  violence,  dating \nviolence, sexual assault, or stalking, qualifies for an emergency transfer if:  \n \n1. The tenant  expressly requests  the transfer;  and \n2. Either  \u2013 \n\uf0fc The tenant  reasonably believes  that there  is a threat  of imminent harm  from  further violence  if the \ntenant remains within the same dwelling unit, or  \n\uf0fc In the case of sexual assault, the tenant reasonably believes there is a threat of imminent harm \nfrom further violence if the tenant remains within the same dwelling unit that the tenant is \ncurrently occupying, or the sexual  assault  occurred during the 90-calendar  day period preceding \nthe date of the request for transfer. (See 24 CFR \u00a7 5.2005(e)(2))  \nO.  Lease Bifurcation  \n \nIn accordance with 7 CFR 3560.159(d)  and 24 CFR 5.2009(a),  management  agents  may bifurcate  a lease (or \nremove a household member or lawful occupant from a lease) in order to evict, remove, or terminate \noccupancy rights of a household member who engages in criminal activity directly relating to domestic \nviolence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking against an affiliated individual or other individual. Typically, a victim must be a tenant or an adult household member to request a bifurcation of the lease. \nLease bifurcation is not the appropriate  remedy  to remove  a person living  in the unit who is not on the lease \nand who is not a tenant. \n \nEviction  or termination  of a victim\u2019s  assistance  under  the actual  and imminent threat  provision should occur \nonly when there are no other actions that could be taken to reduce or eliminate the threat, including, but not \nlimited to, transferring the victim to a different unit, barring the abuser from the property, contacting law \nenforcement to increase polic e presence or develop other plans to keep the property safe, or seeking other \nlegal remedies to prevent the abuser from acting on a threat. \nEviction,  removal, or termination  of occupancy  rights  shall be  carried  out in accordance with  HB-2-3560, \nChapter 6.30  and as prescribed by the  Federal, State, or local law \nthat provides the greater protection  for \nvictims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking.  \n \nVictims should consider temporarily moving to a safe, confidential location until the bifurcation process is \ncompleted.  Once the process  is complete,  ask the landlord to change  the locks.  To avoid unnecessary  delay  in HB-2-3560 \nAttachment 6 -K    \nPage 25 of 38 ",

This process results in the underlying lease becoming null and void \nonce  the management  agent  regains  possession of the unit. The management  agent  would then execute a new \nlease with the victim.  \n \nManagement  agents  should simultaneously  attempt to reach  agreement  to the mutual termination  of the lease, \nif it is safe to do so.  \n \n1. Reasonable  Time  to Establish  Eligibility  Following  Lease  Bifurcation  \n \nVAWA establishes  a reasonable  time period for a remaining  household member(s) to demonstrate  eligibility \nfor housing assistance or find alternative housing following the lease bifurcation. \nThe management  agent  must provide  to the remaining household member(s) a minimum period of 90- \ncalendar days from the date of lease bifurcation to:  \n\uf0fc Establish  eligibility  for the same  housing program  that aided  the evicted  or terminated  tenant;  \n \n\uf0fc Establish  eligibility  under another covered  housing  program;  or \n \n\uf0fc Find alternative  housing.  \n \nThe management agent is encouraged to allow an additional 60-calendar day extension when needed. In \naddition, the 90-calendar  day period and any extension thereafter  will not apply  beyond the expiration of a \nlease.  \n \nIn seeking a lease bifurcation, management agents must not subject victims to more demanding standards \nthan other applicants. When the remaining household members are unable to establish eligibility, such as \nwhen  the removal  of the abuser  leaves  the family  with no member  who can qualify, a qualified  adult  may be \nadded to the household to serve as the head of household as outlined in HB-2 -3560, Chapter 6.28 D \n\"Remaining Household Members.\"  \nAs a result  of a lease bifurcation, it may be necessary  to transfer the existing  household to an appropriate  unit \nsize in accordance with the  lease.  In some  cases, the lease bifurcation may result  in a change  in tenant  rent or \nthe Tenant Contribution. The management agent must ensure the remaining tenant is provided the proper notice of increase as outlined in HB-2 -3560, Chapter 7.4 G and in accordance with local and State laws. \n \nManagement  Agents  should  perform  an Interim  Recertification  for the remaining  household members  at the \ntime of the lease bifurcation. Any modification of the rent payment for the remaining household members \nmust be done during the 90-calendar day period. The Interim Recertification should be carried out in \naccordance with HB -2-3560, Chapter 6.26 B.  \n \nIf the remaining family member will not be able to establish eligibility, the household is not eligible to receive  \nsubsidy. In this case,  the remaining  family  member  must then pay market  rent for the duration of the 90-\ncalendar day period or move -out, whichever comes first.

Family  Break -Up Example  \nThe occurrence of domestic  violence, dating  violence, sexual  assault,  or stalking  may lead to the break -up of \nthe assisted family. Family break -up involves terminating the assistance of the perpetrator while continuing \nthe assistance to the victim, ensuring that the victim understands his or her rights, documenting the abuse, \nmaintaining the confidentiality of the victim, and ensuring the safety of the victim. \nChanges to a family\u2019s composition must be reported to the management agent in accordance with the terms \nof the lease. The lease includes a requirement that the tenant transfer to an appropriate size dwelling unit \nbased on family composition, upon appropriate notice by the management agent that such a dwelling unit is \navailable. Management  agents must follow the lease  and their written  internal transfer waiting  list policies  in \ntheir Tenant Selection Plans in instances where the change in family composition would require that the \nfamily move to another unit of appropriate size. (See HB-2-3560, Chapter 6.28 D). \n \nTo help understand each of the steps  involved with this process, this Guide presents  the following scenario:  \n \nNote: The example below provides a scenario that is fact intensive. Real-world cases of victims seeking VAWA protections must be approached in a way that takes  in consideration the specifics  of each case and is \naddressed pursuant to program requirements and management policy. \n \nExample  \nA victim informs the management agent that his or her family member is committing domestic violence, \ndating violence, sexual assault or stalking against him or her, and he or she wishes to retain tenancy. The \nvictim may choose to inform the management  agent  of the abuse after the management  agent  has notified the \nhousehold that it is being evicted (due to criminal activity, for example), or at any other point. \n \nStep 1: If the management agent previously has not provided notification to the family members of their \nVAWA rights, then in accordance with 24 CFR 5.2005(a)(2), the management  agent  must provide notice  to \nthe victim of his or her VAWA rights.  If he or she has been previously notified of his or her VAWA rights, \nthe management agent must again provide the victim with the VAWA Notice of Occupancy Rights and \nCertification form, to ensure that he or she fully understands the rights and the protections afforded him or \nher. \n \nStep  2: The management  agent  can decide to accept  the victim\u2019s  statement or provide the victim a written \nrequest for documentation per 24 CFR 5.2007. \n \nStep 3: Upon provision of documentation (if requested and provided as specified in 24 CFR 5.2005(7)), the \nmanagement agent should ensure the victim knows of the upcoming notification of eviction of the perpetrator, including the exact  date the notification  will take place. As part of this notification  to the victim, \nthe management  agent  should give the victim contact  information for local victim service providers to allow \nthe victim an opportunity to create a plan of action (e.g., the victim may need to leave the unit temporarily and stay in a domestic violence shelter until the eviction takes place). The management agent is obligated to \nutilize any partnerships it may have established with local law enforcement and victim service providers to \nensure the safety of the victim. \n \nStep  4: The management  agent  begins the process to evict  the perpetrator. If the victim wants  to move out of \nthe unit for his or her safety, the management agent must first determine if the tenant qualifies for an HB-2-3560 \nAttachment 6 -K    \nPage 27 of 38 ",

If the victim wants to stay in the unit, the \nmanagement  agent  bifurcates the lease  by evicting  the perpetrator and allowing  the victim and the remaining \nhousehold members to remain on the lease. The management agent must expeditiously conduct an Interim Recertification to determine the new rent computations. The management agent should refer to HB-2-3560, \nChapter 6.26 B for the requirements of processing an Interim Recertification when there is a change in family composition.  \n \nStep 5: The management agent should provide the perpetrator with no more than 30 days (in most cases) \nnotice of termination (24 CFR 247.4(c)). If the perpetrator requests a hearing, the management agent is \nencouraged to conduct an expedited hearing within  no more than 10 days following the effective date of the \nnotice.  \n \nThe perpetrator has a right to examine  the management  agent\u2019s documentation relevant  to the eviction.  This \nmeans the perpetrator has a right to examine the relevant documentation the victim provided, claiming VAWA protections. This documentation is required for use in an eviction proceeding or hearing regarding \ntermination of assistance from the covered housing program. (This is an exception to the victim\u2019s \nconfidentiality rights, per 24 CFR 5.2007(c)(2)). To protect the victim\u2019s safety, any information tha t would \nreveal the location of the victim, or the location of any services that the victim is receiving must be \nmaintained  confidentially  (i.e., redacted from the shared documentation), unless it meets  the exception in 24 \nCFR 5.2007(c)(2)(ii). \nManagement  agents  should consult a local  domestic  violence expert or victim  service provider (that has not \nworked with either the victim or perpetrator), to be on the grievance hearing panel. The hearing officer or \nhearing panel provides the perpetrator with a written decision. \n \nStep  6: If it is determined  that the perpetrator did indeed  commit  the acts, the case will then be moved to \neviction court. \n \nStep  7: If the eviction  process is upheld, the management  agent  processes the Interim Recertification  to \nremove the household member and completes the bifurcation of the lease agreement. \n \nP.  Termination of the Victim  Due to \u201cActual and Imminent Threat\u201d and Any Violation Not Premised  \non an Act of Domestic Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Assault, or Stalking \nVAWA prohibits denial  of admission  or assistance,  termination  of assistance,  or eviction  on the basis  or as a \ndirect result of the fact that the applicant or tenant is or has been a victim of domestic violence, dating \nviolence, sexual assault, or stalking. However, nothing in the VAWA Final Rule may be construed to limit \nthe authority of a management  agent  to evict  or terminate  assistance for any violation  not premised  on an act \nof domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or stalking that is in question against the tenant or an affiliated individual of the tenant. (See 24 CFR 5.2005(d)(2)) \n \nIn addition, nothing in the VAWA Final Rule may be construed to limit the authority of the Borrower or management  agent  to terminate  assistance or evict  a tenant  if the management  agent  can demonstrate that an \nactual  and imminent threat  to other tenants  or those employed at or providing services  to the property would \nbe present if that tenant or lawful occupant is not evicted or terminated from assistance.

  "page_465": "HB-2-3560 \nCHAPTER 7:  RENTS, SHELTER COST, AND \nUTILITY ALLOWANCES  \n7.1   INTRODUCTION  \nThe purpose of the low interest rate loans that the Agency makes is to enable borrowers \nto set rents at rates that are affordable to low - and moderate -income tenants, the target occupants \nfor Agency- financed multi -family housing.  Rents provide the necessary income stream to \nmaintain and operate the housing.  Thus, the Agency has a twofold interest in maintaining the \nrent streams in multi -family housing to protect the value of the property at affordable rates.  \nThis chapter presents the program rules regarding rents, occupancy charges, and utility \nallowances for multi -family housing projects and the Agency\u2019s procedures for determining \nborrower compliance, including those for Farm Labor Housing projects.  After re ading this \nchapter, the MFH Servicing Official will understand the various types of project rents and how \nthey are set, how rents are to be paid by tenants and collected and reported on by the borrower, and the procedure for changing rents in a project.  T hey will also learn how security deposits are \nset and when they may be collected.  \nThe Agency defines \u201crent\u201d as the amount established as a charge for occupancy in a \nrental unit of Agency- financed multi -family housing.  Rents must be established at the same rate \nfor all similar units in the housing project: basic or note rent plus the ut ility allowance (when \nused) or the occupancy charge plus the utility allowance.  If the utility costs are included in the rent, the rent will equal shelter costs.  \nUnless otherwise noted, for purposes of this discussion the term \u201crents\u201d refers to both \nrents and occupancy charge, and \u201ctenants\u201d refers to both tenant and members of a cooperative.  \nSECTION 1:  RENT REQUIREMENTS  \n7.2   RENT REQUIREMENTS BY PROJECT TYPE [7 CFR 3560.202]  \nA.  Major Rent Levels  \nSubject to Agency approval, borrowers set project rents and utility allowances based \non debt service and reasonable operating and maintenance expenses.  Projects will have one or more of the following four rents:  \n\u2022 Note rent  is the rental charge established to cover expenses in the housing project\u2019s \napproved budget and the required loan payment set at the interest rate shown in Form RD 3560- 52, Promissory Note.  \n\u2022 Basic rent  is the rental charge established to cover expenses in the housing project\u2019s \napproved budget and the required loan payment contained in Form RD 3560- 52 \nreduced by the interest credit agreement.  \n7-1 \n(07-19-24)  PN 619 ",
  "page_466": "HB-2-3560 \n\u2022 U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) contract rent  is the \nrental charge established for housing receiving project- based HUD Section 8 rental \nsubsidies in accordance with 24 CFR Part 880 or Part 884, as applicable.  \n\u2022 Low- income housing tax credit (LIHTC) rent is the rental charge established in \naccordance with LIHTC requirements.  \nB.  Rent Levels by Project Type \nThese rent levels will apply depending upon the project type as follows:  \n\u2022 Plan I projects, direct and full -profit projects with loans made prior to 1968, and \nunrestricted Farm Labor Housing projects all have rents that are note rate only.  \nTenants all pay the same rent depending upon the size of their unit.   \n\u2022 Plan II projects have a minimum rent that is the basic rent and a ceiling rent that is the note rate rent.  Tenants without rental subsidies (see Chapter 8, Rental Subsidies, for details) pay a rent within that range, based on their incomes.  Tenants with rental assistance pay the basic rent, although the rental subsidy may pay all or a portion of the rent on behalf of the tenant.  \n\u2022 HUD Section 8 projects with interest credit have a minimum basic rent, a maximum note rate rent, and a HUD rent.  \n\u2022 HUD Section 8 projects without interest credit have a note rate rent and a HUD rent.  \nExhibit 7 -1 summarizes the rents that appear in each project type.  \nExhibit 7 -1 \nRents by Project Type  \nProject Type  Rents  \nPlan I projects  Note rent  \nPlan II projects  Note, basic  \nSection 8/515 projects without interest credit  Note rent, HUD contract rent  \nSection 8/515 projects with interest credit  Note rent, basic rent, HUD contract rent  \nEarly projects (pre -1968, direct loan and full \nprofit projects)  Note rent  \nLabor housing \u2014On Farm  No rent or note rent  \nLabor housing \u2014Off Farm  Note  \nCongregate housing/group homes  Note rent, basic rent  \nCooperatives  Note rent, basic rent  \n7-2 \n  ",

Setting Rent Levels  \nRents are set by unit size and established by the borrower through a project budget at \nlevels adequate to cover debt service, reasonable project operating expenses, and a return \nto owner if appropriate.  Initial rents and any changes must be approved by the Agency as part of the project budget approval process.  Chapter 4 addresses procedures for determining whether project budgets are reasonable.  \n7.3   UTILITY ALLOWANCES [7 CFR 3560.202]  \nWhen tenants pay some or all of their utility costs themselves, borrowers must establish a \nutility allowance to determine the amount tenants pay toward rent.  The utility allowance is deducted from the total shelter cost calculated for the tenant, and the difference is paid by the tenant as rent.  If the tenant is entitled to a utility reimbursement, management companies may issue a joint check payable to the tenant and utility company, if they choose to do so.  \nA.  Setting Utility Allowances  \nThe utility allowance is based on expected costs for utilities that are paid by the \ntenants .  Once established, the borrower must review the utility allowance annually.  This \nis done in conjunction with the annual budget process.  The borrower must submit Form RD 3560- 7, Multiple Family Housing Project Budget/Utility Allowance to the Agency \nand follow the procedures described in Section 4 of this chapter.   \nB.  Approving Utility Allowances  \nMFH Servicing Officials  must review the utility allowance documents submitted with \nthe budget to make sure that the numbers being used are reasonable and comparable to other projects in the same market area.  The MFH Servicing Official should check current rate schedules and known rate increases from such sources as suppliers of electric utility, natural gas utility, water and sewer service, fuel oil and bottle gas; public service commissions; real estate and property management firms; and state and local agencies, \nincluding public housing authorities.  In addition, the MFH Servicing Official should \ncheck project budgets of any other Agency- funded projects in the area to see if utility \nallowances are similar.  Chapter  4 provides further guidance on revising cost increase \njustifications.  \nC.  Monitoring Utility Allowances  \nTo make sure that borrowers are correctly applying utility allowances, servicing staff \nmust check tenant leases during supervisory visits of projects where tenants pay their \nown utilities.  These leases should reflect the current utility allowances as show n on the \ncurrent approved budget for the project.  \n7-3 \n(07-19-24)  PN 619 ",

Note Rents  \nIn projects with note rents only, tenants will pay the note rent, regardless of income, \nunless they are income ineligible, in which case they will pay a surcharge.  \nWhen a Plan II project is experiencing severe vacancies due to market conditions, the \nAgency may allow the borrower to charge a Special Note Rent (SNR) to attract or retain \ntenants whose income level would require them to pay note rent.  An SNR is less tha n the \nnote rent but is higher than the basic rent.  The requirements for requesting and receiving an SNR are established under 7 CFR 3560.454. \n2.  Basic Rents  \nIn projects with basic and note rents, tenants will pay their net tenant contribution, but \nno less than the basic rent and no more than the note rent.  \n3.  Rental Assistance Rents  \nTenants who are eligible to receive available rental assistance in a project pay the net \ntenant contribution.  Rental assistance makes up the difference between the net tenant \ncontribution and approved shelter costs (basic rent).  Chapter 8 provides further details on charging and collecting rents from tenants with rental assistance.  \n4.  HUD Section 8/USDA Section 515 Rents  \nIn projects with HUD Section 8 housing assistance contracts, HUD sets the rents and \nutility allowances and tenants pay the borrower rent the total tenant payment (TTP), which is the greater of: 30 percent of monthly adjusted income or 10 percent of gross income; welfare rent or; $25.  The HUD rent should never be less than the basic rent.  If \nit is, the borrower must make up the difference, since it cannot be collected from the tenant.   \n5.  Tenant -Based Subsidies  \nTenants with tenant -based subsidies such as HUD vouchers pay the rents established \nat the project.  If the voucher is less than the project rent, the tenant is responsible for the difference.   \nC.  Overage  \nOverage is that portion of a tenant\u2019s net \ntenant contribution that exceeds basic rent up to note rent.  Full overage is an amount equal \nExample  \nJimmy Smits pays $180 a month in \nrent, which is 30 percent of his adjusted \nmonthly income.

Surcharge for Ineligible Tenants in Plan I Projects  \nIneligible tenants occupying a Plan I project must pay the established note rate rent \nplus a rent surcharge of 25 percent of the established rent.  A Plan I project is defined in \n7 CFR 3560.11. \n2.  Income -Ineligible Tenants in Plan II Projects  \nIncome -ineligible tenants occupying Plan II projects must pay the note rate rent.

Unit Rents for Site Managers, Caretakers, and Owner- Occupied Units  \nWhen used as a revenue producing unit at approved rental rates, the salary paid to \nthe site manager and/or caretaker will be included in the project operation and \nmaintenance expenses. The same amount will be included in the annual income of the site manag er and/or caretaker. The site manager and/or caretaker may be an eligible or \nineligible tenant and their rent contribution will be based on their total income from all sources as shown on the tenant certification form.  \nWhen the unit is used as a non -revenue producing unit, the project cost of \nproviding the unit will be treated the same as those of other non -revenue producing \nportions of the project. Project rental rates will be established as if the unit did not exist as living quarters. Debt payment will be as if the units were  rented at basic rent. A tenant \ncertification form will not be prepared for this situation.   \nWith prior approval of the  Leadership Designee, an owner may occupy a unit in \nthe project when the owner will manage the project rather than hiring a management \nagent or site manager.

Setting and Collecting Rents  \nUnit rents in projects with LIHTCs will be set in accordance with regular Agency \nprogram rules.  Two examples of setting such rents are provided in Exhibit 7- 3.  The \nAgency must be aware that the LIHTC program prohibits owners from charging tenants \nmore than a certain amount of rent in LIHTC units.  Borrowers who do this risk recapture of their tax credits and stiff penalties.

One- bedroom apartment:  basic rent = $275, LIHTC rent = $250.  \nThe expense level required to meet financial requirements of the project exceeds the rent \nallowed to be charged by the low -income housing LIHTC program by $25.  \nExample 2 :  Assume a project where LIHTC rent is equal to or greater than the basic rent, \nand a previously eligible tenant\u2019s household income increases beyond the LIHTC rent.  In this case, the tenant may or may not have previously received rental assistance or HUD \nSection 8.  Example:  One -bedroom apartment:  basic rent = $250, LIHTC rent = $300.  \nOnly one co-tenant works.  Hou sehold pays $200 per month and rental assistance is $50.  \nHousehold is Agency and LIHTC eligible.  Second co-tenant goes to work, causing the \nhousehold rent to go up to $350.  The new rent level exceeds both basic and LIHTC rents.  \nOverage of $100 is due.  LIHTC rent limitations require that the owner charge tenants no \nmore than $300, which causes a shortage of $50 per month in overage due the Agency.  Therefore, the owner is accountable for this shortage if the project was allocated LIHTCs \nprior to 1991.  For projects allocated LIHTCs after 1990, the owner is allowed to collect \nthe overage due from the tenants because gross rent that tenants pay in the LIHTC unit \ndoes not include any rental payment to the owner of the unit to the extent such owner pays \nan equivalent amount to the Agency under Section 515.  The tenant cannot be required to \nmove based on LIHTC ineligibility.  \n \n2.  Agency Review and Monitoring of LIHTC Rents  \nThe law does not excuse the borrower from paying the basic rents required to the \nAgency; these rents must be deposited into the operating account in full. Borrowers must \nbe informed by the Agency that the borrowers are responsible for funding any gap \nbetween basic rents and tax credit rents collected from tenants when basic rent exceeds LIHTC rents.  This fact should be noted when the MFH Servicing Official  reviews the \nproject operating budget. \nBorrowers must not use project funds to make up any difference between rents \nrequired under Agency program rules and the maximum allowed rents under the LIHTC program, and they must collect the required rents. During the annual review process, MFH Servicing Officials  should review the previous year\u2019s budget with a focus on any \ncash shortfalls.  If the MFH Servicing Official determines that a shortfall exists due to differences between tax credit limitations and basic rents, they must ensure that a provision is made in the coming year\u2019s budget and future years on line 11, \u201cCash- non \nproject\u201d of Form RD 3560- 7 for the owner to contribute necessary funds to meet the \nrequired rents.  \n7-9 \n(07-19-24)  PN 619 ",

Adjustments to Unit Rents  \nBorrowers must adjust net tenant contribution and unit rents, if applicable, whenever \nthere is a change in tenant household status sufficient to generate a new certification in \naccordance with 7 CFR 3560.152.  Borrowers are not required to recertify a hous ehold \nprior to the annual recertification unless a change in household income of $100 or more per month occurs.  If a tenant requests it, the borrower must recertify the tenant for a change in household income of $50 or more per month (see Chapter 6 for further details on interim recertifications).  \nA change in household status could take place in any one of the following \ncircumstances:  \n\u2022 The tenant has had a change in income (increase or decrease);  \n\u2022 The tenant has had a change in the size of the household (increase or decrease in number of people residing in the unit); or  \n\u2022 The tenant has had a change in the type of household (the household may become \nhandicapped or elderly, or a 17- year-old child may turn 18).  \nIf Form RD 3560- 8 shows that a change in rents is in order as a result of the change \nin household status, the effective date of a tenant\u2019s changed rent is the first day of the \nmonth following third -party verification of the tenant\u2019s reported changes.

  "page_486": "HB-2-3560 \n SECTION 4:  RENT CHANGES  \n7.12   OVERVIEW  \nAll borrowers, including those using HUD Section 8 contract assistance, must obtain \nprior Agency approval for a rent increase. Changes in rental rates will apply to all units in a \nproject.  Rent change requests for multi -family housing projects with no HUD  subsidy are \ntypically submitted and reviewed at the same time the borrower submits their annual budget for approval.  Rent changes in Section 8/515 projects resulting from rent increases by HUD must also be reviewed and must not automatically be approved.  For any project, only the amount of rent necessary to cover project expenses must be approved.  This section covers rent changes in projects without HUD subsidies, then changes in projects with HUD subsidies.  \n7.13   CHANGES IN RENTS AND UTILITY ALLOWANCES [7 CFR 3560.205]  \nIt may be necessary as operating costs and/or revenues in a project fluctuate for the \nborrower to request Agency approval to effect a rent change.  Exhibit 4 -1 shows the timeline for \nborrower submission and Agency review of rent change requests.  This proc ess is also described \nin Chapter 4. \nA.  Rent Change Requests under Special Circumstances  \nThe MFH Servicing Official may accept borrower requests for rent or utility \nallowance changes at times other than with the annual budget submission under special circumstances where a change is necessary to preserve the financial integrity of a project and the financial distress is due to circumstances beyond a borrower\u2019s control.  Such circumstances might be in the event of a natural disaster or when work -out procedures are \nnecessary.  \nWhen a Plan II housing project is experiencing severe vacancies due to market \nconditions, the Agency may allow the borrower to charge a special note rent (SNR), which is less than note rent but higher than basic rent, to attract or retain tenants whose income level would require them to pay special note rent. The requirements for receiving \nan SNR are established under 7 CFR 3560.454. \nB.  Annual Utility Allowance Reviews  \nThe borrower should review tenant paid utility allowances on an annual basis to \ndetermine whether any changes have to be made.  The borrower should indicate no \nchanges to utility rates in the comment section of the budget narrative.  \nC.  Tenant Notification and Comments  \nAt the same time the borrower submits the initial notice to the Agency that they \nintend to submit a rent change request, the borrower will send or deliver notices to each tenant in the project notifying them of the rent change request that will be submitte d to \nthe Agency with their annual budget.  Appendix 4  provides an example of such a notice.  \n7-22 ",
  "page_487": "HB-2-3560 \n The borrower must also post this notice in a common area frequented by the tenants, such \nas the laundry room or near the mailboxes. \nThe notice must notify tenants that they have 20 days  to provide their comments to \nthe Agency.  If during this time the Agency receives any tenant comments, these must be immediately forwarded to the borrower, with the identity of the tenant protected.  This can be done by either paraphrasing the comments for the borrower or by removing any identifying information from the correspondence received from the tenant and forwarding it on to the borrower.  \nAfter the 20 -day comment period, the Agency must notify the borrower of approval \nor rejection within 10 days . If the Agency approves a rent or utility allowance increase \nrequest where  comments were solicited, tenants should be notified of the rent or utility \nallowance change that will take effect at least 30 calendar days from the date of the \nnotification.  \nD.  Documentation  \nThe borrower must fully document any rent change request.  Requests for a rental \ncharge change must be based on a realistic projected budget for the interim year or the ensuing full year.  The borrower must provide to the Agency the information identified in Exhibit 7 -8 with the rent or utility allowance change request.  \n \n  \n7-23 \n(07-19-24)  PN 619 \n  ",

Form RD 3560 -7 must be used to reflect the project\u2019s financial needs for the year \nand thereby rental charge requirements. A narrative cover letter must be included \nexplaining why the rent change is necessary.  A new operating budget for the fiscal year must show:  \n\u2022 Currently approved budget at old rents;  \n\u2022 Proposed budget at proposed new basic rents; and  \n\u2022 Proposed budget at proposed new note rate rents (if applicable).  \n2. Actual utility costs .  Refer to Chapter 4 for a description of the information required \nto document utility allowance change requests.   \n3. Additional documentation .  Additional documentation must be attached to  \nForm RD 3560-7  in accordance with the instructions to these forms as evidence of \nthe need for the rent or utility allowance change.   \n4.   Other information .  Any other information the borrower believes is necessary to \njustify the proposed shelter cost change.  \nThe narrative attached to the budget form must clearly explain the necessity for the \nchange request and the MFH Servicing Official must analyze the supporting \ndocumentation to the budget and Form RD 3560 -7 to see if it supports the request.  For \nexample, if the rent increase is due to increased taxes, then the MFH Servicing Official  \nshould look for copies of tax increase notices in the budget documentation.  If the rent \nincrease is due to an increase in general operating expenses, the MFH Servicing Official must review those expenses for reasonableness. Chapter 4 discusses reasonableness and how a budget should be reviewed for acceptability. \nE.  Agency Responsibility  \n1.  Reviewing the Rent Change Request  \nWhen the borrower submits a budget with a rent or utility allowance change request, \nthe Agency must respond to the borrower within 60 days .   If the Agency does not contact \nthe borrower, the borrower may assume that any rent change request of $25 or less has \nbeen automatically approved.    \n2.  Circumstances in which the Agency Will Not Approve a Rent Increase \nThe MFH Servicing Official must not approve a rent increase under the following \ncircumstances:  \n \n7-24 \n ",

Such a condition is established when the project budget shows that income meets expenses at current r ent \nlevels.  \n\u2022 The project is operated on a profit basis, and the rent change would result in rents higher than what tenants can afford.  This condition is established by comparing rents with 30 percent of tenant adjusted incomes.  If it is shown that tenants would be paying in excess of 30 percent of their adjusted incomes as new rents and the increase \nis not necessary to meet projected costs, then the increase must not be approved.  \n3.  Rejection of Rent Change Request  \nIf the MFH Servicing Official rejects the change request, the borrower must be \nnotified and be provided with appeal rights.  \n4.  Effective Dates of Change  \nThe effective dates of any approved changes will coincide with the start of the \nproject\u2019s fiscal year or the start of the season for labor housing projects.  For a  request of \na rent/utility  allowance change  on which comments were solicited , tenants should be \nnotified of the rent or utility allowance change, that will take effect at least 30 calendar \ndays after  the date of the notification .  \nFor notices to tenants, see Appendix 4 . \n7.14   RENT CHANGES FOR UNITS RECEIVING HUD SECTION 8 ASSISTANCE  \n[7 CFR 3560.207]  \nThe Agency has the responsibility to review and approve project budgets on an annual \nbasis based on need to meet cash flow and expense requirements.

When this occurs, in accordance with Exhibit 7- 9, \nthe borrower must deposit the difference between the Agency approved note rate rent and \nthe higher HUD -authorized rate into the reserve account.  The manager or borrower must \nuse Form RD 3560- 29 to document the required deposit in the reserve account.  \nIf excess HUD rents accumulate in the reserve account beyond the sum shown in the \nborrower\u2019s loan agreement or resolution, the Agency may reduce or cancel the interest credit on the project.  The Agency may reinstate interest credit whenever HUD rent should become lower than the Agency note rate rent.  \nBefore depositing excess funds in the reserve account, the borrower may have to \ncollect overage. Whether overage is collected and a project is subject to cancellation of interest credit depend upon the issuance date and execution date of the project\u2019s interest credit agreement.  \nCertain early versions of the interest credit agreement do not have a legal basis to \nsupport the Agency\u2019s policy to cancel interest credit or collect overage to offset interest credit.

  "page_494": "HB-2-3560 \n CHAPTER 8:  RENTAL SUBSIDIES  \n8.1   INTRODUCTION  \nRental subsidies are deep subsidies that enhance the affordability of rents in a project.  \nEach year, the Agency has available a limited number of Agency -funded rental assistance units \nthat can be allocated to new or existing Agency- financed multi -family housing projects.  The \nAgency also encourages the use of non\u2013Agency rental subsidies in multi -family housing projects \nas a way to reduce tenants\u2019 rents.  \nBecause rental subsidies are limited, it is important that they be allocated to borrowers \nand distributed to tenants in a fair and equitable manner.  Consequently, the Agency has \ndeveloped rules that must be followed in the distribution and administration of rental subsidies.  This chapter presents the program rules and procedures for allocating and administering rental subsidies in multi -family housing projects, including Farm Labor Housing projects.  It covers not \nonly Agency- funded rental assistance, but  U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development \n(HUD) and other types of subsidies as well.  \nFor purposes of this chapter, the term \u201ctenant\u201d also means \u201cmember,\u201d and \u201crental \nassistance\u201d is reserved for use in describing Agency -financed rental subsidy. \n8.2   AUTHORIZED RENTAL SUBSIDIES [7 CFR 3560.252]  \nA.  Project -Based Rental Subsidies  \nThe Agency may authorize the use of project -based rental subsidies in addition to \ninterest credit for multi -family housing projects.  These rental subsidies may take the \nform of:  \n\u2022 Agency -funded rental assistance.   This is a project -based subsidy program available \nto very low - and low -income tenants in Agency- financed multi -family housing.  \n\u2022 HUD Section 8 assistance.   This project -based subsidy is administered by HUD and \nwas used extensively with Agency- financed housing from the mid- 1970s to the early \n1980s. \n\u2022 Private rental subsidy.  This is a subsidy program whereby the project owner(s) or \nothers enter into an agreement with the Agency to provide and fund subsidy to tenants of the project on approximately the same basis as the Agency -funded rental assistance \nprogram.  In some instanc es, the agreement may include a limit on the number of \nunits and a per -unit ceiling on the amount of assistance.  \n\u2022 State or local rental subsidy.   Such subsidy is provided and funded by some states \nand available to borrowers to assist tenants on approximately the same basis as the Agency rental assistance program.  The assistance is in the form of a contract between the borrower and the state and has the Agency\u2019s concurrence.  \n__________________________________________________________________________________________  \n8-1 \n(07-19-24)  PN 619 ",

Tenant -Based Rental Subsidies  \n\u2022 RD Vouchers supplement the tenant\u2019s rent payment when the mortgage is paid off prior to the maturity date in the promissory note.  This includes foreclosed properties. Tenants in these properties may be  eligible for an RD Voucher that may be used at \nany other rental unit in the United States or its territories that :  \n\uf0a7 passes an RD inspection , and \n\uf0a7 the owner will accept an RD Voucher .  \n\uf0a7 RD Vouchers cannot be used for  subsidized rental units , such as USDA Section \n521 Rental Assistance, HUD Section 8 , or with other programs  where two \nhousing subsidies would result.  \n\u2022 HUD Section 8 Vouchers may be accepted by borrowers in Agency- funded multi -\nfamily housing.  These subsidies are administered by HUD or others authorized to administer the program such as a State Housing Finance Agency or the local public housing agency.  P rojects accepting tenants who use such vouchers assigned by a \nlocal public housing agency will also comply with any requirements imposed by that agency.  \nC.  Multiple Subsidies  \nMore than one type of subsidy may be used in a project. The rental subsidy that the \ntenant is receiving must be less than the full amount of Agency rental assistance for which the tenant would qualify.  In such cases, the Agency may provide the difference \nbetween the subsidy received by the tenant and the amount of Agency rental assistance \nfor which the tenant qualifies.  \n\u2022 Tenants with subsidies from sources other than the Agency may be eligible for Agency rental assistance if all of the following conditions are met : \na. The tenant qualifies for Agency rental assistance.  \nb. The rental subsidy the tenant is receiving is not a HUD voucher.  \nc. The rental subsidy being received by the tenant is less than the full amount of Agency rental assistance for which the tenant would qualify.  \nThere are special tenant codes under Part II, item 6 of the electronic MFIS Tenant \nCertification to denote what types of subsidy, if any, a tenant is receiving, and whether the tenant is receiving full or partial subsidy from a source other than the Agency . \n_________________________________________________________________________________________  \n8-2 \n  ",
  "page_496": "HB-2-3560 \n SECTION 1:  ALLOCATION OF AGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE  \n8.3   AGENCY- FUNDED RENTAL ASSISTANCE  \nThe objective of the Agency rental assistance (RA) program is to reduce rents paid by \nlow-income households.  RA is the portion of approved shelter cost (rent and utilities) paid by \nthe Agency to the borrower on behalf of a tenant to compensate for the dif ference between the \napproved shelter cost and the monthly tenant contribution as calculated on Form RD 3560- 8, \nTenant Certification .  When the household\u2019s monthly gross tenant contribution is less than the \napproved utility allowance that is billed directly  to and paid by the tenant, the owner will pay the \nhousehold that difference. \nIf a prospective tenant with a HUD voucher or other subsidy applies for occupancy and \nthe project has RA or project -based subsidy, the RA or project -based subsidy may take priority .  \nThe management plan or criteria for selecting tenants/members for occupancy may identify RA \npriority assignment .  RA may only be provided to tenants who are income eligible and residing \nin eligible units. There are four types of RA:   \n\u2022 Renewal RA is RA that replaces RA agreements contracts expiring because the \nobligated funds under the agreement have been fully disbursed.  Because the Agency wishes to protect tenants currently benefiting from RA, replacement of RA contracts receives  first priority for funding from the Agency.  \n\u2022 Servicing RA  is RA that increases the number of RA units in a project resulting in an \ninitial RA agreement or an amendment to an existing agreement with a borrower.  \n\u2022 New construction RA  is RA to accompany new units of multi -family housing.   \n\u2022 Incentive RA is RA that is used to help preserve multi- family housing projects as \npart of the prepayment process.  For information about the prepayment process, see \nHB-3-3560, Chapter 15.  \n8.4   ALLOCATION AND DISTRIBUTION OF AGENCY RA [7 CFR 3560.257]  \nA.  Allocation of RA by the Agency   \nRA is allocated on an annual basis by the Agency\u2019s Asset M anagement  Division  and \nin an amount based on Congressional appropriations.

Second priority will be for RA to accompany new construction.  \n\u25ca RA units will be allocated to those projects that are selected for funding under the \nNotice of Funding Availability (NOFA) system and in accordance with the scoring and ranking system described in Chapter 4 of HB -1-3560. \n\u25ca For farm labor housing projects, RA units will be allocated by the National Office \nfrom the National Office reserve on a case- by-case basis at the time the projects \nare considered for funding at the National Office level.  \n\u2022 Servicing assistance.

The project must meet the requirements specified \nin Section 8.5. \n\u2022 Does the project need the RA?  The supporting documentation from the borrower \nmust show that there are tenants or applicants who are eligible for the RA.  \n\u2022 Is the RA available for distribution?  There must be  RA units /funding available.  \nHow an RA request gets processed depends upon whether the assistance is for \nreplacement RA, servicing RA, or new construction RA. \nA.  Renewal and Servicing Rental Assistance  \n1.  Tracking Usage of Agency -Funded RA  \nThe Agency reviews RA payments and obligations status  for each project.  This is \ndone quarterly and annually.  The Agency monitors  RA payments and obligations in \nconjunction with the Automated M ulti-Family Housing Accounting System (AMAS) to \nensure maximum utilization of existing RA obligations.  If it is determined that RA units are not being used, the procedures in Section 8.8 should be followed to transfer the units.  \n2.  Processing Renewal RA  \nRenewal RA must not award more units  than necessary to cover existing expiring \ncontracts.  For example, if a 24 -unit project has only 18 units of RA that are expiring, the \nLeadership Designee may not award the project more than 18 units of RA. \n8-5 \n(07-19-24)  PN 619 ",

HUD Section 8 Housing Assistance Payments  \nFor properties that receive project -based HUD Section 8 assistance, borrowers must \nprovide copies of their Housing Assistance Payments (HAP) contracts to the MFH Servicing Official.  The MFH Servicing Official must monitor these contracts, \nparticularly their expiration dates.     \n4.  Servicing RA  \nBorrowers apply for servicing RA by checking a box on the project budget \nForm  RD 3560- 7, indicating a need for servicing units and certifying that they have \nlooked elsewhere for other rental subsidies.  To allocate servicing units to a project, the MFH Servicing Official must verify that the project is eligible and:  \n\u2022 Existing tenants are paying more than 30 percent of their incomes in rent; or  \n\u2022 There are vacancies in the project and evidence that shows that there are very low - \nincome tenants who would occupy the housing if there were RA units available.  \nSuch evidence must be in the form of market data and/or waiting lists.  \nB.  New Construction Rental Assistance  \nNew construction RA is requested with the initial application. The following \nrequirements must be met for the Agency to consider awarding new construction RA:  \n\u2022 The number of RA units requested must be based on the market data for the area, the \nproposed rental rates as reflected in a budget for the project, and the income levels of \nthe prospective tenants; and \n\u2022 If the RA is going to be part of a project funded by a participation loan, the Agency participation rate needs to be at least 25 percent of the total development cost.  \nChapter 4 of HB -1-3560 provides further details on processing new construction RA. \nC.  Special Language for FY 2004, 2005 & 2006 RA Obligations.  \n      The FY 2004, 2005 and 2006 appropriation language has established a set term of \nfour years for RA Obligations, only.

Due to an Unclosable Loan  \nWhen RA will be unused because the loan to which it was obligated will not be \nclosed or the RA agreement is not signed, the RA obligation may not be transferred  \nexcept when the circumstances allow for the funds to finance the project to be transferred as well. However, if this situation occurs during the same fiscal year of obligation, the obligation must be canceled and reallocated immediately using current authorities.

Rents  \nTenants receiving RA must pay the net tenant contribution toward rent, which will \nnot exceed the higher of:  \n8-18 \n ",

Utilities  \nThe utility allowance for a project with RA is determined as it is for any other project.  \nAs for non\u2013 RA projects, the utility allowance is reviewed annually for accuracy and \nchanges are made when necessary.  \nWhen the tenant is billed directly for utilities, rent paid by the tenant receiving RA \nwill be the difference between the established utility allowance and the net tenant contribution as determined by 7 CFR 3560.203. \n\u2022 Example:  Assume a basic rent of $250 and a utility allowance of $50.  Patty Duke\u2019s \nadjusted monthly income is $400.  Thirty percent of her adjusted income is $120.  Fifty dollars is deducted from the $120 to allow her to pay her utilities, leaving her a net tenant contribution of $70 for rent to the borrower.  The Agency pays RA to the borrower on behalf of Patty Duke in an amount of $180 to total the $250 basic rent.  \nWhen utilities are paid by the household receiving RA and the net tenant contribution \nis less than the allowance for utilities, the borrower will pay the household the difference between the utility allowance and net tenant contribution.  \n\u2022 Example:  Assume a basic rent of $250 and a utility allowance of $50.  Jane Ronda\u2019s \nadjusted monthly income is $160.   Thirty percent of her adjusted monthly income is $48, which is less than the utility allowance.  The Agency will pay $252 in RA to the borrower to cover the $250 basic rent and the extra $2 that the borrower must provide to the tenant to allow her to meet the $50 utility allowance.  \nIn a project where the borrower pays all utilities, the tenant rent will be the net tenant \ncontribution as per 7 CFR 3560.203 up to the approved rent for the rental unit being occupied.  \n\u2022 Example:  In a project where the basic rent is $300 and there is no utility allowance, RHS would pay the borrower $180 for Patty Duke, who would pay the whole $120 in rent, totaling the required rent payment of $300.  For Jane Ronda, the Agency would pay $252 to the borrower in RA and Ms. Ronda would contribute her $48 to make the total $300 rent payment.  \n \n \n8-19 \n(07-19-24)  PN 619 \n  ",

By using operating assistance to reduce operati ng costs, rental rates \ncan remain lower so that they are affordable to tenants based on the average wages of migrant farmworkers in the area.  Tenants in Off- Farm Labor Housing projects that are receiving \noperating subsidy are still required to provide inc ome verification and household income must be \nwithin the very -low or low -income limits to qualify for reduced operating assistance rents.  \nBorrowers must provide documentation of tenant incomes to the Agency.    \n8.15   PROJECT ELIGIBILITY FOR OPERATING ASSISTANCE  \nOnly Off -Farm Labor Housing project units that are designated for migrant farmworkers \nare eligible to receive operating subsidy.

To ensure that borrowers meet these responsibilities, the Agency monitors borrower performance and takes action as needed to see that borrowers fulfill their responsibilities.  The previous chapte rs have described the program requirements for multi -family housing projects \nand the Agency\u2019s procedures for implementing these requirements. This chapter describes the Agency\u2019s procedures for monitoring multi -family housing projects to ensure that these \nrequirements are met.  \nSection 1 of this chapter provides an overview of Agency monitoring activities.  Section \n2 describes the procedures for Servicing Offic ials\u2019 monitoring activities.  Section 3 discusses \nmonitoring farm labor housing projects for compliance with program requirements.

However, to make the \nbest use of its available resources, the Agency will give priority in its monitoring efforts \nto borrowers with projects that have the greatest risk of poor performance or compliance violations.  By focusi ng more attention on projects experiencing problems, the Agency \ncan maximize the effect of its monitoring activities.  Agency monitoring efforts involve three levels of activities:  \n\u2022 Routine monitoring.   For projects with limited risk of performance or compliance \nproblems, MFH  Servic ing Officials  will conduct routine monitoring.  This level of \nmonitoring involves regular checks of project compliance through reviews of regular borrower submissions and periodic on- site visits.  \n\u2022 Intensive monitoring.   For projects with a higher risk of performance or compliance \nproblems, MFH  Servic ing Officials  will conduct intensive monitoring.  This level of \nmonitoring involves not only regular checks of project compliance, but also more frequent borrower reporting and on- site visits by Agency staff.  \n\u2022 Quality control.   While MFH  Servic ing Officials  conduct routine and intensive \nmonitoring, Leadership Designees are responsible for oversight of MFH Servicing \nOfficials  monitoring efforts.  The Agency  will establish a set of goals for MFH \nServicing Officials performance.  Leadership Designees will  use Multi -Family \nHousing Information System (MFIS), Automated Multi -Family Housing Accounting \nSystem (AMAS), and other monitoring reports to ensure that MFH Servicing Officials  are meeting these goals.  Additional oversight of performance is conducted \nthrough the Internal Compliance Review (ICR) process.  \n9.3   BORROWER RESPONSIBILITIES  \nBorrowers are responsible for cooperating fully with the Agency staff performing \nmonitoring activities.  The Agency will notify borrowers in writing of any deficiencies or compliance violations identified during its review.  Borrower must address these deficiencies within the correction period established by the Agency and described in the notice.  \n  \n9-2 \n  ",

USDA Staff  \nEffective monitoring of borrower performance requires a coordinated effort on the \npart of Agency staff from several areas.  While MFH  Servic ing Officials  hold primary \nresponsibility for monitoring borrowers and their projects, staff from other offices will often assist in performing monitoring reviews.  For example, Program Support Staff (PSS)  such as  Architects /Engineer s may assist when MFH  Servic ing Officials  have \nspecific concerns about a project. When performing reviews of the central office of a manag ement agent with properties in several states, MFH  Servic ing Officials  will need to \ncoordinate with their counterparts from other servicing staff .  Finally, if monitoring \nactivities identify significant deficiencies, MFH  Servic ing Officials  will often need to \nobtain the advice of staff from OGC.  \n2.  Borrowers, Management Staff, and Tenants  \nWhile the Agency holds responsibility for performing monitoring activities, effective \nmonitoring also requires the cooperation of the borrower and their management agent  or \nrepresentative .  Their involvement during monitoring reviews is needed to provide access \nto records and to answer questions about project operations and procedures.  Further, when deficiencies are discovered, the borrower, as well as the management agent, need to \nbe informed so that prompt action can be taken to correct the problem.  Bor rowers \nnotified of deficiencies are responsible for ensuring that the problems are corrected and for keeping the Agency informed about actions taken to address the problems.  \nTenants are important participants in the monitoring process because they can provide \nvaluable information about project operations.  \n9-3 \n(07-19-24)  PN 619 ",

As discussed in previous chapters, program requirements vary depending on the type of project and the type of financing the borrower received.  The case file (ECF) documents indicate the type of project and the specific terms of the Agency\u2019s financing.  For example, these documents specify the replacement reserve requirements and the owner\u2019s return on investment.  The case file (ECF) also contains the management certification and management plan, which provide key information about project operations. \nAgency records include the automated systems used to administer the program.  \nAMAS and MFIS contain information that aid in monitoring projects.  \n      Official records contain legal evidence of all transactions between the Agency and the persons with whom it conducts business.

MFH  Servic ing Officials  examine these records during \nmonitoring reviews to evaluate project performance and compliance.  \n3.  Other Sources  \nIn addition to site visits conducted by MFH  Servic ing Officials  or other staff to \nobserve project operations, the Agency also draws on other sources to inform monitoring \nactivities.  Substantiated reports by tenants or community members noting inadequate conditions or improper practices are examples.  Reports of perfor mance problems in \nother states involving the same borrower or agent are also a source of concern.  This type of information does not necessarily confirm that a problem is present, but indicate s a \nneed for further review of a project\u2019s operations.  \n9.5   PLANNING MONITORING ACTIVITIES  \nPlanning monitoring activities involves scheduling routine reviews and \ndetermining the extent to which in -depth monitoring needs to be conducted. MFH  \nServic ing Officials  and Leadership Designees should review annually their plan to \nmonitor their portfolio.  Exhibit 9 -2 indicates the reviews that are performed routinely \nand those that are in -depth reviews.  \nA.  Routine Monitoring  \nEach year, MFH  Servic ing Officials  must schedule routine monitoring reviews.  \nThese activities\u2014 together with the regular program administration activities performed \nby MFH  Servic ing Officials \u2014ensure that all projects receive a basic level of oversight \neach year to check for evidence of deficiencies or potential problems.  \nIn scheduling these activities,  Leadership Designees need to ensure that the \nappropriate staff is available to perform these reviews.  Annual physical reviews should be planned to coincide wherever possible with other activities that take staff to the vicinity of the projects.  In cases where access to indi vidual units is required for \ninspection, the borrower will be required to provide adequate notice to the tenants.   \nB.  In -Depth Monitoring  \nWhen planning monitoring activities for the year, MFH  Servic ing Officials  must \ndetermine which projects warrant in -depth reviews and the types of reviews needed.  In-\ndepth reviews are done periodically to check for continued project compliance.  These reviews are also performed more frequently for projects experiencing distress or when there is clear evidence of compliance concerns.  \n9-6 \n  ",

Desk Reviews  \nDesk reviews are usually performed solely by the MFH  Servic ing Official and require \nlittle coordination with other staff.  Performing these reviews generally involves three \nbasic steps:  \n\u2022 Preparing and reviewing background material.   MFH  Servic ing Officials  should \ngather the project case records  and assemble past reports and other relevant records.  \nIn addition to reviewing these documents, MFH  Servic ing Officials  should review the \nrelevant screens in AMAS and MFIS to gain an up -to-date understanding of the \nproject\u2019s status and potential concerns. \n\u2022 Examining the borrower\u2019s monthly and quarterly reports.  MFH  Servic ing \nOfficials  then review the borrower\u2019s monthly or quarterly reports following the \nspecific instructions in Section 2 of this chapter or using the instructions that accompany the Agency\u2019s review form. MFH  Servic ing Officials  must make every \neffort to complete the review within the established time period.  If additional information is needed to complete the review, MFH  Servic ing Officials  will promptly \ncontact the borrower to request additi onal information.  \n\u2022 Notifying borrower of any findings.  If the review reveals deficiencies or \ncompliance violations, the borrower must be promptly notified.  The notice must \ndescribe the deficiencies and a period for corrective action.  If a third party is involved in financing or providing subsidy to the property and a formal arrangement exists with this third party, the Agency will provide a copy of the notice to the third party source to share information concerning the Agency\u2019s findings.  \nRefer to Chapter 4 of this Handbook for details concerning financial reports.   \nB.  On -site Reviews \nOn-site reviews take more preparation and planning than desk reviews.  MFH  \nServic ing Officials  must follow the four steps below when performing on -site reviews.  \nThe actions at each step will vary depending on the type of review.

The following paragraphs provide a brief description of how the Agency views the classification of the portfolio.  \nLoans may be reclassified in MFIS as findings and violations are determined or as project \nconditions improve.  \nCLASS D PROJECTS  \nClass D projects are in default and may be taken into inventory, be lost to the program, or \ncause the displacement of tenants.  Defaults can be monetary or non -monetary.  For information \nabout monetary and non- monetary defaults, please refer to HB -3-3560, Chapter 10.  \nProjects in non -monetary default are those where a Loan Servicer has notified the \nborrower of a violation using the Agency\u2019s three processing letter process, as described in this chapter, and the borrower has not addressed the violation to the Loan Service r\u2019s satisfaction \nwithin 60 days  of the first servicing letter.  The Loan Servicer, State Office, and National Office \nshould be aware that the project is in jeopardy and should be available to provide further servicing assistance.  \nCLASS C PROJECTS  \nClass C projects are projects with identified findings or violations , which are not \nassociated to a workout plan and/or t ransition p lan.  They include projects with violations where \nHandbook Letter 301 (3560)  has been issued but 60 days  have not passed.  It is important to note \nthat while the presence of a finding or violation is a normal occurrence in portfolio management, Loan Servicers will be concerned when findings and violations are carried for an extended period of time with no in dication of resoluti on efforts.  Projects under this classification for an extended \nperiod of time will alert Loan Servicers to one or more of the following:  \n1. There may be workload or staffing issues related to resolving problems;  \n2. Findings may need to be elevated to violations to facilitate effective servicing; and  \n3.

When MFH Servicing Officials  are experiencing difficulties with \nlitigation officials or when the loan is part of a long -term work -out agreement, the \nNational Office should be contacted for assistance.  \nA number of long- term delinquencies are the result of inactive accounts with loan \nbalances remaining after the asset is liquidated (i.e., foreclosure, sale, or transfer for less than the debt, compromise offer, bankruptcy, etc.). These accounts need to be settled due to their negative impact on the overall multi- family housing delinquency rate.

In the second \nsituation, a party may desire to receive notice of and perhaps participate in an appeal \nbecause of the derivative impact the appeal determination will have on that party, e.g., guaranteed lenders and reinsurance companies. The provisions in this section set forth rules for the participation of such third and interested parties.  \n (a) Third parties. When an appeal is filed, the Division shall notify any potential third party whose rights may be adjudicated of its right to participate as an appellant in the appeal. This includes the right to seek Director review of the Hearing Officer determination. Such third parties may be identified by the Division itself, by an agency, or by the original appellant. The Division shall issue one notice to the third party of its right to participate, and if such party declines to participate, the Division determination will be binding as to that third party as if it had participated. For purposes of this part, a third party includes any party for which a determination of the Division could lead to an agency action on implementation that would be adverse to the party thus giving such party a right to a Division appeal.  \n \n \n \n \n \n___________________________________________________________________________ \n(07-19-24)  PN  619 ",

Should a review of SDOL data reveal a substantial discrepancy, you will have to contact the tenant household to solicit added information to explain any discrepancies, abuses, or to correct any errors.  The goal is not to harass tenants but merely to resol ve \nmisunderstandings and errors as early as possible.  The Agency's program will not usually look at past tenant certifications or recover any improper subsidy which may have been delivered in years past unless there is evidence of substantial abuse and th e amount \nof the past unauthorized assistance exceeds $1,000.  Upon receipt of this notice, you should take steps to inform tenants of the wage and benefit matching initiative.

Review the lease agreement, application and other documentation used by the \nborrower to determine if policies and procedures represent barriers to occupancy. \n 5.   Review the self -evaluation plan and transition plan and compare the physical \ninspection to determine if there are barriers present that were not addressed or scheduled to be removed.  \n 6.  Where transition plans are scheduled to remove barriers over more than a one- year \nperiod, review the transition plan and the most recently approved budget to assure that borrower budgeting and the projects financial condition is supportive of the trans ition plan as written. Transition plans should include the potential cost of \nremoving identified barriers.  \n  ",

Is the International Symbol of Accessibility (ISA) required to be on a MFH project \nsign?  \n \nNo.  However, borrowers are encouraged to include the ISA on the project sign if:  \n \n\u2022 There are no physical barriers for someone wishing to inquire or apply for a service or \nbenefit, and  \n\u2022 The project has an accessible route to fully accessible units.  \n 2.   Is the Telecommunication Device for the Deaf (TDD) number required to be on the \nproject sign?  \n \nWhen project management communicates with hearing impaired applicants or tenants, they must use either a TTD or an \u201cequally effective communication system.\u201d If a borrower uses a TTD number, the TTD number must be on the project sign. If a borrower uses an equally effec tive \ncommunication system, the borrower must document the process in their self- evaluation and let \nthe public know how this is to be accomplished. However, the borrower is not required to post the relay service phone number on the project sign. Borrowers w ith Section 8/515 projects are \nrequired by HUD to use a TTD.  \n 3.   Are assistance animals that assist the disabled subject to MFH project \u201cPet\u201d rules?  \n No. They are permitted occupancy under the Fair Housing Act and are defined as follows:  \n \u2022 Assistance animals are not pets.  These are animals that work, provide assistance, or perform tasks for the benefit of a person with a disability, or animals that provides emotional support that alleviates one or more identified symptoms or effects of a person\u2019s disability.  Assistance animals \u2013 often referred to as \u201cservice animals,\u201d \u201csupport animals,\u201d \u201ctherapy animals\u201d or \u201ccompanion animals\u201d perform many disability -related \nfunctions including but not limited to (1) guiding individuals who are blind or have low vision, (2) alerting individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing to sounds, (3) providing minimal protection or rescue assistance, (4) pulling a wheelchair, (5) fetching items, (6) alerting persons to impending seizures, or  (7) providing emotional  support to persons \nwith disabilities who have a disability -related need for such support.  \n  \u2022 A borrower may not refuse to allow a person with a disability to have an assistance animal merely because the animal does not have formal training.  Some, but not all, animals that assist persons with disabilities are professionally trained.  The owners themselves train other assistance animals and, in some cases, no special training is required.  The question is whether or not the animal performs the disability- related \n ",
  "page_631": "HB-2-3560 \nAppendix 5  \nPage 12 \n \n assistance or provides the disability -related benefit needed by the person with the \ndisability.  \n\u2022 A borrower\u2019s refusal to modify or provide an exception to a \u201cno pets\u201d rule or policy to \npermit a person with a disability to use and live with an assistance animal would violate Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Fair Housing Act unles s: \n \n1. The animal poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others that cannot be \nreduced or eliminated by a reasonable accommodation,  \n 2. The animal would cause substantial physical damage to the property of others,  \n 3. The presence of the assistance animal would pose an undue financial and \nadministrative burden to the provider, or  \n 4. The presence of the assistance animal would fundamentally alter the nature of the \nprovider\u2019s services.  \n \n\u2022 The fact that a person has a disability does not automatically entitle him or her to an assistance animal.  There must be a relationship between the person\u2019s disability and his or her need for the animal.  \n \u2022 A borrower may not require an applicant or tenant to pay a fee or a security deposit as a condition of allowing the applicant or tenant to keep the assistance animal.  However, if the individual\u2019s assistance animal causes damage to the applicant\u2019s unit o r the common \nareas of the dwelling, at that time, the borrower may charge the individual for the cost of \nrepairing the damage if the provider regularly charges tenants for any damage they cause to the premises.  \n 4.  Does an applicant needing special design features have priority for occupancy over a current tenant without a need for the special design features of a fully accessible unit?  \n Yes. While tenants without a need for the special design features may occupy a fully accessible unit, prior to occupancy the tenant must agree to move to another unit in the project if a qualified individual needing the special design features applies for occupancy of the fully accessible unit.  Borrowers are required to enter into a lease agreement with the tenant without a need for the special design features to assure that a legal right exists to require the tenant to move to another available unit in th e project, when necessary.  \n 5.  What are a few suggestions to improve marketing of fully accessible units?  \n Before fully accessible units are rented to persons not in need of the special design features, borrowers must conduct a diligent and documented marketing effort to ensure that those in need of the special design features know about the availability for th e units. Such contacts may \nInclude, Area Commission on Aging, Physical Rehabilitation Centers, Hospitals and Disabled Veterans Organizations. Borrowers are encouraged to use the handicap accessibility logo as a marketing tool on the project sign, in advertising, and on contact letters, leaflets and brochures. \n \n ",
  "page_632": "  HB-2-3560 \n  Appendix 5  \n  Page 13 \n \n__________________________________________________________________________________________  \n(07-19-24)  PN 619 When a tenant not needing the design features occupies a fully accessible unit, borrowers are to \ncontinue their marketing efforts until a tenant needing the design features is found.  \n 6.  How do borrowers meet 7 CFR 15b numerical requirements for fully accessible units?  \n \nIn MFH projects ready for occupancy after June 10, 1982, 7 CFR 15b standards require:  \n \n\u2022 At least 5 percent or one unit, whichever is greater, must be fully accessible. To meet the 5 percent minimum, borrowers must round up to the next whole unit. For example, a 24-unit MFH project must have at least two fully accessible units (8.3 percent) rather than one (4.2 percent).  \n \u2022 Fully accessible units must be comparable in variety to other project units. For example, in a 24- unit project with 12 one -bedroom units and 12 two- bedroom units, one of the \nfully accessible units should be a one -bedroom unit and the other should be a tw o-\nbedroom unit. \n \u2022 Rents for fully accessible units must be comparable to other same sized project units.  \n \u2022 If a project has more than one site, fully accessible units may not be clustered at one site, unless only one fully accessible unit is required.  \n \u2022 When a project has a wide variety of units (one, two, three or four bedrooms), borrowers are not required to exceed the 5 percent requirement simply to have a fully accessible unit of each type. \n 7. On-farm Farm Labor Housing is normally a single -family house.   Is this housing \nsubject to the 5 percent fully accessible requirement?  \n No.  The 5 percent requirement appears in 7 CFR 15b.41.  This section of the regulation only applies to multi -family rental housing. The Office of the General Counsel (OGC) provided an \nopinion on its application to a single unit Farm Labor Housing because 7 CFR 15b does not define \u201cmulti -family.\u201d  OGC advised us that we may use the definition in Uniform Federal \nAccessibility Standards (UFAS), which defines multi -family housing as any \u201cbuilding containing \nmore than two dwelling units.\u201d  (For more information  on UFAS, refer to www.access-\nboard.gov/ufas/ufas -html/ufas.htm ).  Therefore, \u201con- farm\u201d labor housing that consists of \nbuildings with less than three units, is not required to meet the requirement that 5 percent of the \nunits be constructed as fully accessible units.  However, borrowers should be mindful that if a request is made for a \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d, that they must address accessibility at t hat \ntime.  \n 8. Who pays for reasonable accommodations?  \n ",
  "page_633": "HB-2-3560 \nAppendix 5  \nPage 14 \n \n If an eligible applicant or tenant makes a request for a reasonable accommodation, borrowers are \nto use project resources to complete and pay for the accommodation.  A borrower may request a waiver from the Secretary of Agriculture if they can show that th e modifications or other special \naccommodations needed by the person with a disability would cause an undue financial/administrative burden or fundamental change in operations. The borrower must prove \nsuch a burden exists in order to receive a waiver from the Secretary.  \n \n9. What type of reasonable accommodation is made?  If an eligible applicant or tenant makes a request for a reasonable accommodation, the change to be made should be based on the tenant\u2019s assessment of their needs, even when the accommodation may vary from commonly accepted accessibility standards. All improvements should be done in a professional manner and meet local building code requirements.  \n 10. When is it appropriate to make inquiries about a person\u2019s disability?  \n An appropriate question for all applicants to an elderly MFH project is:  \n \u2022 \u201cIf you are less than 62 years old, are you eligible for occupancy based on your status as an individual with handicaps or disabilities?  \n Regarding the issue of adjustments to income or priority for a unit with special design features, the application form should give the opportunity to make a request for the added benefit. For example, it would be appropriate to ask all applicants and tenants:  \n \n\u2022 \u201cDo you wish to have priority for an apartment with special design features for persons with disabilities?\u201d  \n \u2022 \u201cDo you wish to claim a $400 deduction from your income based on a disabling condition?\u201d  \n By phrasing questions in this manner, applicants are advised of the benefit and allowed to decide for themselves if they wish to disclose a disabling condition. Once an applicant requests that their disability status be considered, inquires can be made, bu t only to the extent necessary to \nverify eligibility. Project management should not attempt to make any determination concerning an applicant\u2019s disabling condition.  \n 11. May a guardian sign a rental agreement on behalf of a qualified person with a disability?  \n While there is no Federal law preventing a guardian from signing a rental agreement on behalf of a qualified person with disabilities, state law may vary. Each borrower should check with their legal counsel. To the extent individual state laws permit a guardian to sign a rental agreement, guardian signatures are to be accepted.  \n 12. What are the requirements for van accessible parking?  \n ",
  "page_634": "  HB-2-3560 \n  Appendix 5  \n  Page 15 \n \n__________________________________________________________________________________________  \n(07-19-24)  PN 619 The requirements vary based on when a project became ready for occupancy. . The parking lot of \nall projects with public areas such as an on -site office, ready for occupancy after January 26, \n1993, must be properly striped for van accessible parking and access aisles. All projects with public areas ready for occupancy before January 26, 1993, must be striped for van accessible parking and access aisles when ever the parking lot is re -striped.  \n 13. If accessible parking is located across the drive from the building it serves, must a \ncrosswalk be painted on the drive?  \n No, it\u2019s not required.  However, having a crosswalk is a good idea since it would indicate a crossing exists, and hopefully would signal a driver to slow down.  There is no requirement for a painted crosswalk in the accessibility standards.  Further, there is no requirement for the color of paint to be used.  White is most commonly used, and sometimes blue or yellow.  Curb ramps from the drive to the site are required.  \n 14. May a borrower allow a resident assistant to occupy a unit overnight to assist a tenant  \nwith a disability?  \n Yes. When a tenant with a disability provides a physician\u2019s statement requiring resident assistant care in excess of the established time periods for visitors, it would be a reasonable accommodation to the rules and policies to allow the resident assistant  to reside in the unit in \nexcess of established visitor\u2019s time. Further, if the need is for the resident assistant to live in the unit, it is a reasonable accommodation to rent a two- bedroom unit to a tenant at their request. \nThe income of a resident assis tant is not included in tenant household income.  \n \n15. Is the \u201cinterested person(s)\u201d who assists or is consulted during the borrower\u2019s preparation of their self -evaluation required to visit the project site?  \n No. While interested persons, including disabled persons or organizations representing disabled persons must be consulted they are not required to conduct a site visit.  \n 16. Is the self -evaluation required to be maintained at the project site?  \n Yes, if the project has an office. If there is no office, the borrower is still obligated to make the self-evaluation available to the public upon request. The public includes any applicant, tenant \nand the Agency. It is not reasonable for the borrower to expect the public to drive to a location other than the project to view the self -evaluation.  \n  17. What can be done with projects ready for occupancy after June 10, 1982 that were not built in accordance with UFAS standards, where it is either structurally impractical or financially infeasible to make the required changes?  \n \n \n ",
  "page_635": "HB-2-3560 \nAppendix 5  \nPage 16 \n \n Typically, the borrower should seek guidance from their project architect before making this \ndetermination. The Agency will need documentation that it is structurally impractical from a knowledgeable source. For example, in a project built using a split foyer design, it may be structurally impractical to make changes. The borrower might try to establish a referral agreement with another project in the local market area with a fully accessible unit. If no referral \nagreement is possible to make the program accessible, the Agency may administratively \nrecognize that the borrower is unable to address their outstanding non- compliance issues. In this \ncase, all avenues have been explored, and the Servicing Office will document the case file to fully explain the situation and the borrower\u2019s attempts to resolve the problem, remove the finding(s) from Multi- Family Housing Infor mation System (MFIS) and discontinue reporting the \nsituation through the post supervisory visit and compliance review reporting process.  In some instances, a borrower may claim that a project is not able to meet UFAS standards because the project\u2019s financ ial condition is such that the change would create an undue financial burden. For \nexample, the project is located in a poor rental market and rents are insufficient to address capital needs. While the Agency has no mechanism for waiving the requirements of  UFAS standards for \nfinancial reasons, the borrower may request a waiver from the Secretary of Agriculture. For such a waiver, the borrower must document the financial condition of the project as well as attempts to seek local, state, private and Federal f unding for grants or loans to correct the condition.  \n 18. Attachment C states that regardless of when a project was ready for occupancy, all  \nborrowers are required to have \"policies and practices\" that do not discriminate against persons with disabilities which are provided on Attachment C -1. Where do the  \nborrowers document these \"policies and practices\"?  \n Borrowers document these \u201cpolicies and practices\u201d in the management plan.  \n 19. If these policies and practices are not presently covered in the management plan should we ask everybody to provide written documentation of the \"policies\" now or, do we wait until the management plan is renewed, or the next supervisory visit/complianc e review \n(whichever comes first)?  \n We recommend that you be sure borrowers understand that these issues should be addressed in their management plans and that you will review these items in your supervisory visits, compliance reviews and management plan approvals. However, the Agency is not  required to \nconduct a full review of all existing management plans at this time.  \n 20. Attachment C also states that borrowers are supposed to maintain a record of the self -\nevaluation for at least three years. How are we going to document if they have one, if  \nthe three -year period is past? \n Part V of Form RD 400 -8, Compliance Review, should contain a record of self -evaluation status \nbased on Agency review. While the borrower is responsible to retain records for their own protection, we can retain any self -evaluation shared with us by the borrower in our files.  \n 21. Attachment C states that when structural changes are necessary, such changes shall be made within 3 years and as expeditiously as possible. What if major structural changes are needed and they can't be accomplished within a 3 -year period? \n \n  ",
  "page_636": "  HB-2-3560 \n  Appendix 5  \n  Page 17 \n \n__________________________________________________________________________________________  \n(07-19-24)  PN 619 Realistically, all structural changes should be accomplished within a three -year time frame \nunless funding is an issue. When changes are not made within the time frame of the transition \nplan, the borrower should prepare a new or revised 3- year transition p lan that documents what \nhas been done, what will be completed, and time frames for completion. Before we accept a plan, we need to be sure that the borrower is sincerely attempting to comply with the accessibility \nrequirements. We also need to assure that  rents and reserve account (RA) withdrawals are \napproved when necessary to make the changes.  \n \n22. Should transition plans exceed 3 years?  We have seen some that just say \u201cwhen funds are available.\u201d These plans are typically in projects where there is very little or no RA and rents must be kept low to keep tenants.  In these cases, there may never be funds available.  \n Transition plans may not exceed a 3 -year period and \u201cwhen funds are available\u201d is never a good \ntime-frame.   \u201cUpon rehabilitation\u201d is better language to use.  If a poor rental market is the real \nissue, the transition plan should be clear that the market is  the reason the borrower can not make \nneeded improvements.  If there is some way of addressing the cash flow problem (i.e., transfer RA, seek state or local grants, etc.), then the Agency should be ready to help the borrower move in that direction. This me ans that if a rent increase is needed, either to fund the improvement or \nbuild up the RA, the transition plan should document the amount that is needed and the Agency should be willing to approve higher rents. Also, the borrower should document their effor ts to \ncheck for funding elsewhere.  Some state and local governments have grant or loan funds that can  be used for providing accessibility.  Borrowers should be encouraged to seek out such funds if available.  Once the 3- year period is completed, if corre ctions have not been completed, a new \nor revised transition plan would be required listing those incomplete items, with a proposed timeframe.  \n 23. There are six additional items we are to review during the compliance review.  Where are these items to be documented?  \n You will notice that some of the answers are addressed by questions already on the physical inspection form or the compliance review. While, the Civil Rights Staff has not established a separate document for the purpose of documenting this review, your ass essment of the borrowers \nresponse to the six items should be documented in part V or VI of Form RD 400- 8. \n 24. If we should find a borrower out of compliance with accessibility requirements and the borrower comes back with a transition plan that says they will make accommodations as needed, will the Agency be able to accept that and say that the borrower is now  in \ncompliance for tracking purposes?  \n Yes, however the borrower is technically out of compliance until the problem is corrected. However, if the borrower has a self -evaluation and a transition plan that describes how that \nparticular finding will be resolved, we have established that the borrow er is taking the \nappropriate steps to resolve their problem by establishing a timetable for corrective action in the \n ",
  "page_637": "HB-2-3560 \nAppendix 5  \nPage 18 \n \n transition plan. A good analogy is how we use our workout plan. If a workout plan is in place \nand being followed, the Agency can recognize that the default finding is being resolved. Therefore, we treat the project differently in our classification system.  \n 25. Could you give us an example where time frames for compliance will be provided in \nAgency notices and will vary according to the nature of the non -compliance issue.  \n \nFor example, according to Civil Rights Staff policy, findings on the compliance review should be corrected in 30 days. This timeframe may be expanded if conditions warrant. According to MFH \nprogram direction, supervisory visit findings can be resolved using different timeframes, generally varying from 30 to 90 days . The Servicing Office has some flexibility in providing \ncorrective deadlines for findings found on the supervisory visit. Usually, these deadlines are \nestablished in relationship to the seriousness of the finding. Additionally, the letter to the borrower requesting corrective actions can combine findings and corrective time frames from both the compliance review and the supervisory visit.  \n 26. Do you see any problem with the Agency keeping a copy of the self -evaluation and \ntransition plan in the borrower's file? We initially told our field staff not to keep a copy because we didn't want the borrower to construe that as Agency approval of the documents; however, some of our field employees have asked for copies and are keeping them in the file.  \n It is a good idea to keep the self -evaluations and transition plans in the file because you should \nbe reviewing them with each management plan and budget approval. Routine budget approvals should now include reviewing the transition plan to make sure that identified capital improvements are in the budget.  \n 27. Are Agency field staff required to become \u201caccessibility\u201d police?  \n It is important to understand that since June 10, 1982, 7 CFR 15b requires the Agency to conduct compliance reviews regarding accessibility requirements. The bottom line is that the borrower is the party responsible for project compliance with accessibilit y laws. The Agency\u2019s role is to \nassure that the program, in general, is administered in accordance with accessibility laws. We identify non -compliance during limited reviews, make project resources available to help solve \nproblems, report problems through an internal reporting process, and respond to continued \nserious instances of non- compliance using established MFH program servicing tools.  \n 28. UFAS requires that wall cabinets in accessible units be mounted at 48\" above the floor.  \nIn rehabs, that has required relocating them. One owner requested mounting a separate shelf 48\" above the floor, between the base and wall cabinets.  Is this OK?  \n The Access Board has indicated that a shelf between base cabinets provides \u201cequivalent\u201d accessibility when it is not possible to lower wall cabinets. The shelf should not become the standard solution, but can be considered on a case -by-case basis.  For exa mple, if funds for \nrehabilitation are limited, the shelf may be a less expensive solution to removing and relocating wall cabinets.  If funds are available, the wall cabinets should be relocated.  Although deemed \n \n  ",

Is a 30\" x 34\" high workspace required in an accessible dwelling unit kitchen? While UFAS 4.34.6.4 requires this, it is not included in the list in Attachment B or added to the \nMFH Physical Inspection Form.  \n \nYes, it's required. The list in Attachment B was not intended to be all inclusive of UFAS standards, but to hit the big issues.  \n  30. UFAS 4.13.9 calls for lever handles on entrance doors to accessible units. An item on the MFH Physical Inspection form asks if lever handles were provided. Does this apply to all apartment doors?  UFAS requires lever handles on apartment unit entry doors only. The question on the MFH Physical Inspection form refers to apartment unit entry doors only. If a tenant needs lever handles throughout a unit, they may be requested as a \u201creasonable accommodat ion.\u201d  \n 31. Where are grab bars required?  \n Grab bars are required in the 5 percent of units that are \u201cfully accessible.\u201d UFAS 4.34.5 uses the language \u201cIf provided, grab bars will \u2026.\u201d Our Agency has taken the position that grab bars will be installed in order to make the \u201cfully accessible\u201d unit ready for a person with disabilities.  Grab bars are also provided in those units in which a tenant has requested them as a \u201creasonable \naccommodation.\u201d In those ground floor units constructed since 1991, FHA/AG required  blocking for \u201cadaptability.\u201d In those units, grab bars may be installed later as a form of \n\u201creasonable accommodation\u201d when requested.  \n 32. How do people writing Transition Plans know to require grab bars?  Since writers of Transition Plans base them on UFAS, the proposed plan may call for installing the blocking only, and not installing the grab bars. In requiring a Self Evaluation and possibly a Transition Plan from a borrower, field staff should make them aware that the Agency has taken the position that grab bars are required in 5 percent of the units that are \u201cfully accessible.\u201d  \n 33. An item on the MFH Physical Inspection form refers to a \u201cfunctional emergency call system.\u201d Are emergency call systems required in all fully accessible units?  \n If the fully accessible unit presently has an emergency call system, it must be functional. If no emergency call system is in place, the borrower does not have to provide one at this time. It may be necessary to add one as a \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d per tenant request. There has been \n ",
  "page_639": "HB-2-3560 \nAppendix 5  \nPage 20 \n \n considerable confusion on this issue, and we realize that this may be a different answer than you \nhave received in the past.  \n 34. Is additional maneuvering room in the bathroom required?  \n \nSome Transition Plans are indicating a need to enlarge the bathroom in an accessible unit to \nprovide a 5' turning circle, which UFAS requires in a common use bathroom. Writers of Transition Plans are incorrectly applying this requirement to a dwelling unit.  Agency staff should understand that an accessible dwelling unit bathroom must have clear floor space at the tub/shower and commode, but a 5\u2019 turning circle is not required within a dwelling unit bath.  Also, UFAS provides an exception in 4.22.3 for publ ic toilets with only one lavatory and \ncommode.  In those common use toilets, a 5\u2019 turning circle is not required.  \n   35. In addition to the requirement that 5 percent of a project\u2019s units must be fully accessible for persons with mobility impairments, is it true that MFH projects must also meet a requirement that an additional 2 percent of the units (over and above the 5  percent) \nmust be made fully accessible by individuals with hearing or visual impairments?  \n To implement Section 504, both HUD and USDA individually published regulations to apply to their respective programs.  While HUD\u2019s regulation does require that 2 percent of the units (over and above the 5 percent that are made fully accessible for persons with mobility impairments) be made accessible for individuals with hearing or visual impairments, USDA\u2019s regulation does not.  Consequently, MFH projects with project -based  HUD Section 8 that were built on or after July \n11, 1988, must meet this requirement , but MFH projects without project based HUD Section 8 \ndo not.  However, even when not required, borrowers are encouraged to make an additional 2 percent of the units accessible for persons with hearing or visual impairments.  \n  36.  We have an existing MFH property with multiple laundry rooms.  Must each laundry room be made accessible?  \n Not necessarily.  \n \u2022 For a property constructed for first occupancy after March 13, 1991, and subject to the \nFair Housing Amendments Act design requirements, laundries for the covered units must be on an accessible route, and the space must be accessible. This would apply to all ground floor laundries (or all laundries in a building with an el evator).  \n \u2022 In addition, for properties constructed, or with substantial alterations, after June 10, 1982, \nUFAS also applies. UFAS 4.1.3(3) states \u201cCommon Areas: At least one of each type of common area and amenity in each project shall be accessible and shall be loca ted on an accessible route to \nany accessible dwelling unit.\" This sets a minimum of one accessible laundry. If accessible units are located near one another, the nearest laundry must be made accessible.  If accessible units are located on opposite ends of the property, it may be necessary to make more than one laundry room accessible, depending on location and site topography. In such a situation, the nearest laundry room to each accessible unit must be made accessible.   \n \n ",

This does not, however, require borrower s to exceed the above \nstandards unless it is necessary to do so in response to a request for a reasonable accommodation from a person with disabilities.  \n In addition, UFAS 4.34.7.2 states that washing machines and clothes dryers in common use laundry rooms shall be front loading.\u201d RHS has taken the position that this requirement is met if  \nat least one washer and one dryer is front loading in every laundry room that is required to be accessible by UFAS.  This position is taken, in part, in recognition that there may be some increase in cost to provide front loading washers and dryers.  \n 37. If structural accessibility requirements of the Fair Housing Act were not met due to negligence of the borrower or their architect during construction, what can be done to get them corrected?  \n In cases where fault is established, it is a proper servicing action to seek corrections by borrowers at their own expense. To accomplish these corrections, some borrowers may in turn seek to enforce contractual agreements with project architects.  \n 38. What are the requirements for accessibility for a community room kitchen / kitchenette?  \n In many situations, the requirements for an accessible dwelling unit kitchen have been applied to a common use kitchen or kitchenette.  The Fair Housing Act Accessibility Guidelines and UFAS \nhave similar requirements.  \n \u2022 The community room must be accessible, including an accessible route, accessible doors, switches and outlets at proper height, etc.  \n \u2022 The kitchen area must have an accessible sink per UFAS 4.24. This includes a mounting height no higher than 34\u201d (or adjustable to 34\u201d), knee clearance underneath, clear floor space at the sink, insulated piping, and an accessible faucet.  \n \u2022 UFAS 4.25 and 4.1.2(11) further requires that a portion of the storage provided (shelves, drawers, and cabinets) have clear floor space and be within the reach range. This requirement is normally met with standard kitchen base cabinets.   \n \u2022 The kitchen must have a 60\u201d turning circle or \u201cT\u201d turn around for maneuverability. Space in the community room or a hallway immediately outside the kitchen may be used to meet this requirement.   \n ",

These requirements appear in UFAS 4.34, and only apply to an accessible dwelling unit.  \n \nThese requirements for a common use kitchen or kitchenette are minimums.

Can the street be utilized as part of the accessible route to an amenity?  Can the \ndisabled travel behind parked vehicles or with the traffic in the travel lane?  \n The accessible route may include travel behind a parked vehicle only if it is an accessible parking space. Crossing a traffic lane between curb cuts is acceptable. A striped crosswalk is not \nrequired. Otherwise, the street or traffic lane may not be part o f the accessible route for an \nindividual using a wheelchair.  \n \nIf the site amenity is located at a considerable distance from the accessible unit and its accessible parking space or if site terrain is such that an accessible route along sidewalks is not possible, a vehicle can be used.  This requires an accessible par king space at the site amenity, with an \naccessible route from that parking space to the site amenity.  In this situation, the disabled individual must travel from their unit to their accessible parking space, transfer to their vehicle, drive to the site amenity, transfer back to their wheelchair, and then go to the site amenity.  As you can see, this is not a convenient solution, and should be used only on existing properties in cases where no other solution is possible.    \n \n  "
