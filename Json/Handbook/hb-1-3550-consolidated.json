In providing this service, the Agency strives to meet several goals. \n \n• Customer service.  The Agency  is committed  to providing customer -friendly, \nstreamlined service.  \n \n• Partnerships. Working with partners, such as private lenders, nonprofit \norganizations, and State  and local  agencies,  can enhance the Agency’s  ability  to \nserve more borrowers.  \n \n• Effective  use of resources.  As a publicly- funded program, the direct  single  family \nhousing program must use tax dollars efficiently. The Agency aims to minimize \nadministrative costs, underwrite loans responsibly, and leverage funding with private sources of credit to the extent possible. \n \n1.4 SECTION  502 -- AN OVERVIEW  \n \nA. Program  Loans  \n \nThe Section 502 direct loan program is intended to provide very low - and low -income \npeople  with the opportunity to acquire,  build, rehabilitate,  improve  or relocate dwellings  in rural \nareas. The standard term for a Section 502 loan is 33 years. However, loans may be made for a shorter term, and in certain cases for 38 years. Each loan is made at a note rate established by the Agency under § 501 of the Housing Act of 1949, as amended, and outlined in RD Instruction  440.1.  Payment  subsidies  are available to some  borrowers  to reduce monthly loan \npayments. In summary, to be eligible for a Section 502 loan, applicants  must:  \n• Have an adjusted  income  that is at or below  the applicable low-income  limit \nat loan approval, (except  for assumed  loans  or loans  to purchase  Real Estate Owned \n(REO) property).  \n \n• Have  an adjusted  income  that is at or below  the applicable moderate- income  limit for \nassumed loans or loans to purchase an REO  property.  \n \n \n \n \n \n1-5 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL PN  \nRevised (11 -06-24) PN 628"

Nonprogram  Loans  \n \nThe Agency may provide credit on nonprogram terms to expedite the assumption of an \nexisting  program  loan or purchase  of an REO  property  by a borrower who is not eligible  for the \nSection  502 program. Nonprogram  loans  are originated  only when  it is in the best interest  of the \nGovernment. Nonprogram loans are discussed in detail in Chapter 11.  \n \nC. Demonstration  Programs  (7 CFR 3550.7)  \n \nThe Agency  may implement Demonstration  Programs  to meet  the overall  objectives  of \nthe Section 502 program which are outside the guidelines of this handbook or published \nregulations. Demonstration Programs may be initiated internally or may be required by legislation. The Rural Housing Demonstration Program is discussed in Appendix 5. \n \n1.5 SECTION  504 -- AN OVERVIEW  \n \nThe Section  504 direct  loan  and grant  program  is intended to  provide  funds  to homeowners \nwho cannot  obtain other  credit  to repair  and rehabilitate  their properties  or correct  health  and safety \nhazards. To be eligible, the applicant must have adjusted income that is at or below the applicable very low -income limit and meet other eligibility requirements similar to those for Section 502 \nloans. Detailed guidance on originating Section 504 loans and grants is provided in Chapter 12 of this Handbook."

Section  504 Grants  \n \nGrant funds may be used only to make repairs and improvements that will remove \nidentified  health  and safety  hazards  or to repair  or remodel  dwellings  to make  them  accessible \nand useable for household members with disabilities. Grants are available only to eligible \napplicants  who  are 62 years  of age or  older. Recipients  may receive multiple grants, up to a \nlifetime maximum of $10,000. \nB. Section  504 Loans  \n \nLoan  funds  may be used to make  general  repairs  and improvements  to properties,  and to \nremove health and safety hazards. Applicants may obtain multiple Section 504 loans, but the sum of the outstanding balance on all Section  504 loans  cannot  exceed  $40,000. The loans  have \na term of 20 years and an interest rate of 1 percent.  \n \n1.6 LOAN SERVICING  \n \nOnce loans are closed and the final disbursement has been made, they are serviced by \nServicing Office, located in St. Louis, Missouri. Servicing Office handles payments from the borrower, maintains escrow accounts for taxes and insurance, and provides counseling to past - \ndue borrowers.  When  necessary,  Servicing  Office initiates  action  to liquidate  borrower  accounts. \nBorrowers who are unable to repay their loans may be eligible for a variety of special servicing actions such as delinquency workout agreements, payment morat oriums, and refinance \nfollowing a moratorium.  Field  Offices  will be asked  to assist  with servicing  actions  when  a local \npresence is needed. Field Office servicing functions are described in Chapter 13  of this \nHandbook.  \n \n1.7 SECTION  306C  WATER  AND WASTE  DISPOSAL  (WWD)  GRANTS  TO \nINDIVIDUALS  \n \nApplicants  may also be eligible  to receive a Section  306C  WWD  grant  if the applicant  is \na resident of a colonia located in a rural area and meets the other program requirements. The objective of this program is to facilitate the use of community and/or waste disposal systems.  \nAppendix 6 provides  information  on the Section  306C  WWD  program."

Reasonable  Accommodations  for Persons  with  Disabilities  [7 CFR 15e.130]  \n \nNo individual with a disability shall, on the basis of  their disability, be excluded from \nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or otherwise be subjected to discrimination under any \nprogram or activity conducted by the agency.  The  Agency  must  make reasonable \naccommodations  to permit persons  with disabilities  equal access to apply for and benefit from \nAgency programs. Reasonable accommodations may include providing facilities that are \nphysically accessible so that all people can come to Agency offices, effective communication \nand outreach tools so that all applicants can ge t good program information (for example, a \nTelecommunications Device for the Deaf (TDD)) , or making a modification to an A gency \nprocess or procedure  to enable access . \n \nWhen a customer  with a disability cannot access a program or finds it difficult to meet a \nspecific requirement of a program, the Agency  must consider if the same result can be reached \nthrough different means.  The Agency  does not distinguish between reasonable accommodations \nand reasonable modifications.  Instead, both are captured by the term “reasonable accommodations.”  Under the regulations , the Agency  must follow the requirement to make \nreasonable accommodations through changes that may be necessary to  provide equal \nopportunity to participate in the federally conducted program or activity. \n Customers may request a reasonable accommodation in order to apply or participate in \nthe Single Family Housing (SFH) programs.  When a customer request s a reasonable \naccommodation , the Loan Originator and/or Loan Approval Official  should notify their \nimmediate supervisor  and coordinate with the Housing Program Director.   Through an \ninteractive engagement with the c ustomer, the Agency  must consider:  \n• The nature and/or cause of the disability, \n• How the disability is interfering with the customer’s ability to meet a requirement of \nthe program,  \n• What specific accommodations are being requested.  If known, identify the source \nand potential cost for providing the accommodation(s),  \n• If the customer is unsure of the needed accommodation, do they have any \nsuggestions about what options to consider, and  \n• If the accommodation would result in a fundamental alteration to the program purpose.  \n \nThe Housing Program Director may approve requests for reasonable accommodations \nwhen the above information has been fully considered and the outcome of providing the accommodation will result in successful customer access without making a fundamental alteration to the nature of the program.  Costs associated with providing a reasonable accommodation are the responsibility of the local office.  The Housing Program Director should consult the RD Civil Rights Office during the interactive engagement for any ne eded technical \nassistance.  Lastly, the Housing Program Director must coordinate with the RD Civil Rights Office before a request for a reasonable accommodation may be denied ."

The Agency’s  requirements \nfor handling assistance to employees, relatives and associates are described in RD Instruction 1900- D. State Office, Servicing Office, and National Office employee relationships are \nreviewed by the State Director who will obtain the Administrator’s written concurrence for application processing. To reduce the potential for conflicts of interest, all processing, approval, servicing, or review activity must be conducted by Agency employees who:  \n \n• Are not the recipient  (applicant  or borrower),  a recipient’s  family  member,  or a close \nknown relative and/or associates of the recipient;  \n \n• Do not have  an immediate  working relationship  with the recipient,  the Agency \nemployee related to the recipient, or the Agency employee who would normally conduct the activity; and \n \n• Do not have  a business  or close personal  association  with the recipient.  \nA.

    "content": "Paragraph  1.13 Conflict of Interest  [7 CFR 3550.9]  \nC. Disposition  of REO  Properties  \nAgency employees and members of their families are precluded from purchasing REO \nproperty, assumptions from Agency borrowers, or security property sold at a foreclosure sale. \nClosing agents  and members  of their families  are precluded  from  purchasing properties  in which \nthey have been professionally involved. \n1.14 OTHER  FEDERAL  REQUIREMENTS  \nA. Environmental  Requirements  [7 CFR 3550.5]  \n \nThe Agency considers environmental quality equally with economic, social and other \nfactors in its program development and decision- making processes. Both the Loan Originator \nand the Loan  Approval  Official  are responsible  for effectively  integrating  Agency  environmental \npolicies and procedures with loan and grant origination and servicing activities. Agency environmental policies and procedures and historic preservation requirements can be found in RD Instruction 1970 series “Environmental”. Agency- assisted properties also must meet the \nlead-based paint requirements contained in Exhibit H of RD Instruction 1924- A. Resolution of \nconflicts  or significant  differences  between  Agency  environmental  regulations  and State  or local \nenvironmental laws requires prior consultation with the appropriate State Environmental Coordinator and, if necessary, National Office environmental staff.  \nFor existing housing, a categorical exclusion may be completed if no resources are \nadversely  affected;  the property is not in a historic  district,  is not classified  as a historic  property, \nor is not considered culturally significant; and there is no flood disturbance. For new construction, the same level of review is required. In addition, any time ground is being broken, there is a potential to uncover historic resources, therefore additional consultation with the State Historic  Preservation  Officer  (SHPO)  and, as applicable,  the Tribal  Historic  Preservation  Officer \n(THPO) may be necessary. In states  where a programmatic agreement exists between  the SHPO \nand THPO, consultation may only be necessary with one part y. \nNew construction projects must also consider the effect of cumulative impact. This \noccurs when a project may develop over time and impact a larger number of prospective applicants  or acreage.  Many times,  Rural  Development  funds  are not used to purchase the land, \nbut the scope of the project includes Rural Development financing for the purchase of the \ndeveloped lots. In accordance with 7 CFR Part 1970, §1970.5(a)(4), “The Agency may act as either a lead Agency or a cooperating Agency in the preparation of an environmental review \ndocument. If the Agency  acts as a cooperating Agency, the Agency will fulfill the cooperating \nAgency responsibilities outlined in 40 CFR § 1501.6. \nAs an example, when funding is obtained for a multiple unit project, and the development \nwork is provided by another Agency (often HUD), that Agency will take the lead to prepare the environmental  review,  but Rural  Development  will be a cooperating Agency  so that the review  for \nboth programs’ requirements are satisfied in the initial environmental analysis.

Construction  Standards  \n \nSites and dwellings developed or rehabilitated with Section 502 funds must meet the \nconstruction standards  outlined  in RD Instructions  1924- A and 1924 -C. Existing  dwellings  must \nbe decent, safe, and sanitary and meet all applicable State and local codes.  \n \nC.

The types of loans available under Section 502 include:  \n• Initial loans;  \n• Assumed  loans;  \n• Subsequent loans; and  \n• Nonprogram  loans.  \nThis section describes the four types of loans and how they differ. The interest \nrate for SFH loans can be found in Exhibit B of RD Instruction 440.1. \n2.3 INITIAL LOANS  \nInitial loans are made when neither the applicant nor the seller has an existing Agen cy \nloan. Generally, they are made for the ma ximum loan term for which the applicant qualifies, and \nat the Rural Housing (RH) 502 very low or low interest rate.

    "content": "HB-1-3550    \n \n2.4 ASSUMED LOANS  \nSection 502 loans may be assumed. The terms and conditions of the assumption depend \nupon the eligibility of the new purchaser.  \nA. New Rates and Terms Assumption  \nWhen purchasing a property currently financed by a Section 502 loan, the new borrower \nwill typically receive new loan funds.  However, new rates and terms assumptions must be used \nwhen funding is limited (e.g. in September as a fiscal year is coming to a close and in October when a new fiscal year begins).  \nWith a new rates and terms assumption, the pur chaser assumes the outstanding debt  \n(including principal and recapture amounts) , which is reamortized at new rates and terms. If the \nnew purchaser and the property are eligible for the Section 502 program, the loan can be assumed on program terms. In addit ion, eligible new purchasers may receive subsequent loans \nto make up the difference between the amount of debt assumed and the purchase price, or may be able to obtain a leveraged loan. If the property does not meet Agency standards or will not be brought to Agency standards with the use of loan funds, or the new purchaser is not eligible, \nthe loan can be assumed on nonprogram terms.  Purchasers who assume the loan under nonprogram terms are not eligible for a loan to cover amounts above the amount assumed.  \nB. Same Rates and Terms Assumption  \nIn certain limited cases -- generally those involving transfers of title between family \nmembers --  a same rates and terms assumpti on, is permitted. Under this type of assumption, the \nexisting note terms, including the inter est rate and the remaining repayment period, do not \nchange.  \nThe new owner is not reviewed for income -eligibility, creditworthiness, or repayment \nability; and the property is not reviewed or appraised. The new owner may receive payment subsidy if eligible based on their household’s adjusted income. \nSame rates and terms assumptions are permitted for the following types of transfers:  \n• A transfer from the borrower to a s pouse or children not resulting from the death of \nthe borrower;  \n• A transfer to a relative, joint tenant, or tenant by the entirety resulting from the death \nof the borrower;  \n• A transfer to a spouse or ex -spouse resulting from a divorce decree, legal separatio n \nagreement, or property settlement agreement;  \n \n \n2-2"

Loan funds cannot be di sbursed until the three business days \nhave passed, unless a hardship exists and the applicant waives their right to cancel the loan in writing, as mentioned in Paragraph 8.6 F.2. Form RD 1940-43 is not used for subsequent loans made in \nconjunction with an assumption since the applicant does not have title to the  property."

The interest rate offered is somewhat \nhigher than for program -eligible borrowers, but is competitive in the marketplace. Borrowers \nwith nonprogram loans are not eligible for program benefits, such as payment subsidy, or for \nservicing actions, such as moratoriums.

The circumstances in which the Field Office can originate nonprogram loan s are \ndiscussed below.  \nA.

The potential applicant  may \nsubmit an application regardless of the outcome of the pre -qualification.  \n \nWhen an applicant submits a complete application, the application should be reviewed for \neligibility within 30 days , using guidance outlined in Chapter 4. The Loan Originator must \nselect applications for processing based on each applicant’s priority and the date the application \nwas determined complete.  If the applicant is not eligible, the Loan Approval Official will deny \nthe application. If the applicant is det ermined eligible, the Loan Originator will determine if \nfunding is available, using guidance outlined in Chapter 4, prior to issuing a Certificate of \nEligibility.   If funding is not available, eligible applicants will be placed on the waiting list. As \nfunds become available, applicants on the waiting list must be process ed in the appropriate \norder, based on priority status and application date.  \n \n2.11 BORROWER ELIGIBILITY ( Chapter  4) \n \nOnce the application has been selected for processing, the Loan Originator must  \ndetermine the applicant’s eligibility. This involves verifying the household’s income, checking the credit history of all parties to the note, and reviewing all other eligibility requirements. Once the applicant’s eligibility has been verified, the Loan O riginator uses verified income \ninformation to determine the amount of payment subsidy the household is entitled to, and the maximum loan amount the applicant will be  able to  receive.  \n \nBased on this information, the Loan Originator counsels the applicant ab out the level of \nmortgage debt the household can afford, and issues a Certificate of Eligibility, which is signed \nby the Loan Approval Official. The household then attempts to locate a home. In cases where \nthe applicant has already submitted a contract for  a property, no Certificate of Eligibility is \nneeded.  \n \n \n2-7 \n(01-23-03)  SPECIAL PN  \nRevised ( 03-09-22)  SPECIAL PN Processing Steps  \n \nThis section outlines the steps involved in processing a \nSection 502 loan.

This includes \nthe information needed to conduct an appraisal, to conduct an environmental review, and to \nverify  that the site and dwelling meet, or will be constructed to meet, all applicable requirements.  \n \n2.13 UNDERWRITING THE LOAN (Chapter  6) \n \nIf the ap plicant and the property meet the Agency’s standards, the Loan Originator must \ndetermine the loan amount needed and whether it can be supported by the household’s \nrepayment ability.  In order to determine repayment ability the Loan Originator must have a \ngood estimate of the impact that escrow payments for taxes, flood insurance, and hazard insurance will have on the household. Repayment ability also is affected by the payment subsidy the household is entitled to, which is based on the household’s adjusted income  \n \n2.14 TAXES, INSURANCE, AND ESCROW (Chapter  7) \n \nTo ensure that funds are available to pay for the cost of real est ate taxes, insurance \npremiums, and other assessments, the Loan Originator must have a good understanding of how to set up a good escrow account. Before closing the loan, the Loan Originator must work closely with the closing agent to get accurate figures to use in establishing escrow payments.  \n \n2.15 LOAN APPROVAL AND CLOSING (Chapter  8) \n \nThe Loan Approval Official reviews the case file and determines whether the loan can be \napproved. If the loan is approved, the Loan Originator notifies the applicant and obligat es the \nfunds.  \n \nThe applicant then selects a closing agent. The closing agent is responsible for \nconducting the preliminary title clearance and for ensuring that the property conforms to the \nAgency’s security requirements. The Loan Originator and closing agent work together to ensure that all required closing documents are prepared for signature at closing and that Agency funds arriv e before the date of closing. The Loan Originator activates the loan in LoanServ  after loan \nclosing and prepares a loan docket to send to the  Servicing Office  for servicing.  \nWhen a new home is to be built or rehabilitation on an existing dwelling is involv ed, the \nLoan Originator also oversees the progress of construction. This involves ensuring that inspections are performed at ap propriate points in the process, that mitigation measures \nestablished as part of any environmental review are properly implemente d, and that funds are \ndisbursed appropriately to pay for the work. \n \n2-8"

This includes pre -qualifications (largely \nthrough the Single Family Housing Direct Self -Assessment tool ), taking and reviewing \napplications, and selecting applications for processing. \n \nSECTION  1: PRE -QUALIFICATION  \n \n3.2 OVERVIEW  \n \nPre-qualification involves using unverified information to evaluate the likelihood that a \npotential applicant, someone who is interested in the program but has not yet applied, would be \nprogram eligible. The results of pre -qualification are not binding and will not hinder the \nsubmission of an application. A potential  applicant  with possible  obstacles  to program  eligibility \nmay apply and a potential applicant who appears program eligible is not guaranteed that a loan will be made.  \n \nThe standard  pre-qualification  method  is the potential  applicant’s  self-assessment \nusing the Single Family Housing Direct Self -Assessment tool . Agency staff should refer \npotential applicants to the tool in their marketing materials, while speaking to them, etc.  Pre- \nqualifications  completed  by the Agency  staff are limited.  To access  the Self-Assessment  tool, \nvisit: https://eligibility.sc.egov.usda.gov/eligibility/welcomeAction.do  and click on  the Single \nFamily Housing Direct tab.  \n \n3.3 PROCEDURES  FOR PRE -QUALIFICATION  \n \nOn those  limited  occasions  where the Agency  staff completes  a pre-qualification, \nthe Loan Originator should follow the procedures below. \n \n• Obtain  information  from  the potential  applicant  about  household members,  income, \ndeductions, debt, and the county where they want to purchase a home.  \n• Order  an in-file credit  report  if the potential  applicant  has signed  Form  RD 3550- 1, \nAuthorization to Release Information, and if it would aid in the review.  \n• Check the Department of the Treasury’s Do Not Pay (DNP) portal and check the \napplicant’s  social  security  number  against  Agency  records  by using LoanServ’s  “SSN \nCROSS REFERENCE” softlink key .  Staff must refer to the DNP SharePoint site  for \nthe most current guidance  about using the  DNP  portal, sources to be screened , \nrequired documentation, etc. If the “SSN CROSS REFERENCE” reveals a current \nloan or active application, follow the appropriate action below. \n \n3-1 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL  PN \nRevised  (11-06-24) PN  628\n \nCHAPTER  3: APPLICATION PROCESSING"

    "content": "HB-1-3550  \nParagraph  3.3 Procedures  for Pre-Qualification  \n \no If the pre-qualification  is for a subsequent  loan,  the Loan  Originator  should \ncontinue processing.  \no If the pre -qualification is for purchase, the Loan Originator should contact \nthe applicant  for additional  information  in order  to determine  the appropriate \naction.  For example, if the applicant is also a borrower on an existing \nAgency loan but is divorced, and the divorce decree did not make them \nresponsible for loan payments, the applicant should contact the Servicing Office to apply to be released from liability on the existing loan before \napplying for a new loan.  \no If the applicant has an active loan application in another Field Office, the applicant  must  decide to either  transfer the existing  application  to the new \nservicing area or continue processing with the existing servicing area, as \nthey may not have two applications in process at the same time.  \n• Enter  the information  in UniFi,  register  the pre-qualification  following the instructions  in \nthe DLOS Training Manual, and generate the Eligibility Summary using standard terms \n(unless the potential applicant appears to qualify for adjustments to the standard terms). If the potential applicant is working with a leveraged partner, consider the p ossible \nleveraging funds.  \n \n• Discuss the results with the potential applicant and emphasize that the results are informal  and unbinding. As applicable,  consider  the below  when  discussing  the results \nand refer to Attachment 3 -F for guidance on addressing negative results.  \n \no Moderate- Income  Applicant:  Discuss the possibility  of obtaining a nonprogram \nloan or obtaining a Guaranteed Rural Housing (GRH) loan. \n \no Insufficient  Repayment  Ability: Discuss the possibility  of obtaining subsidized \nfunds from other sources, reducing debt, and adding additional parties or a co-  \nsigner to the note. See  Chapter 4  Paragraph 4.24 of this Handbook for a \ndetailed discussion of other considerations related to maximum loan amounts. \n \no Potential Ability to Obtain Other Credit: If a potential applicant’s credit \nhistory, income (i.e., they appear to be above the very low -income limit), \nassets, and lack of apparent need for payment assistance indicate that they \nshould be able to qualify for a GRH loan or private financing, the potential \napplicant  should be informed  that they should attempt to obtain other  credit.  \n \n• If the pre -qualification was not conducted face- to-face or over the telephone, use \nHandbook Letter  19 (3550)  of Appendix 4 of this Handbook, Pre-qualification  \nReview,  to prompt  the opportunity to counsel the potential applicant. \n• Retain  all pre-qualification  records  in accordance with RD Instruction 2033- A and \nElectronic Customer File (ECF) guidance.  \n• As applicable, encourage the potential applicant to seek credit counseling or take a \nhomeownership education course.  NEVER discourage  the potential  applicant  from \napplying.  \n \n3-2"

If available  funding is not sufficient  for all eligible  applications  on the waiting \nlist, the priorities described in Paragraph 3.13 will be used to determine the selection of \napplications  for available  funds. This section  discusses the appropriate  actions  to take to notify \napplicants of their status and select applications for processing in the proper order.  \n \n3.11 DETERMINING  WHETHER  FUNDS  ARE  AVAILABLE  \n \nThe Loan Originator must determine whether funds are available before proceeding \nwith further processing. Loan Originators will review the number of applications on hand in UniFi  at least quarterly.  A sufficient  number  of applications  will be reviewed, and Certificates \nof Eligibility will be issued, as appropriate, based on expected state and national funding availability by income category over the next 90 days. The Loan Approval Official may use historical data, but generally the number of outstanding Certificates of Eligibility will not exceed 150 percent of the expected funding. State Directors will issue State Supplements to provide guidance about how many applications should be processed based on available funding levels. \n \nA. Regular  Funding  \n \nNationwide, at least 40 percent  of Section  502 loan funds  must  be allocated  to very low- \nincome households. Since each state meets this goal in different ways, Loan Originators also may have  to consider  the guidance  provided through State  Supplements  in determining  whether \nfunds are available for the applicant’s income category.  \n \nIn rare situations,  the funds  available may be less than the amount  for which  the applicant \nis eligible. If this occurs, it is important to follow consistent procedures. An example of a possible procedure is provided in Exhibit 3- 1. \n \n \n3-15 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL PN  \nRevised ( 11-06-24) PN 628"

Special  Funding  \nEach  year the National  Office  may designate  funds  to address  special  high- priority  needs \nidentified by the Agency. If an applicant falls into one of those high priority needs areas and \nfunds are available, the application can be processed immediately. For example, in a year in which funds have been set aside to target a particular geogra phic area, an application from a \nhousehold willing  to seek a property in that area could  be processed  ahead  of other  applications. \nInformation  about  funds  available for high- priority  needs  are distributed  to Field  Offices \nthrough State  Supplements, based  on guidance  from  the National  Office  through RD Instruction \n1940- L. \n3.12 IF FUNDING  IS NOT  AVAILABLE  \nIf funds  are insufficient  to proceed  processing an application  from  an applicant  who has \nbeen determined eligible, the applicant should be notified using Handbook Letter 2 (3550), \nFunds Not Available that they have been determined eligible, but funding is not currently \navailable.

    "content": "HB-1-3550  \n3.13 SELECTING  APPLICATIONS FOR  PROCESSING  \n \nApplications  will be selected  for processing  using the priorities  specified  in this \nparagraph.  \n \nA. Selection  Procedures  \n \nWithin  the respective priority  categories,  completed  applications  will be processed  in the \norder received. In the case of applications with  equivalent  priority  status  that are received  on the \nsame day, veterans’ preference will first be extended to those qualifying applicants. \n \nWhen funds are limited and eligible applicants will be placed on the waiting list, the \npriorities specified in this paragraph will be used to determine the selection of applications for \navailable funds. If a Field  Office  has a backlog of unprocessed  applications, a list of unprocessed \napplications should be generated from UniFi. The Loan Originator must select applications for processing based on each applicant’s priority and the date the application was determined complete as outlined in Paragraph 3.7. The number of applications selected will be determined based on guidanc e from the State Director.  \n \nWhenever applicants are selected for processing, a copy of the waiting list should be \nmaintained  and placed  in an operational  file to document  that the applications  were processed  in \nthe correct order. This is important because the electronic files will be overwritten, leaving no documentation to verify that proper procedures were followed.  \n \nB. Processing  Priorities  \n \nA priority  system  is used to ensure  that applicants  who meet  the priorities  established  for \nthe program are selected for processing first. The priority system is used only to determine the order in which applications will be processed. A priority will be established once an application has been determined complete; the priority should be marked  on Attachment 3 -G and \ncompleted i n the Registration Screen in UniFi . Once applicants are selected for processing, the \norder in which they actually receive funding will depend on how long it takes to conduct all required  verifications  and how  long it  takes the household to  locate a  property. Attachment  3-C \nprovides a case study that illustrates the use of priorities in selecting applicants for processing. \n \nThe Agency  gives  processing  priority  to applicants  who have  an especially  serious  need \nfor immediate assistance  and for loans that  are to  the Agency’s benefit. Applicants with higher \npriorities must be processed before those with lower priorities. Applicants who do not qualify for any priority should be processed only when no applications with a priority remain unprocessed. Within each prior ity category, applications should be processed in the order they \nare considered complete.  The types of priorities are described below.  \n \n \n \n \n \n3-17 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL PN  \nRevised ( 11-06-24) PN 628"

First  Priority:  Subsequent  Loans  to Correct  Health  and Safety  Hazards  \n \nCurrent  Agency  borrowers  who request  subsequent  loans  to correct  health  and safety \nhazards will be selected for processing first.  \n \n2. Second  Priority:  REO  Property  or Transfer/Purchase of Agency -Financed  Property  \nApplicants  interested  in obtaining loans  for purposes  that are in the Agency’s  interest, \nbut that do not directly involve removing hazards in a security property, will receive \nsecond priority for processing. These are loans related to the sale of Real Estate Owned (REO) property and loans related to the transfer and assumption (or purchase with new loan proceeds) of property owned by a program bor rower.  \n3. Third  Priority:  Hardships  \nApplicants  facing  housing- related  hardships  will receive third  priority  for processing.  \nHardship circumstances include living in deficient housing for more than 6 months. Deficient housing is defined as a dwelling that lacks complete plumbing, lacks adequate \nheating, is dilapidated  or structurally  unsound, has an overcrowding situation  that will be \ncorrected with loan funds, or is otherwise  uninhabitable, unsafe,  or poses  a health  or \nenvironmental  threat  to the occupant  or others. To  retain  the hardship designation, the \nresulting  loan must  eliminate  the deficient  housing issue which existed at the time of the \napplication. Other hardship circumstances include current homeowners in danger of losing a property through foreclosure due to circumstances beyond their control, and other circumstances determined appropriate by the State Director on a case- by-case \nbasis.  \n \n \n \n3-18 \n  Example  - Deficient  Housing  Scenario  \n \nThe Smiths  are an 8-person household currently  living  in a 2-bedroom  apartment.  They \nqualify for hardship processing because they are overcrowded  with more  than 2 people \nper bedroom. In order to retain the hardship priority, they would need to purchase a property (4 or more bedrooms) which corrects the overcrowding condition. \n \nIf the Smiths selected a 3 -bedroom property, they would no longer qualify for the \nhardship processing/funding priority. However, assuming the dwelling meets the property requirements, a loan could be made on the dwelling when funds become available under  the fifth/general  priority,  as the Agency  has no minimum number  of \nbedroom requirement based on household size."

The packager will gather and submit the information needed for the Agency to determine if \nthe applicant  is eligible  along with a fully  completed  and signed uniform  residential  loan application. \nFor the Section 502 loan program, this review will be completed using the borrower eligibility requirements found in Chapter 4 of this Handbook and the Worksheet for Computing Income and Maximum Loan Amount Calculator available on the SFH Direct Loan Application Packagers resource page ( https://www.rd.usda.gov/programs -services/services/direct -loan-application -\npackagers ). For the Section 504 program, this review will be completed using the borrower \neligibility requirements in Chapter 12 and the 504  Automated  Worksheet available on the SFH  \nRepair Loan  & Grants webpage (https://www.rd.usda.gov/programs -services/single -family -housing-\nrepair -loans -grants ). \nIf the potential applicant  appears to be ineligible for the program (at any time in the packaging \nprocess), the packager should counsel them on ways to improve their situation. Packagers should not submit loan application packages to the Agency (or to an intermediary if present) that are unlikely to be determined  eligible  by the Agency  staff.  If the program  does not appear \nto be a good fit for the potential applicant, the packager should advise the potential applicant that the program does not appear to be a good fit, notify them that they will not continue packaging the application as a result but that the potential applicant is welcome to apply \ndirectly to the Agency. Potential applicants who were considering building via the self -help \nprogram  but who do not appear  to qualify  for a loan should be counseled  that applying directly \nto the Agency would exclude participation in the self -help program.  \n \nIf the potential  applicant  appears  to be eligible  for the program, the packager  will: \n \n• Provide  the potential  applicant  with the required  disclosure  letter.  The letter  must  follow \nthe format provided in this attachment and must be signed by the potential  applicant.  \n• For applicants who are not participating in the self -help program, strongly discourage \nthe potential Section 502 direct program applicant from locating a property until the Agency  receives  their application  package and issues Form  RD 1944-  59, Certificate  of \nEligibility (COE).  \n• Applicants  for the self-help program  may be advised  of potential  property locations  and \nhouse plan options in order to package  an application with an appropriate loan amount \nfor the project. \n• Collect all the items that the Agency will need to consider the package complete. The \nApplication  Submittal Cover  Letter  (as provided in this attachment)  must  be completed \nand included in the submitted loan application package.  \n  \n \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL  PN \nRevised  (11-06-24) PN 628"

Once the package is \naccepted  by the intermediary,  the package will be sent to the Agency  via eForms.  \n• For Section 523 TA grantees submitting applications for a self -help build or \nrehabilitation  project,  the grantee  packager  will submit the application  directly  to \nthe Agency via eForms.  \n• The packager  will need  to obtain the potential  applicant’s  credit  report  to conduct \na preliminary credit analysis. Any cost for the credit report is considered part of the packaging fee and should not be charged to the applicant. The Agency will not furnish a credit report for packaging purposes.  \n• When gathering verifications, the packager should use the preferred sources \noutlined in Chapter 4. Preferred sources generally do not involve asking third-  \nparties  to complete  an Agency  form  and can be obtained  with  information  readily \navailable to the applicant (such as pay stubs, award letters, etc.). If a third -party \nverification must be obtained because the preferred source involves a fee, the packager may request and receive the form directly.  Packagers typically should \nnot obtain Form RD 1910- 5, Verification of Employment (VOE), nor should \nAgency  staff request  VOEs  for all applications. VOEs  should only be obtained if \nthe applicant does not have access to pay stubs or the information can only be obtained through a source which charges a fee.  \n• Packagers  should only gather  documents  needed  for the specific application.  For \nexample, do not obtain a Landlord’s Verification (Form RD 1944- 60) when the \napplicant(s) seemingly qualify for a streamlined credit history analysis. Only \ncollect and remit items needed for the Agency’s decision.  \n• The Agency will accept appraisals ordered by self -help grantees, certified packagers, \nand Agency -approved intermediaries  (‘authorized third -party’) provided that : \n• Rural Development (RD) is notified of the  intent to order the appraisal  and \nthe cost of the appraisal prior to any contractual commitment.  Once \nnotified, Rural Development will:  \n• Within three business days of receiving this notification, issue the applicant a third -party appraisal Loan Estimate (LE) and \naccompanying tailored Appendix 4, Handbook Letter 5 of this Handbook.  \n• List the cost of the appraisal  as provided by the authorized third \nparty , which may exceed the Agency’s prevailing appraisal fee in  \nChapter 5, Paragraph 5.20 of this handbook."

You may work with multiple intermediaries \ndepending on the service area you wish to cover.  \n4. Once you have identified with an intermediary as being part of the certified packaging process, you have 6 months to take the loan application packaging course  and pass the corresponding test. It is your responsibility  to provide  evidence \nto the intermediary  that you have  completed  this requirement. During the 6-month \nperiod, you may package loans and funnel them via the intermediary who will conduct the quality assurance review and provide technical  assistance.  \n \nLoan  Application  Packaging Course:  \n \nUnder  the certified  packaging process,  the course  requirements  outlined in 7 CFR \n3550.75(b)  (1)(iii),(b)(3)(vii) and (c) can be fulfilled  by the Agency  approved packaging course \noffered  by NeighborWorks, the Housing Assistance  Council, and  Rural  Community  Assistance \nCorporation.

Parties will have one year from the date of being added to the certified packaging process to complete the course  requirements  and provide  evidence  to the appropriate  party  (intermediary  or \nAgency depending on the situation) that the requirements have been fulfilled. Failure to provide the necessary evidence within the allotted time will result in immediate removal from the certified packaging process. For certified packagers funneling thr ough an intermediary, the intermediary is responsible for monitoring \ncompliance with th e course requirements and notifying the certified packager of \ntheir removal  from  the process  if not met. For certified  packagers  with an approved \nopt-out, the State Office is responsible.

A packager  can help determine  if the Section 502 \nDirect Loan Program is a good fit and, if so, help to assemble a complete loan application package. Loan application packaging fees can generally be included in the Rural Development loan or can be paid by the seller, builder, or third party. P ackagers do not work for or represent Rural Development. \nEligible loan applic ation packagers can either work with or without an approved intermediary. An \nintermediary is an affordable housing nonprofit, public agency, or State Housing Finance Agency approved by Rural Development to perform quality assurance reviews on loan application packages. Loan application packages funneled through an approved inter mediary receive priority processing.  \n Priority status may also include applications for:  \n• Agency  borrowers  requesting subsequent  loans  to correct  health  and safety  hazards  \n• Applicants  interested  in obtaining loans  for Real Estate  Owned  property  or related  to the \ntransfer and assumption of property owned by a program borrower  \n• Applicants  facing  housing- related  hardships  (please identify any housing -related hardships you may be \nexperiencing on the Attachment 3 -J of this Chapter , which is completed as part of the standardized \napplication package ). \nLoan  applications  which  do not qualify for priority  consideration will be selected  for processing after \nall applications with priority status have been processed.  \nPlease contact a loan application packager or the above Rural Development office if you have questions  regarding what  needs  to be in your application  package or if would like assistance in \ncompleting a form.

    "content": "“DOES  IT MATTER  HOW  MANY OTHER  BILLS  I HAVE  TO PAY?”  \n \nRHS will look at your monthly obligations and how much you currently owe to others. We’ll want  to \nknow  if paying back  the proposed loan on top of your other  payments  will be difficult for you.  \n \n“WHAT  IF I THINK MY  INCOME  IS TOO LOW?” \n \nHaving enough income to repay your loan is an important part of getting a loan; however, the RHS  \nloan may be subsidized. A subsidized loan is based  on the applicant  repaying a percentage of their \nincome toward the housing payment, taxes, and insurance. The percentage is generally 24 percent of \nthe applicant’s household income.  “WHAT  CAN I DO IF MY INCOME  IS TOO LOW?” \n \nConsider  applying with a co-applicant  if there  is another  member  of your household willing  and able \nto be a note signer. RHS will then look at your combined income and credit when determining repayment ability. You may also consider a co- signer. A co -signer is an individual who will not \nreside in the dwelling, but who is willing to be responsible for the debt. You may also consider applying for down payment assistance programs in your area which provide affordable  housing \nproducts. Many  areas  have Housing Finance Agencies,  Housing Authorities, or Nonprofit Agencies \nwhich administer these programs. Funding from these sources can be combined with Rural Development loan funds.  \n \n“HOW  CAN I DETERMINE  IF MY INCOME  IS ADEQUATE  TO REPAY A LOAN?”  \n \nThe amount of your proposed monthly house payment, real estate taxes, insurance, and other credit debts cannot exceed 41 percent of your gross monthly income. If you have questions regarding  how \nthis determination  is made,  you may contact  the local  Rural  Development  Office shown on the front \ncover.  \n“CAN I GET  A LOAN IF I’M UNEMPLOYED?”  \n \nA steady  source  of income  is very important  to getting a loan. An applicant  must  show  sufficient \nresources to repay the housing loan. Not having a job or a stable source of income may have an impact on the Agency’s decision. Experience has shown that applicants with stable jobs and income sources are more likely to repay the loan.  \n “WILL  YOU FIND OUT  ABOUT  OTHER  CREDIT  I’VE  HAD?”  \n \nYes. Your credit report provides information on your payment history including any difficulty you have had repaying other loans or credit cards. That information will be used to determine if you can \nrepay  the loan.  If you are unsure  what  your credit  history  contains, you can obtain  a free credit  report  \nby calling  1-877-322-8228 or logging into \nhttps://www.annualcreditreport.com. By law,  individuals  \nare entitled  to receive one  free credit  file disclosure  every  12 months  from  each of the nationwide \nconsumer credit reporting companies – Equifax, Experian and TransUnion.  Furthermore, the three \nnationwide credit reporting agencies have permanently extended a program  which provides free \nweekly online credit reports . \n \nThis free report  cannot  replace the credit  report  that the Agency  will obtain to determine eligibility.  \n \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL  PN \nRevised  (11-06-24) PN 628HB-1-3550  \nAttachment 3 -D \nPage 3 of 5"

    "content": "“HOW  LONG  WILL  IT BE BEFORE I CAN MOVE  INTO  MY  NEW  HOME?”  \n \nTypically, applicant eligibility, loan approval, and loan closing may be accomplished within \napproximately 120 days of filing  a complete  application. However,  depending on the availability \nof Government funding, this timeframe  may be extended. The applicant is periodically advised \nregarding the status of their application when there is lack of funding.  \n \nApplications will be processed based on the following priorities: 1) subsequent loans to correct \nhealth and safety hazards, 2) loans to purchase homes owned by RHS and loans to transfer and assume  (or purchase  with new loan funds)  properties  owned by RHS  borrowers,  3) hardships  as \ndefined by RHS, 4) loans that bring in additional resources as defined by RHS, including loan application packages funneled through an approved intermediary, and 5) applications that do \nnot qualify for priorities  1 - 4. Within  each priority  category,  veterans’  preference will be given \nto applicants who were discharged or released (except for a dishonorable discharge) from the  \nU.S. active forces  (regardless  of the position held – administrative  support, combat,  mechanics, \nmedical, transportation, etc.) and who actively served during eligible periods.  \n \n“HOW  MUCH  MONEY  WILL  I NEED  FOR  A DOWN PAYMENT?”  \n \nA down payment is generally not required. Loans may be made for up to 100 percent of the \nmarket  (appraised)  value.  Simply  put, this means  if the sales  price of the property  is equal  to or \nless than the appraised value, no down payment is  typically  needed  unless you exceed applicable \nasset thresholds for elderly and non- elderly households . \n \n“DOES  THIS  MEAN  I WON’T  NEED  ANY CASH  TO GET  A LOAN?”  \n \nGenerally, the applicant will need some cash available. There are costs associated with the credit \nreport, appraisal report, escrow, and other related closing costs. The credit report fee is always paid by the applicant upfront. The first year’s hazard ins urance premium and whole house \ninspection report  fee are paid prior  to closing unless  included in the loan amount. Costs  pertaining \nto the appraisal, escrow, and loan closing may be included in the loan amount. You may also negotiate  with  the seller  to contribute  a percentage  toward  closing costs.  Any agreement  with  the \nseller should be entered into prior to signing and documented in the purchase agreement or sales contract . \n “DOES  THE  APPLICANT  HAVE  OTHER  RESPONSIBILITIES?”  \n \nYes. Rural  Development  staff are available to assist  the applicant  from  the application  to loan \nclosing. The applicant is responsible for providing requested information timely. The information  may be requested  by Rural  Development  staff,  a loan application  packager,  a real \nestate agent, or a closing agent. Failure to provide information timely results in delayed decisions and other actions. \n \n HB-1-3550  \nAttachment 3 -D \nPage 4 of 5"

Be a U.S. citizen,  a U.S. noncitizen  national,  or a qualified  alien  and provide \nacceptable evidence of qualified alien status.  \n“WHAT  ARE  THE  TERMS  OF THE  LOAN?”  \nThe maximum repayment  period is 33 years  and, under  certain  conditions, 38 years  if the \napplicant is income eligible and the longer term is necessary to show repayment ability . Rural \nDevelopment staff can work with you if you are determined eligible, to determine whether a \n38-year term is appropriate . The maximum repayment period for manufactured homes is 30 \nyears.  \n“WHERE  MAY  HOUSES  BE LOCATED?”  \nHouses must be located in a rural area, on desirable sites with an adequate supply of safe \ndrinking water  and suitable  arrangements  for sewage disposal. Streets  must  have  an all-weather \nsurface and be maintained by a public body or a homeowner’s association.  \n \n“WHAT  ABOUT  THE  FEATURES  OF THE  HOME  AND SITE?”  \nWhile cost and features vary in different areas of the country, the home and site must be \nmodest. A modest site generally cannot be subdivided under local zoning laws, does not \ninclude land or structures that will be used principally for income -producing purposes, and \ncomplies with local zoning requirements. An existing home with an in- ground swimming \npool may be considered modest; however, in- ground swimming pools with new construction \nor with properties that are purchased new are prohibited. Under certain conditions, an exception  to these standards  may  be granted  on a case- by-case basis.  The value  of a dwelling \nmay not exceed  the area loan limit  for the  area in which  the applicant  is requesting financing.  \n \nWHO  IS RESPONSIBLE  FOR  INSPECTING  THE  HOME?  \nThe applicant/borrower is responsible for hiring a qualified inspector to conduct a whole house inspection on an existing  property and for making inspections  necessary  to protect  their interests. \nWhile a Rural Development staff member or designee may inspect a property during and/or following construction or repair,  these inspections  do not create or imply  a warranty  or guarantee \non the condition of the property. \n \n“WHERE  MAY  I APPLY?”  \nApplications  are made at the local  Rural  Development  office  or through an application  packager \nserving the area where the house will be located.

Your credit scores are found on  your tri -merge credit report, a copy of which  will be \nprovided to you upon request. The range of possible scores is from 300 to 850.

Please keep  in mind  that the factors  are only \nindicators of why you received less than the maximum score possible.

A \nborrower must be income -eligible, demonstrate a credit history that indicates ability and \nwillingness to repay a loan, and meet a variety of other program requirements. This chapter \nprovides guidance for each of these areas.  \n \n• Section  1: Evaluating Borrower Income provides  instructions  for calculating  and \nverifying annual, adjusted, and repayment income. \n• Section  2: Evaluating Borrower Assets  discusses Agency  requirements  for cash \ncontributions to the purchase and methods for computing income from assets. \n• Section  3: Credit  History  identifies  indicators  of acceptable and unacceptable  credit \nand provides instructions for reviewing an applicant’s credit  history. \n• Section  4: Other Eligibility  Requirements  addresses  a variety  of other \nrequirements applicants must meet to be eligible for the program.  \n• Section  5: Processing  the Certificate  of Eligibility  provides  policies  and \nprocedures for processing Form R D 1944- 59, Certificate of Eligibility.  \n \nSECTION  1: EVALUATING  BORROWER  INCOME  \n4.2 OVERVIEW   \n \nLoan Originators use income information to: (1)  help determine whether an applicant is \neligible for a loan; (2) calculate the applicant’s ability to repay a loan; and (3) determine the amount of the loan and the amount of payment subsidy the household can obtain. When reviewing an applicant’s repayment income, the Loan Originator must determine whether the \nincome  is stable  and dependable. This will typically  be accomplished  by reviewing  information \nprovided in the application, paystubs, and tax returns. The  Loan Originator will generally need \nto look at two years of history to determine the dependability of the  income.

    "content": "4-2 \n HB-1-3550  \nParagraph  4.2 Overview  \n \nA. Key Concepts  for Income Determinations  \n \n1. Income Definitions  \n \nThree income definitions are used. Whenever income determinations are made, it is \nessential that the Loan Originator use the correct income definition and consider income \nfrom the appropriate household members. To determine whether the applicant will be \nable to repay a loan, the Loan Originator must use repayment income. To determine whether an applicant is income -eligible to receive a program loan or payment subsidies, \nthe Loan  Originator  must  use adjusted  income. Adjusted income  is calculated  in 2 steps. \nFirst, the annual income of all household members is calculated. Then, certain \nhousehold deductions for which the family may qualify are subtracted from annual income to compute adjusted income.  \n \n• Annual Income is the amount of income that is used to determine an applicant’s eligibility for assistance.  Annual income is defined as all amounts, \nmonetary  or not that are not specifically  excluded  by regulations, that go to, or \nare received on behalf of, the applicant/borrower, co- applicant/co -borrower,  \nor any other  household member (even if  the household member is  temporarily \nabsent).  \n \n• Adjusted  Income is used to determine  whether  a household is income  eligible \nfor payment assistance. It is based on annual income and provides for deductions to account for varying household circumstances and expenses.  \n \n• Repayment Income is used to determine whether an applicant has the ability to make monthly loan payments. It is based only on the income attributable to parties  to the note and includes  some  income  sources  excluded  for the purpose \nof adjusted income. Repayment i ncome is used during servicing only to \ndetermine if a borrower is eligible for a Moratorium or Reamortization as described in Chapter 5, Paragraph 5.5 of HB -2-3550. \n \n2. Whose  Income To  Count  \n \nFor repayment income, the Loan Originator must consider only the income of \nhousehold members  who will be parties  to the note. For adjusted  income,  the income  of \nall household members must be considered. For both types, live -in aides, foster \nchildren, and foster adults living in the household are not considered household members."

Three different\nincome limits are used for the Section 502 and 504 programs. The National Office \nprovides the income limits  and updates the limits  whenever they are revised. The income \nlimits can be found online at: https://www.rd.usda .gov/files/RD- DirectLimitMap.pdf . \nAdjusted  income should be compared  to the income  limit to determine  the category \nin which each household falls. Income limits are as follows: \n•The very low-income limit is an adjusted  income limit developed in\nconsultation with HUD;\n•The low-income limit is an adjusted  income  limit developed in consultation\nwith HUD; and\n•The moderate-income limit is an adjusted income that does not exceed the\nmoderate- income  limit for the guaranteed  single family  housing loan program.\n4.Applicant  Certification  and Verification  Requirements\nEach  applicant  must provide the income,  expense,  and household information  needed\nto enable the Agency to make income determinations. Most of this information is provided on the application, but some additional follow-up with the applicant may be required, as described in Chapter 3, Paragraph 3.8 of this Handbook. The applicant should be requested to provide two years of history (as applicable)  for a reasonable \ndetermination of income. The documentation required will vary with the source of income. In most cases, the Loan Originator will compare information provided on the application with the tax returns, W-2s, and other preferred verification sources to evaluate the two -year history of income and make the determination if income is stable \nand dependable.  \nThe\n need to use Form RD 1910-5, Request for Verification of Employment (VOE) , \nto document previous employment (Part III of the form) should be rare and limited to cases where the preferred verification sources are insufficient to document the applicant’s employment history. The Loan Originator and Loan Approval Official will not routinely require a VOE or contact the employer. In some instances, less than  two \nyears of history may  be acceptable when  the applicant  provides, and  the Loan  Originator \ndocuments sound justification.  For example, an applicant whose compensation changed \nfrom hourly to salary income with the same employer in a similar job/position may be considered to have dependable and stable income. While not typical, more than two years of history ( i.e., obtaining an additional year’s tax return) may be needed."

    "content": "4-5  \n HB-1-3550  \nParagraph 4.2 Overview  \n \nFor example, when an applicant’s income varies significantly from year to year, the \nLoan Originator may need to review a longer work/self -employment history to establish \nan average income. This can typically be accomplished by obtaining an additional year’ s \ntax return with accompanying attachments.  In no case will more than 3 years of history be \nobtained.  \n \nExample – Comparing income  \n \nWhen calculating Jorge’s income based on the paystub’s year to date income, the Loan \nOriginator notices that the historical income from last year’s tax return reflects $10,000 more in \nincome.   \n Inappropriate response:   Automatically r equire a VOE . \n \nAppropriate response:   Contact the applicant and ask what has changed with their income as \ncompared to last year (such as: change in hours, pay rate, or overtime).  Document the applicant’s response and determine  which income source will be used as a result.   \n For instance, the paystub information is through May, but the applicant reports  that the bulk of \ntheir overtime is received in November and December each year. In this case, using historical \ndata is more appropriate than year to date.  \n \nIn the limited  situations  when  verification  from  a third  party  is requested,  a copy of \nForm RD  3550- 1, Authorization to Release Information, must accompany the request. \nAuthorization from each adult household member on the Form RD 3550- 1 permits the \nLoan Originator  to ask for, and verification sources to release, the needed information. \nApplication processing should not be delayed if a third party does not respond to a \nrequest  for information. In these instances,  the Loan  Originator  must  seek to obtain the \nmost relevant information which can be obtained from the applicant to verify the information. This may  include, but is not limited to, evidence of deposits/withdrawals, \ncopies of cancelled checks, etc.  \n \nThe verification and certification formats that are provided in Appendix 2 of this \nHandbook are not official Agency forms.  They are samples  that may be adapted as \nneeded for particular circumstances.  In some  instances,  the same format  can be used \nwhether  a third  party  is providing the verification,  or the applicant is making a \ncertification.  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL PN  \nRevised  (11-06-24) PN 628"

The key concept is whether the applicant has a history of receiving stable \nincome and a reasonable expectation that the income will continue. Instead, t he Loan \nOriginator must carefully assess the applicant’s income to establish whether it can reasonably be expected to continue for the next two years  (e.g., child support and \ncontract ual income) . Nonetheless , most income cannot be guaranteed, nor will employers \ncertify tha t income will continue for the next two years.  A VOE should not be requested \nto obtain ‘ probability of continued employment’ in order to make this determination.  \nInstead, the Loan Originator and Loan Approval Official will compare projected income with the last two years of income (if applicable) to determine if the applicant has demonstrate d an income level which is likely to continue.  \n The applicant must provide an explanation letter for employment gaps in excess of \n30 days unless their income history is clearly seasonal in nature  (e.g., construction, farm \nlabor, recreational) . The Loan Originator must review the employment gap explanation, \nas well as the historical/projected income  to determine the applicant’s ability to receive \nstable and dependable income.  If the Loan Originator determines that an  applicant’s  \nincome  source  is unstable  and undependable, the income  must  be excluded from \nrepayment but included in annual income.  \n \n• Wage and Salary Income. Income from employment may include a base hourly wage or salary, overtime pay, commissions, fees, tips, bonuses, housing allowances,  and other  compensation for personal  services  of all adult \nmembers of the household. When the applicant demonstrates a two- year \nhistory of stable or rising income, current income from each of these sources may be used unless there is evidence to the contrary. Wage and salary \nincome may be determined from paystubs and historical data. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________________________________________________________________________  \n4-6"

She applied for the loan in May just at the start of cherry season and provided a paystub for her \ncurrent employer.  However, since she has multiple employers, the historical income should be used.

Income based on a two -year history of self - \nemployment, in the same line of work, is an acceptable indicator  of stable  and \ndependable income.

The Loan \nOriginator  may concur with the calculations  and continue processing.  \n \nExample 2 \nOrcas County Community Action (OCCA) submitted an income calculator based on paystubs and tax \nreturns.  The year -to-date income based on the paystub is $5,839 but the year -to-date entered on the \ncalculator is $8,539 due to a typographical error. As a result, the income projections for the family of eight  are considerably more than they should be.  The L oan O riginator  will need to prepare a corrected \nversion and send it to OCCA to document the corrections to the income calculations , which result ed in a \nlower  loan amount . \n \n4.3 SOURCES  OF INCOME  \n \nLoan  Originators  will consider  sources  of income  to determine  annual  and repayment \nincome.  This section provides guidance on income that will and/or will not be counted.  \n \nA. Income Considered  for Annual  and Repayment  Income \n \nFor annual  income , consider  income  from  the following sources  that are attributable  to \nany household member. For repayment income , consider income from the following sources \nthat are: attributable to parties to the note and represent a source of dependable income.  \n \n1. The gross amount, before any payroll deductions, of base wages and salaries, \novertime pay, commissions, fees, tips, bonuses, housing allowances, and other compensation for personal  services  of all adult  members  of the household. If a cost \nof living allowance or a proposed increase in income has been estimated to take place on or before loan approval, loan closing, or the effective date of the payment assistance agreement,  it will be included as income.  For annual  income , count  only \nthe first $480 of earned income from adult full -time students who are not the \nborrower, co- borrower, or spouse . \n      \n____________________________________________________________________________________________  \n4-11 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL  PN \nRevised  (06-18-25) PN 645"

Federal \nIncome Tax Returns with supporting documentation are the preferred verification source for prior income/previous employment. These documents along with award letters, court orders and/or paystubs (supported by oral verification when the applicant has been with the employer for less than a year or the verifications are inconsistent ) are preferre d when \nreviewing current income sources and projecting both annual  and repayment  income.  Written  \nVerifications  of Employment (VOE) provided  by third -party sources or other similar \ndocuments prepared by third- party sources are only required when the applicant is unable to \nprovide sufficient recent, reliable and consistent third -party  documentation which is readily \navailable to them (paystubs, award letters, etc.) . \n \n  \n \n4-21 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL  PN \nRevised  (11-06-24) PN 628 Examples  – Income  Exclusions  \n \n• The Value of Food Provided through the Meals on Wheels Program or Other  \nPrograms Providing Food for the Needy .

The value of this food is not counted as income.  \n• Deferred  periodic  payments  of social  security  benefits . Andrew  Ray received  \n$32,000 in deferred  social  security  benefits  following  a lengthy  eligibility  dispute.  This \ndelayed payment of social security benefits is treated as an asset, not as income.  \n• Income  from  training  programs .

The transcript should also be requested if the income verifications appear suspicious (e.g. there is evidence of alteration).  \n \nApplicant(s) not required to file should provide a letter of explanation. This explanation \nwill further be supported by documentation in the file obtained by the Loan Originator confirming the IRS filing thresholds based on income, applicable age, and fili ng status were \nnot exceeded by the applicant(s). Loan Originators may  obtain information for who is \nrequired to file a tax return for applicable tax years on the IRS website at https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/fact -sheets  (suggested key term search may include ‘…who \nneeds to file..’) . Past tax year Fact Sheets indicating filing thresholds can be located under \nthe \"News release and fact sheet archive\" link: https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/news -release-\nand-fact-sheet -archive.  \n \nAppendix 2 of this Handbook provides  sample  certification  and verification  formats  \nfor a number  of purposes.  \n \n  \n4-22"

Timing  \nDocumentation used to verify employment, income, assets, and deductions must be \nno more than 120 days old, or 180 days old for new construction, by closing date. If any \nof the verification documents are older than allowed, the Loan Originator must update \nthem before settlement. For example, if you have four paystubs to verify 30 days of income, the oldest paystub must be within 120 days (or 180 days for new construction) from date of closing to be valid. The age of certain documents, such as divorce decree and tax returns, \ndo not necessarily  affect  the validity  of the underwriting decision. These  types  of \ndocuments  are exempt  from  the document  age restriction  unless  there is evidence  that the \napplicant’s circumstances have changed thus warranting updated verifications.  \n \n2. Projecting  Expected  Income for the Next  12 Months  \n \nOnce an income source is verified, the Loan Originator must project the expected \nincome from this source for the next 12 months. This projection should be based on a comparison and analysis of the figures derived from using all applicable calculation metho ds. To establish earning trends and avoid miscalculating income, all four methods  \nshould be considered ; however,  some  income  sources  will only lend themselves to one \nmethod (such as;  seasonal income, retirement benefits, supplemental security income \n(SSI) or social security benefits) .  If all four methods are not used, the Loan Originator \nmust document why. In some cases, there may be multiple types of income generated from one source (overtime, bonus, hourly); therefore,  the income calculation method \nused will depend on the type of income received, rather than the source of income. The four calculation methods are:  \n \n• Straight -based  where  the benefit  or wage amount  is converted  to the annual \nequivalent.  This method is most appropriate when the hourly rate/number of \nhours worked, or the fixed weekly/monthly income is known and typically does not vary.  \n• Average where  the income  as reported  on the benefit  statements  or pay stubs  for \nthe last 30 days is averaged and then converted to the annual  equivalent. This  \nmethod is most appropriate when the wage rate/type (overtime, shift differential, SSI, etc.) or the number of hours worked vary from paycheck to paycheck.  \n \n \n  \n4-28"

The earning activity during the YTD interval should be closely examined to determine the appropriateness of this method. Do not use  \nthis method if the earning activity during the YTD interval is insufficient to make an annual  projection or is not reflect ive of the likely  earning  activity  for the period \noutside the YTD interval (the time between the last date covered by the most recent income verification and December 31 of the current year).  \n \n• Historical where the income  as reported  on the previous  year’s  tax return  is used. \nAny declining income trend, especially for repayment income, must be carefully document in the underwriting analysis.  \n \nIf the  applicant receives a fixed income,  such as social security benefits, it is not necessary \nto calculate all four methods. In the case of a fixed income, it would be appropriate to calculate the straight based and historical methods. If the two methods do not match (perhaps because of an incr ease in benefits for the current year), document the file accordingly. For seasonal  and \nself-employment , consider two years of historical records to include wages and unemployment. \nIt is not necessary to calculate the other three methods since you should not rely on paystub verification and the applicant may have multiple employers, making it difficult to verify from all sources. For all other incomes, calculate the four methods and compare the results. If there appear to be discrepancies, ask the applicant for addit ional information. For instance, if last \nyear’s income is $10,000 more than what was calculated using year to date information, ask the applicant if they have had a change in their hourly rate, number of hours declined or perhaps if their overtime is typically earned at the end of the year and is not yet reflected in the paystub. Document the results of the applicant interview and select the most appropriate income calculation after analyzing the data.  \n \nAfter the Loan Originator determines the suitable methods and performs the calculations, \nhe/she  must  determine  which  figure  is most  representative of income  likely to be received \nduring the next 12 months. If the figures are disparate and one figure is not clearly the most representative, an average of the resulting figures may be used. S electing  the lowest  figure  \nwithout  analysis  is not acceptable.  The selection  must  be carefully deliberated and may require \nadditional verification.  \n \n \n \n \n \n4-29 \n \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL PN  \nRevised  (11-06-24) PN 628"

His most recent paystub reflects  gross  YTD earnings  of $5,885.  \nMr. Anderson’s  tax return  for last year showed gross  wages  of \n$16,640.  \n Straight -based : Base  pay: $10/hour  x 40 hours/week  x 52 weeks/year  = $20,800 \n \nAverage : ($460  + $415 + $475 +  $445)  / 4) x 52 weeks/year = $23,335  \n \nYTD:  ($5,885 / 121 days)  x 365 =  $17,752  \n \nHistorical :  $16,640  \n Looking at the four results, there is no clear earning pattern.

Is B & N experiencing an unusual and temporary large workload?  Was Mr. Anderson \nabsent from work for an extended period of time?  Did Mr. Anderson recently receive a pay increase? Do \nhis recent paystubs include overtime earnings?  These are just a few examples of the questions that should \nbe answered.  \n \nNOTE:  These  calculations  should be documented using the Worksheet for Computing Income and \nMaximum Loan Amount Calculator  and included in the Electronic Customer  File (ECF)."

Dependents are members of the household who are not the \nborrower, co- borrower, or spouse, are age 17 or younger, are an individual with a disability, or \nare a full - time  student. The applicant/borrower, co-applicant/co -borrower,  or spouse  of \napplicant/borrower (even if the household member is temporarily absent) may never qualify as a dependent. A foster child, an unborn child, a child who has not yet joined the family, or a live -\nin aide may never be counted as a  dependent.  \n \n   \n               __________________________________________________________________________________________ \n                4-32"

To compute repayment income, the Loan Originator should count only the \nincome of persons who will be parties to the note. \nThe Standard PITI and TD ratio limitations assume  that applicant income is taxable.

If an applic ant will receive the credit, the \nbenefit of the credit will be “grossed up” for the repayment ability income calculation as described in Paragraph 4.4 H of this Chapter when  the applicant adjusts their Federal tax \nwithholdings via IRS Form W -4 to reflect the decrease in their tax liability.

    "content": "HB -1-3550  \nParagraph 4.5 Overview  of Policies  Related  to Assets  \n \n \nA. Reporting  Assets  \n \nApplicants must provide information about household assets at the time of loan \napplication and whenever an income determination is made. Applicants must provide sufficient \ndocumentation to enable the Loan Originator to verify the asset information and compute the market  and cash value of the asset.  Applicants  must  provide  assets  documentation as required  on \nParagraph 4.3 regardless of the balance or value of the assets disclosed. In addition, Form RD 3550- 4, Employment and Asset Certification, will be used to confirm the level of the \nhousehold’s combined net assets. \n \nB. Verification  of Assets  \nCopies of bank or brokerage company statements provide more information than just \naccount balances.  The transaction history reveals recurring deposits or debits that may impact \nthe applicant’s  ability  to qualify for a loan. Assets statements  must  cover  account  activity  for the \nmost  recent  two-month period  (or, if account  information  is reported  on a quarterly  basis,  for the \nmost recent quarter).  Loan originators must:  \n \n• Confirm  that the applicant  has enough funds  for closing.  \n• Obtain  a credible explanation from  the applicant  regarding the source  of funds  for any \nlarge, recurring deposits or increase in the account balance  that are not attributed to \nwages or earnings . A large deposit may be the proceeds from a new personal loan \nnot yet reported to the credit  bureaus  or indicate an unidentified income source . \n \nC. Calculating  Market  and Cash  Value  \n \nThe market  value  of an asset  is simply  its dollar  value  on the open market.  For example, \nthe market value of $2,000 in a savings account is $2,000 and the market value of real estate is \nits appraised value. The cash value of an asset is the market value, less reasonable expenses to \nconvert the asset to cash.  For example, the cash value of stock worth $5,000 would be $5,000 \nless any broker’s fee.  \n \n \n \n \n \n____________________________________________________________________________________________  \n4-41 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL PN  \nRevised (06- 18-25) PN 645  \n \n \n \n \n  \n  Example  – Assets that are Part  of an Active  Business  \nMegan  and Tylar  Wasson  own a copier  and courier  service.

Retirement  Assets  \nRetirement  assets  are savings  and \ninvestments that have been specifically \ndesignated as retirement funds. Access \nto retirement assets is restricted by law, employer policy, or both, depending on the retirement arrangement’s legal form. Typical restrictions include retirement age, vesting requirements, and ability to access funds.  \n \n4.6 LIMITATIONS  ON ASSETS  \nIf the cash value of non -retirement assets is greater than $15,000 for nonelderly \nhouseholds  or $20,000 for elderly  households, the cash value  in excess  of these amounts  must  be \nused toward the purchase of the property.  See P aragraph 6.10 B of this Handbook for list of \neligible asset uses.  \n \nApplicants  will not be required  to use retirement  assets as a down payment,  regardless  of \ntheir retirement status.  \n \n4.7 CALCULATING  INCOME  FROM  ASSETS  FOR  ANNUAL  INCOME  \nFor the purpose of computing annual income, the  cash value of all non -retirement \nassets of  all applicants  and co-applicants,  as well as all household members (adults and \nchildren) , are considered.  Reference Exhibit 4 -1 of this Chapter  for additional \ninformation. \n \nForm RD 3550- 4, Employment and Asset Certification should be used to certify \nthe cash value of the household’s family assets.  \n \n4.8 CALCULATING  INCOME  FROM  ASSETS  FOR  REPAYMENT  INCOME  \nWhen calculating assets  for repayment income, only the assets of the note signers  are \nconsidered, and the actual income derived from the assets, which are determined stable and dependable, are used.  \n \nNote: for non- retired applicants  income earned on a retirement account, from interest, \ndividends, or capital gains when funds can only be accessed by retiring, terminating employment, loaning against the account, or withdrawing with penalties is never considered for annual or repayment income.  \n \n4-42 \n \nTypical  Retirement  Plans  \n \n•Employer -sponsored retirement plans: 401(k), 403(b), 457 \nplans, employer and employee association trust accounts, \nmoney purchase plans, profit -sharing plans, SEP -IRAs \n(Simplified  Employee  Pensions)  and SIMPLE  IRAs (Savings \nIncentive Match Plans for Employees).  \n•Individual  Retirement  Arrangements  (IRAs):  Traditional IRA, \nRoth IRA, and Keogh plans.  \nExample  – Withdrawals  from  IRAs  or 401(k)  Accounts  \nJim Dunn retired recently. He has an IRA account but is not receiving periodic payments from it because  his pension \nis adequate for his routine  expenses.  However,  he has withdrawn  $2,000  for a trip with his children.

This section discusses the credit \nrequirements,  the additional  credit  checks,  how to conduct  the full credit  history review,  when \nto use Form RD 1944- 61, and the criteria for making credit exceptions. \n \n4.10 CREDIT  REQUIREMENTS  \n \nThe Loan Originator must evaluate the credit history of each proposed party to the \nnote. An applicant’s credit record does not have to be perfect; a few instances of credit problems can be acceptable if an applicant’s overall credit record demonstrates an ability and \nwillingness to repay obligations. Exhibit 4- 4 of this Chapter outlines indicators of \nunacceptable credit that must  be investigated  by the Loan  Originator. These  indicators  are not \nautomatic  disqualifiers. The Loan Approval Official can make exc eptions in limited \ncircumstances, as described in Paragraph 4.14 of this Chapter . \n \nThe Loan Originator must investigate \nindicators of unacceptable credit to determine whether they are accurate, and whether there is an acceptable explanation for the problem that might  justify  an exception. Failure  to understand \nthe nature of a credit problem could put the  \nAgency  at risk of providing financing to an applicant  who is unable  or unwilling  to repay  the \ndebt or  could cause the Agency to reject an applicant on the basis of inaccurate or \nincomplete information.  \n \nFor instance, an applicant with little or no credit history reflected on a credit report \nwill require further examination. Since some creditors do not report to the credit repositories, the Loan Originator should identify nontraditional credit sources to develop a credit history. Nontraditional  credit  information  that may demonstrate  the applicant’s  ability  and willingness \nto meet debt obligations should be verified using the guidelines in Paragraph 4.12 of this Chapter , which include  third  party  verifications  from  impartial and unrelated  parties,  canceled  \nchecks  that cover a sufficient period of time, or other acceptable means.  \n          \n____________________________________________________________________________________________  \n4-43 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL PN  \nRevised  (06-18-25) PN 645 \n \nCosigners  \nCosigners must meet the same credit - \nworthiness  requirements  as applicants  and cannot \nbe used to compensate for an applicant’s \nunacceptable credit history."

Loan Originators  should carefully  evaluate the \nbilling  statements to establish the payment history (past due amounts, late payment \ncharges) for the Loan Approval Official’s review. General statements such as \n“satisfactory” or “in good standing” are not sufficient to establish a satisfactory repayment \nhistory.  \n \nThe payment  history  should cover 12 months  within  the past 24 months  from  the date of \nthe application. However, other payment installments (such as quarterly or annually) can be \nconsidered when verifying nontraditional credit sources. When other payment installments \nare used, the length of the payment history should be adjusted accordingly. If the payments are made quarterly, verify that the last four payments were made. If the payments are made annually, verify that at least the last two payments were made . \nD. Non-Purchasing  Spouse  Credit  History  \n \nIn community property states, the non-purchasing spouse’s obligations must be considered \nin the total -debt ratio to determine the applicant’s purchasing capacity, unless excluded by State  \nlaw. However,  the non-purchasing  spouse’s  credit  history is never  considered a reason to deny a \nloan application. The Loan Originator must comply with applicable lending laws in community property states. \n \nTo assist the Agency in verifying the non- purchasing spouse’s obligations, and since UniFi  \nwill allow  the ordering  of credit  reports  on applicants  only, the applicant’s  non-purchasing spouse \nmust provide a copy of a credit report (or reports) which contains information from each of the \nnationwide consumer credit reporting companies – Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. \nThe application will be considered incomplete until this information is provided. Ideally, the non-\npurchasing spouse will be able to furnish a copy of their free report obtained through \nhttps://www.annualcreditreport.com . The provided report (or reports) cannot be more than nine \nmonths old  when the underwriting decision is to  be made or at the time of closing. The Housing \nProgram Director may waive this requirement on  a case-by case if obtaining the non-purchasing \nspouse’s  credit  report  isn’t feasible.  For instance, the non-purchasing spouse  is not a citizen  or is an \nemancipated minor. The non -purchasing spouse’s obligations will be evaluated in the same way the \napplicant’s debts are evaluated and in accordance with the guidance in Paragraph  4.22.B of this \nChapter. Unless excluded by State  law, judgments  of a non-purchasing spouse  in a community \nproperty state will be paid in full unless an exception is obtained from the Loan Approval Official.  \n   \n \n \n____________________________________________________________________________________________  \n4-55 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL  PN \nRevised  (06-18-25) PN 645"

Puerto Rico allows property to be owned as \ncommunity property as do several Indian jurisdictions. Alaska is an opt -in community property \nstate, where property is separate unless both parties agree to make it community property through a community property agreement or a community property trust. As laws vary from state to state, \nLoan Originators should contact the appropriate Office  of General Counsel with questions \nregarding the consideration of a non-purchasing spouse’s credit history.  \n \nExhibit 4 -5 \nGuidelines  for Evaluating Credit  Reports  \n• Different  credit  bureaus  or repositories  present  information  in different  formats.  Be familiar \nwith the different formats and take time in reviewing the report to avoid errors.  \n• Obtain clarification of any questionable items or terms (for example, terms such as “slow” or \n“late  pay”  have  varied  meanings).  No decisions  should  be made  until the terms  in question are \ntranslated into defined terms (e.g., for this repository, “slow pay” means 30 days late). Document clarification of terms in the casefile.  \n• Upon receiving  the credit  report,  verify  the name,  address,  and Social  Security  Number.  \n• Compare  the employment  information  and rental  data on the credit  report,  if available,  with \nthe information on the application.  \n• Compare  the remainder  of the credit  report  to the application.  Consider  the following  questions \nwhen reviewing the application.  \n◊ Are all the accounts  reported  on the credit  report  listed  on the application?  (Note:  There \nmay be additional accounts on the application that are not on the credit reports because \nnot all creditors furnish information to a credit bureau or repository.)  \n◊ Does  any of the information  on the credit  report  contradict  the application?  \n◊ What  information  indicates  unacceptable credit?  List late payments,  charge offs and \nother relevant information.  \n◊ Does the credit report have accounts included in a consumer credit counseling program? If so, document  a12-months  repayment  history  under  the plan with all payments  made  on time \nand the applicant has written permission from the counseling Agency to enter into a \nmortgage  transaction.  \n◊ Are there any disputed accounts?  \n◊ Is the applicant  responsible  for the trade  line or an authorized  user?  An authorized  user \naccount may not be considered when determining the applicant’s creditworthiness \nunless  the applicant provides supporting documentation to demonstrate that they have \nmade the monthly payments for the past 12 months.  \n• If the credit  report  reflects  no credit  history,  ask the applicant  for other  nontraditional credit  that \nmay demonstrate a willingness to pay recurring debts like rent, utilities, phone, medical, etc. Third party verifications from impartial and unrelated parties or canceled checks that cover a \nsufficient period of time are acceptable forms of  documentation.  \n• Review the number and dates of credit inquiries. The presence of many and recent credit \ninquiries  in different  industries  may indicate  that the applicant  is looking  for credit  to finance \npurchases.  Confirm  that the applicant has not obtained  new credit  that is yet to be reflected  in \nthe credit report.  \n• Highlight  areas  of concern  and develop  a list of questions  or issues  that need  clarification \nfrom the applicant.  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n4-56"

The Loan Originator should \ncomplete this form and include it in the case file to aid the Loan Approval Official in reviewing \nthe applicant’s credit history. The Loan Approval Official  must confirm the completeness and \naccuracy of this form before making a credit decision. \n4.14 ASSESSING  ADVERSE  CREDIT  \nA. Making  Exceptions  \n \nThe Loan Originator should review the credit history for any signs of unacceptable \ncredit  using the criteria  outlined  in Exhibit  4-4. Credit  history problems  may be more  reflective \nof an inability than an unwillingness to meet financial obligations. However, derogatory credit may also be the result of extenuating circumstances causing a significant reduction in income and/or increase in financial obligations. Extenuating c ircumstances are events beyond the \napplicant’s control and unlikely to reoccur. The applicant must provide a letter to explain the nature of the event that led to the derogatory credit and provide supporting documentation accordingly. The Loan Approval Official  must  carefully review  the documentation provided by \nthe applicant to confirm that the adverse credit was in fact due to extenuating circumstances (e.g. the dates of the derogatory credit must be consistent with the dates of the event) and not financial mismanagement. The loan f ile must include an underwriting analysis explaining the \nrationale for the credit exception and determination that the events causing the financial \ndifficulties were, in fact, beyond the applicant’s control and are unlikely to reoccur.  \n \nThe Loan  Approval  Official may consider  an exception in the following \ntypes of situations. \n \n• Reduced  shelter costs.  The applicant’s  rental  or mortgage  payment  history has been \nunacceptable,  and the loan will significantly reduce the applicant’s shelter costs, which \nwill result in improved debt repayment ability. Anticipated utility cost savings due to energy efficiency improvements (e.g. furnace replacement, insulation, energy efficient wind ows, etc.) may also be considered a reduced shelter cost for an existing homeowner.  \n• Temporary  situation.  The circumstances  that caused  the credit  problems  were \ntemporary  in nature and beyond the applicant’s control. Examples include loss of job, \ndelay or reduction in benefits, illness, or dispute over payment of defective goods or services.  \n \n \n  \n              ____________________________________________________________________________________________  \n4-57 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL  PN \nRevised  (06-18-25) PN 645"

The applicant is delinquent on a Federal debt, and the \nAgency  loan will allow  the applicant  to take actions  that benefit  the Government. \nThis type of exception can only be made by the Administrator.  \n \nThe Loan Approval Official is not authorized to make an exception in the case of an \napplicant  with an outstanding judgment  obtained by the United  States  in a Federal  court, other  than \nthe United States Tax Court. \nB. Reviewing  Significant  Delinquencies  \n \n1. Chapter  7 Bankruptcy  \n \nA Chapter 7 bankruptcy, also known as liquidation bankruptcy, eliminates all of an individual’s \nunsecured debt. Applicants with a Chapter 7 bankruptcy discharged more than 36 months prior to \nthe loan application are not considered to have unacceptable credit as long as they have re - \nestablished  good credit.  Re-establishing  good credit  includes  consistently  making payments  on time, \nnot incurring additional or excessive debt, and keeping balances significantly below the credit limit.  \n \nIf the bankruptcy has been discharged less than 36 months from the date of application, the \nLoan Approval Official may make a credit exception if the bankruptcy was due to extenuating circumstances  and the applicant  has been  able to re-establish  good credit  since the factors  leading to \nthe extenuating circumstance were removed.  The loan file must include the loan documentation \nrequirements for making a credit exception using extenuating circumstances. \n \n2. Chapter  13 Bankruptcy  \n \nA Chapter 13 bankruptcy is a repayment plan that protects individuals from collection action \nduring the plan period, from three to five years, and discharges any unpaid balance at the end of the plan. The repayment  amount  is determined by the court based on the  individual’s  income. An \napplicant  with  a Chapter  13 Bankruptcy reported  on the  credit  profile  may  be able to  qualify  for a \nloan if the following requirements are met:\n \n• Successful  completion  of the debt restructuring  plan. The completion  date is the \nbankruptcy discharge date;  and \n• Demonstrate  willingness  to meet  obligations  when  due for the 12 months  prior  to \nthe date of application. The last 12- month payments made under the bankruptcy \nrestructuring plan may be used to document the applicant’s willingness to repay debt. This means that all required payments were made on time and for the amount agreed upon under the plan.  \nA Chapter 13 bankruptcy is not considered unacceptable credit, and a credit exception is \nnot required, when the aforementioned requirements have been met. However, the applicant must  obtain written  permission from  the Bankruptcy Court  to enter  into a financial  obligation \nwith the Agency.  \n_____________________________________________________________________________________  \n4-58"

    "content": "HB-1-3550  \nParagraph  4.14 Assessing  Adverse  Credit  \n \n3. Significant  Mortgage  Delinquency  \nA foreclosure is a significant mortgage delinquency. Other significant mortgage \ndelinquencies  are deeds -in-lieu of foreclosure,  short  sales,  and mortgage  charge- offs. These \nare significant mortgage delinquency events that, when present in the credit report,  \ndrastically increase the risk of a loan and must be carefully considered in the loan risk \nanalysis when reviewing the loan application. For any significant mortgage delinquency \ntransaction, the Loan Originator must confirm that the applicant has been compl etely \nreleased from the previous mortgage liability and is not responsible for any deficiency judgement. The following describes the most common significant mortgage delinquency actions reported to the credit bureaus that are used as an alternative to a fo rmal foreclosure \nbecause they reduce the time and cost of repossessing a property and borrowers avoid the public notoriety of a foreclosure:  \n• Deed -in-lieu of Foreclosure. In a “deed -in-lieu of foreclosure” transaction the \nborrower voluntarily transfers the property rights back to the creditor in an exchange for a mortgage  cancellation.  These transactions  are most  common when  the property \nsubject  to the potential foreclosure has positive equity or if the homeowner meets the \nrequirements for financial hardship relief.  \n• Short Sale . Short sale is a term used to describe a sale where the debt owing against a \nproperty combined with the costs associated with the sale exceeds the property’s market value. Short sales are also known as pre -foreclosure sales because the lender \nhas not completed  the foreclosure  process  but plans  to foreclose if the property  is not \nsold by the homeowner under the terms approved by the lien holders. Depending on \nthe short sale agreement, the applicant may still be responsible for the amount that “fel l \nshort” as a result of the short sale transaction. The loan deficiency remaining after the sale is typically forgiven; however, this is not always the case.\n \n• Mortgage Charge -Off. A mortgage charge -off is a debt classification used by \ncreditors  when  they believe  a mortgage  debt is not collectible.  This action  does not \nmean  that the debt is no longer  valid  or that has been  forgiven.  An applicant  with a \nmortgage charge -off reported on the credit report may still be responsible for the debt.  \nIf the significant mortgage delinquency was due to the applicant’s failure to meet \nfinancial obligations, the applicant is not eligible for a loan for 36 months from the date the obligation was released.  However,  if the delinquency was due to extenuating circumstances, \nthe applicant may be eligible for a loan if:  \n• More  than 12 months  have  elapsed  between  the date the applicant  was \nreleased  from the mortgage debt and the application date;  and, \n• The applicant  has demonstrated  an ability  and willingness  to meet  \nobligations  when due for the 12 months prior to the date of application; and, \n• The circumstances  leading  to the delinquency are properly documented and  justified.  \n \n4-59 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL  PN \nRevised  (06-18-25) PN 645"

An applicant who owns a dwelling generally is not eligible for a \nSection 502 loan, except for refinancing assistance, as described in Paragraph 6.5 B  of this \nChapter . However, if the applicant’s dwelling is structurally unsound, functionally inadequate, \nor too small to accommodate the needs  of the household, funds  may be provided to improve  \nthe existing  dwelling  or to purchase a new one.  \nThe following are examples  where the Agency  can assist  an applicant  in the purchase  of a \nnew home  provided,  they meet  all other  eligibility  criteria,  and the existing  property is properly \nhandled  \n• An applicant  lives  adjacent  to an industrial  operation. The  business’s  operations  result \nin vibrations  that have caused the foundation of the applicant’s  home to severely shift \ncausing cracks in the home and an unsafe living condition. \n• An applicant  lives  in a two-story  dwelling  which  is not accessible to a household \nmember with a disability.  \n• An applicant  lives  in a manufactured  home  that is not affixed  to a permanent \nfoundation.  \n• An applicant  is dealing  with an overcrowded situation  now that their family  has grown \n(i.e., there are more than two household members per bedroom).  \n \nThe existing property must be (1) sold prior or simultaneously/same day as the  Agency’s \nloan closing and the proceeds in excess of the program’s asset threshold are used for a down payment  or used for allowed purposes ; or (2) the sale of the home is a loan closing condition.

The amount of the lien placed against the property is based on the current market  value, \nminus typical closing costs, minus the program’s asset threshold.  If the property is sold, future proceeds from the sale in excess of the program’s asset threshold are  to be  used as a principal \nreduction.

All applicants are presumed to be \nunable to obtain credit from other sources unless all four conditions apply: (1) the household is Low income; (2) all applicant s have a credit score that is 640 or higher; (3) payment assistance \nis not needed and (4 ) applicant s have a one year employment history (two years for self -\nemployed applicants) .  \n \nIf the applicant (s) meets all four conditions, the Loan Approval Official should request \nthe applicant to provide written documentation from a lender that they are unable to obtain credit for the same loan amount as they would obtain from Rural Development, without regard to the interest rate, closing costs or payment. If the applicant can obtain financing from other \nsources for the same loan amount or greater, the applicant is deemed to have the ability to obtain other credit.  \nApplicants must reduce the need for credit by using available non- retirement assets, as \ndescribed  in Section  2. In addition, applicants  should be encouraged  to obtain a portion of the \nneeded funds in the form of affordable housing products. \n \n4.17 OCCUPYING  THE  PROPERTY  \n \nTo be eligible for a Section 502 loan, applicants must agree and have the ability to \noccupy the dwelling as their principal residence. A dwelling is considered a principal \nresidence when  physically occupied  by the owner  on a permanent  basis  (i.e. lives  there for the \nmajority of the year and is the address of record for such activities as Federal income tax reporting, voter registration, occupational licensing, etc.).  \n \n4.18 LEGAL CAPACITY  \n \nTo be eligible  for a  loan, the applicant  must  be considered  an adult  under  State law, and \nmust have the legal capacity to incur the loan obligation.

Repayment income, as described in Paragraph 4.4 H. of this Chapter , \nis the amount of income parties to the note will have available to repay the debt. \n \nHowever,  other  household expenses  and debts \nand the availability of payment subsidies also greatly \naffect an applicant's repayment ability. The Agency bases underwriting decisions on an analysis of the percentage  of income  the applicant  would  be required  \nto spend on housing costs  and the applicant’s  Total  Debt  (TD) if the loan is approved. Using  these  2 \npercentages, called ratios, is a standard practice throughout the lending industry. Borrowers must meet the Agency’s standards for both ratios. \n \nA. The PITI  Ratio  \n \nThe PITI ratio compares the amount the \napplicant must spend on housing costs (including Principal  on the loan, Interest  on the \nloan, real estate Taxes,  and property Insurance) \nand flood Insurance (as applicable) to the applicant's repayment income.

Using  Compensating  Factors  \nExceptions  to the standard  method of determining  repayment  ability  may be made if there \nis information -- called compensating factors --  that indicates the prospective borrower may be \nable to make larger regular loan payments than the ratio analysis suggests. Compensating factors \nmust be clearly documented in the applicant’s case file.  \nAll compensating factors must be approved by the next level supervisor. To obtain \napproval, the Loan Originator must prepare a written request that supports the use of compensating factors,  and the higher  amount  requested.  The Loan  Originator  should forward  the \nrequest and case file to the next level supervisor for approval.  \nSome  of the compensating  factors  that can affect  the amount  of debt an applicant  is permitted  to \nhave are discussed below:  \n1. Payment  History  \nThe PITI and TD ratio analyses assume that households are able to contribute a \nspecified percentage of income toward housing costs. However, if an applicant has historically  paid a greater  share of income  for housing with the same income  and debt \nlevel, a higher payment may be approved. Utility and maintenance costs must be considered as part of this analysis. \n \n4-69 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL  PN \nRevised  (06-18-25) PN 645 Exhibit  4-6 \nEstablishing  a Minimum  Area Loan  Amount  \nEach Field Office should set, following the methodology provided by their State Office,  a \nminimum loan amount in each area that is “clearly less than” the amount needed to  purchase a decent, \nsafe, and sanitary dwelling in that area. For example, if a county’s area loan limit is  \n$265,000,  but based  on an examination  of properties  financed  by the Agency  in that county  during the last \n12 months shows that the lowest amount of financing needed to purchase a decent, safe, and sanitary \nhome was $75,000, a minimum loan amount of $60,000 may be set. Consideration should be made for \nproperties with a purchase price below the m inimum loan amount parameters when, if repaired (using \nloan funds or other means), would provide a decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling. For example, the Minimum Area Loan Limit is $60,000, the applicant signs a purchase agreement for $55,000; however, the \nlocal housing authority is providing repair funds to replace the roof and furnace in the amount of $15,000. \nThe Field Office should consider financing the property, s ince the repair funds will bring the property value \nabove the minimum area loan limit.  \nIf the applicant does not qualify for the minimum loan amount and the Loan Originator has \nconcluded that compensating factors  are not applicable  and adding  a party  to the application  is not viable, \nthe Loan Approval Official must sign and send Handbook Letter 15 (3550), Standardized Adverse \nDecision Letter, to the applicant along with Attachment 1 -B. The letter should state that the applicant’s \nqualifying loan amount (be sure to enter tha t amount) is not sufficient to meet the program’s purpose as \noutlined in the 7 CFR Part 3550, Paragraph 3550.2."

Savings  History  \nApplicants with accumulated \nsavings and a savings history that  \nshows a capacity to set aside a larger - \nthan- average portion of income  may be \napproved for a higher payment. \n3. Job Prospects  \nIf an applicant has recently entered \na profession in which they can expect \nsignificant pay increases, the Loan Originator  may base repayment  income  \non the  anticipated  future  earnings  of that applicant. \nSimilarly,  if overtime  income  is available to increase  the applicant’s  income, the \nLoan Originator may project the household’s income with extra overtime included.  \n4. Homes  Constructed  Under  Specific Energy  Efficiency  Programs  \nA new home  built to exceed  the prevailing  International  Energy Conservation Code is \nmore energy efficient,  which significantly lowers the homeowner’s utility costs. The \nlower utility costs associated with these energy efficient homes indicate that a prospective borrower will be able to make larger loan payments than the ratio analysis suggests.  \n \nGiven  their resulting  energy  efficiency  savings  of up to 30 percent  relative  to typical  \nnew homes, as well as their progressive and routinely updated building standards, new \nhomes constructed under the following national programs will be considered as a compensating factor:\n \n• Energy Star for New  Homes  under  the U.S. Environmental  Protection \nAgency ( https://www.energystar.gov/newhomes ) \n• Zero  Energy  Ready  Home  under  the U.S. Department  of Energy \n(https://www.energy.gov/eere/buildings/zero- energy -ready - homes ) \n• Leadership  in Energy and  Environmental  Design  (LEED)  for \nResidential Design and Construction : (LEED Certification for \nResidential )  \n• Home  Innovation’s  “National  Green  Building Standard”  under  the National \nAssociation of Home Builders  https://www.nahb.org/advocacy/industry-\nissues/sustainability -and-green -building )  \n \n                     ____________________________________________________________________________________________  \n4-70\nExample  - Using  Savings  History \nAs A Compensating Factor  \nAn applicant is currently paying $400 per \nmonth in rent and putting $175 per month in a \nsavings  account.  Utility  costs  should be similar \nto those the applicant is currently paying, but \nmaintenance costs  will be about  $50 per month \nhigher.  According to ratios, the applicant’s \nrepayment  ability  is $500 per month.  However, \nsince the applicant is currently using a total of  \n$575 per month for a combination of rent and \nsavings,  a loan that requires  a monthly payment \nof up to $525 ($575- $50) may be considered."

Once  construction is complete,  the Field  Office  must  obtain verification \nthat the property is certified through one of the above programs.  \nB. Adding  Additional  Parties  or Cosigners  to the Note  \nAdditional  financial  resources  may be added  by adding additional  parties  to the note \nor locating cosigners.  \n1. Additional  Parties  to the Note  \nAdditional  parties  to the note must  agree to occupy  the dwelling  and must  qualify as \nborrowers, as described in this chapter. Counting the income of the additional parties increases repayment income.  \n2. Cosigners  \nIndividuals who will not reside in the dwelling, but who are willing to be responsible for the debt may be cosigners to the note. To supplement the applicant’s purchasing power, a cosigner  must  demonstrate  an ability  and willingness  to meet  debt \nobligations  as outlined in Section 3 and possess a TD ratio that does not exceed 41 \npercent. The cosigner’s TD calculation would include the applicant’s full note payment through Rural Development, the applicant’s leveraged loan payments (if applicable), the applicant’s escrow  payment,  and all of the cosigner’s  long- term (non-\nmedical)  obligations  (including their mortgage) as well as their short -term (non-\nmedical) obligations that have a significant impact on repayment ability.   In the event \nof default, a cosigner is not entitled to any interest in the security or borrower rights.  \nAgain, cosigners  can only be  used  to improve  the applicant’s  purchasing power.  \nCosigners  cannot  be used to compensate for an  applicant’s  unacceptable  credit  history.  \n \nC.

In this scenario, the applicant’s payment shock is 130 percent:  \n \n($550 + 250 + 120)  / 400 = 2.30;  2.30 – 1 =  1.30 = 130 percent  \n \nIn cases  where  payment  shock is greater  than 100 percent  or could not be measured  since \nthe applicant does not currently have any housing expenses, no additional risk layering ( i.e., \nadverse credit waivers, use of compensating factors, etc.) should be allowed without strong justification. Multiple layers of risk may be justified if the applicant has an excellent credit history reflecting timely repayment of credit obligations or a cre dit score of 640 or higher on \ntheir TMCR. Perhaps the applicant has demons trated a careful attitude toward the use of credit \nand an ability to accumulate savings or a stable employment history over the past two years, demonstrating a dependable income stream. Regardless of the justification, the Loan Approval Official must thoro ughly document their rationale for allowing multiple layers of risk in the \nrunning case record.  \n \n4.25 ISSUING  THE  CERTIFICATE  OF ELIGIBILITY  \n \nIf the Loan  Originator  determines  that an applicant  is eligible  for a loan, the decision  will \nbe documented in the form of a written narrative in the running record of the applicant case file.  \n \nWhen  funds  are available,  eligible  applicants  who have  not yet located  properties  or, \nwho own their building site but have not  provided a  construction package, should be issued \nForm RD 1944- 59, Certificate of Eligibility.  First -time homebuyers must be informed that by \naccepting a Certificate of Eligibility  (COE) they agree to provide documentation of \ncompletion of an approved homeownership education course prior to entering into a contract to purchase or construct a home for maximum benefit (or shortly the reafter).\n The Loan \nOriginator must note on the running record that they informed the Applicant of the homeownership education requirement.  \n \nThe certificate  is valid for a period of 12 0 days  for all applications . Within that time the \napplicant must provide sufficient information to enable the Agency to conduct an appraisal of  \nthe property to be financed. The COE  will be honored even if loan limits change before the  \nexpiration of the commitment.  If the applicant has already submitted a contract for a property, Form RD 1944- 59 will not be issued. If an applicant’s sales contract falls through, a new Form \nRD 1944- 59, good for 12 0 days , should be i ssued  only if funding is available.  If funding is \nunavailable at the time a sales contract falls through,  Appendix 3 Handbook Letter 2 (3550)  of \nthis Handbook, Funds Not Available, should be issued.

Loan Originators must understand the applicant’s business structure to effectively document, \ncalculate, and analyze annual and repayment income. The following are the most common business structures for self -employed applicants. \n \na. Sole Proprietorship: The business structure most often encountered is a sole \nproprietorship (be it a business, farming, or profession). A sole proprietor is someone who owns  an unincorporated business  by himself  or herself  and has unlimited  personal \nliability for all debts of the business. Business income or loss is folded into the individual owner's tax return.  \n \nb. Partnership : A partnership is an arrangement between two or more individuals who \nhave  put together  their assets  and/or  skills  to operate a business  and who will share,  as \nstated in the agreement, profit and losses. Each partner reports their share of the partnership’s income or loss on their personal tax return. Partners are not employees and do not receive a Form W -2. Both general and limited partnerships report income on \nthe IRS Form 1065, “US Return of Partnershi p Income” which must be reviewed to \nassess the viability of the business. A Schedule K -1 (1065) shows the partner’s share of \nincome, loss, deductions, credits and other items from the partnership business or rental activities. The partner’s share of income is carried over to Schedule E of IRS Form 1040. \n \nc. Limited Liability Corporation (LLC ): An LLC is a legal business structure which can \nbe formed by one or more individuals and is designed to offer  its members  (owners)  the \ntax efficiencies  of a partnership and the limited  liability advantages of a corporation. \nThe LLC tax return filing requirements depend on how it is legally structured.   \n___________________________________________________________________________________________  \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL PN  \nRevised  (06-02-23) PN 583"

LLC profits are allocated to each of the owners according to the profit -sharing arrangement set up in the LLC operat ing \nagreement. \nThe LLC prepares and files IRS Form 1065, Partnership Information Return each \nyear, and each owner is given a Schedule K -1, which shows each owner’s share of LLC \nincome. The partner’s share of income is carried over to Schedule E of their IRS Form \n1040.  \n• An LLC can also be treated as either a C or S Corporation with the same tax return filing requirements, but this requires the entity to file an IRS Form 8832 “Entity Classification Election” checking the corporate income tax treatment box on the form. Afte r making this \nelection, profits kept in the business are taxed at the separate income tax rates that apply to corporations. If you receive an application from someone whose business income is derived from an LLC, determining the business structure is impor tant to know which \ntypes of business tax returns will be reviewed.  \n \nd. S-Corporation: An S Corp is a legal entity that has a limited number of stockholders \n(up to 75) and elects  not to be taxed  as a regular  corporation. An S -Corporation is \ngenerally a small, start -up business, with gains and losses that are passed onto the \nstockholders in proportion to each stockholder’s percentage of business ownership and it is taxed at their individual tax rates. The income for the owners is reflected on a W -2 \nand is taxes at the individual rate but  may require adjustments based on any gains or \nlosses of the business. This is another commonly encountered type of business. \n \nStep  2: Document  Self-Employment  Income:  \n \nThe Loan Originator must obtain the two most recent signed copies of the individual and business \ntax returns  filed with the IRS and all supporting schedules, as applicable . If the applicant does not \nhave copies of their tax returns, the Loan Originator may obtain IRS transcripts obtained directly from the IRS with all supporting schedules. For electronically filed tax returns, it is not necessary to require the applicant(s) to manually sign the return for application purposes if there is sufficient  \ndocument ation  the applicant  has signed the return  electronically  (i.e., use of Self-Select PIN for \nFree File Fillable Forms, Electronic Filing PIN, or authorized E -File Provider). Federal Income \nTax Returns for the individual and business will be required when ownership is 25 percent or greater.  The following table provides general  guidance regarding the  minimum \ndocumentation  required for self -employed applicants for each  business structure  and \nwhere the profit and loss will be reflected  on each tax form . (Please note that the IRS tax  \nforms can change the numbering or placement of this information)."

The Verification of Business Expenses, located in  \nAppendix 8 of this Handbook, provides a sample format for recording business expenses . The \nprofit and loss and balance statement or Verification of Business Expenses must be signed by the \nowner of the business or a tax pro fessional ( not require d to be audited) .  The year -to-date profit \nand loss statement and Verification of Business Expenses is only used to analyze the income trend of the business  when calculating annual income if  there is a significant increase or decrease \nin self -employment income . Repayment income should only be based on the reported earnings of \nthe previous two years of filed tax returns, unless the L oan Originator documents that the \napplicant has  two years of previous successful employment  in a similar  line of work. The \napplicant’s  individual  tax returns  must  reflect  a history of receiving income at the same (or \ngreater) level in a field that provides the same products or services as the current business.  \nThe income  for an applicant  that has been  self-employed for less than one year  is not to be \nconsidered stable for repayment purposes.  \n \nStep  3: Calculate  Self-Employment  Income:  \n \nIndividuals and businesses complete tax forms to calculate taxable income or loss. Tax forms by themselves do not wholly reflect the amount of income  the Loan Originator may use  toward \nrepayment.   To calculate self-employment  income,  it is necessary  to make a cash flow analysis  of \nthe applicant’s incom e. \n \n The Loan  Originator  needs  to make certain  adjustments  to the income  (or loss)  reported  in IRS \nForm 1040 in order to have an accurate picture of the applicant’s cash flow. The IRS allows self-employed applicants and business owners to make non- cash deductions to reduce taxable \nincome. There are some non -cash deductions that can be added back into repayment income but \nare not added back to the annual income calculation. Depreciation  and depletion are classic \nexamples  of non- cash deductions  that reduce taxable income but increase the applicant’s income \nfor loan qualification purposes.   The Loan Originator must carefully review all tax forms to identify non- cash deductions \n(increasing income) and/or additional expenses (reducing income). The following are the most common adjustments to the net profit/income reported in the applicable tax forms/schedules:  \n \n \n \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL  PN \nRevised  (06-02-23) PN 583"

A negative amount (loss) must not  be used to offset other family income for repayment \nand/or annual income.  \n \nStep  4: Analyze the Self-Employment  Income:  \n \nWhen analyzing self -employment income the Loan Originator must perform a detailed review of \nthe applicant’s individual and business tax returns to confirm that the income is stable and dependable (likely to continue). \n \nIn general, income from self -employment is considered stable if the applicant has been self- \nemployed for two or more years.  Because self-employment income may change each year,  the \nLoan Originator should always develop an average annual income by using at least two full years of the applicant’s self -employment income. An average takes in consideration typical \nmarket fluctuations, thus better predicting the applicant’s long- term earning ability.  \n \nDependable income refers to the likelihood of continuity of the income. Making this determination requires the Loan Originator to predict future income. The Loan Originator should look at income trends and the stability of the income source. Any specific indication of an upcoming event  that might change the applicant’s employment or income should be addressed \nin the loan file and considered in the underwriting decision. For example, if the most recent tax return shows an income considerable higher than reported in the previous tax year, the Loan Originator should investigate further to determine whether the higher income is due to business expansion or a onetime event unlikely to reoccur and continue. Income from a nonrecurring transaction should be excluded from the income calculations. Similarly, a nonrecurring loss should not be deducted from the income calculation."

The Agency \nimposes quality and value requirements to protect the borrower’s interest and, in the event of liquidation, the Agency’s interest. \nA. Overview  of Property  Requirements\n1.Ensuring  Quality\nFour sections of this chapter deal with quality assurance. Section 1 describes the\nrequirements for approving a site -- its location, its size and amenities, and the adequacy of available utility systems. Section 2 describes the requirements  for the dwelling itself, which  \nmust be modest, but also decent,  safe, and sanitary.  The standards that apply differ somewhat \ndepending upon whether the dwelling will be newly constructed or is an existing home. Section 3 describes the Agency’s requirements for the protection of environmental resources and the due diligence required with regard to hazardous substances. Section 6 provides guidance for monitoring construction activities  to ensure that any construction or repair  work \nis appropriately conducted and completed.  \n2.Ensuring  Adequate  Value\nBefore the Agency makes a loan, the Loan Originator must ensure that the applicant\nwill have an appropriate form  of ownership and that the Agency’s  interest  in the property is \nadequately secured by the value of the real estate and the Agency’s lien position. Section  4 specifies  Agency  security  requirements  and Section  5 provides guidance on \nconducting appraisals of the property’s value. \nB. Key Processing  Steps  Related  to Property  Requirements\nWhen applicants locate properties, they must provide the Loan Originator with the basic\ninformation needed to initiate the Agency’s review of the property. Applicants who do not currently own the property must submit an option or sales contract. Applicants who already own the property must submit evidence of ownership, a legal  description, and a property  survey  showing \nall structures on the site. Within 3 business days of the applicant identifying the property, the Loan Originator must send the applicant the items listed in Parag raph 3.8 A. \nThe Loan Originator will use the USDA Address Verification website \n(https://eligibility.sc.egov.usda.gov/eligibility/addressVerification ) to verify  the p\n roperty  address.

Appraisal  \nIn general, appraisals are ordered under the nationwide contract with Appraisal \nManagement Companies (AMCs). Field Staff request an appraisal through the Procurement \nManagement Office’s (PMO) Procurement Requests SharePoint site  using the current SFH \nAppraisal  Request  form  (which  can be found in the Direct  Training Hub in SharePoint  along \nwith other appraisal training materials) and uploads all applicable supporting documents. \nThe AMC  Administration  Team  (consisting of PMO  and National  Office staff) then orders \nthe appraisal through the applicable AMC portal. \nUnder the nationwide contract,  the AMCs  are generally  required  to follow Attachment \n5-A (though contract terms may differ). The AMC Administration Team monitors the \nAMCs’ contract performance, reconciles invoices, handles payments, and handles all \ncommunications with the AMCs. Field Staff are not to communicate with the AMCs or  \ntheir subcontracted appraisers; Field Staff must direct their general appraisal communications to rd.appraisals@usda.gov or to the Regional Appraisal Services\n \nSharePoint site for requesting a technical  review.  If the communication  is time sensitive  (e.g. \nrequest for a correction or revision), use “Urgent” in the subject line. \n \n The estimated remaining economic life found in the ‘Cost Approach’ section of the \nappraisal report is required and must be equal to or greater than the repayment period of the \nloan (see Paragraph  6.8 of this Handbook). \n \n2. Review  of Property  and Site for Compliance with  Agency  Standards  \nBefore loan approval, the Loan Originator must confirm that the property meets, or will \nmeet with any planned construction or repairs, all applicable Agency requirements. This is accomplished  through a review  of opinions or determinations  made by qualified  third  parties \n(such as appraisers, local building officials, architectural and engineering professionals, and trades professionals). \n \n3. Identification  and Correction  of Deficiencies  \n \nIf at any point during the review  process,  deficiencies  are identified  that jeopardize the \nAgency’s ability  to approve a loan, the Loan  Originator must notify the applicant  and give \nthe applicant at least 15 days to resolve the deficiency. For example, if an inspection \nreveals  a structural  deficiency  that can be corrected,  the applicant  could negotiate with  the \nseller to reduce the sales price so that funds to correct the deficiency could be included in the loan, or to correct the deficiency before the property is transferred. \nIf a deficiency  cannot be satisfactorily  corrected,  the Loan  Originator notifies the \napplicant and provides a new Form RD 1944- 59, Certificate of Eligibility, which is \nsigned by the Loan Approval Official. \n \n5-2"

Documenting  the Acceptability  of Seller Completed  Repairs  \n \nAs part of the contract negotiations, a seller often agrees to complete repairs \nidentified by the buyer at the time of signing the sales contract or later identified by the \nbuyer’s  inspectors  (refer  to Paragraph  5.7 A. of this H ) and agreed  to through an \naddendum  to the contract. The Field Office should ensure that the repair conditions in \nthe contract or addendum provide the specifics necessary for the seller to properly \naddress the repair.  \nIdeally,  the contract  or addendum  will detail  the existing  problem, how the repair  will be \ncompleted, who will perform the work (a licensed contractor should perform work that demands technical expertise), and how the repairs will be verified. If the repair conditions are vague or ambiguous, the Field Office should encourage the buyer to seek an addendum that better defines the repair conditions. \n \nBefore loan closing can occur, receipts for the repair work and any associated \npermit/contract documents must be obtained from the seller and reviewed by the Field Office. Documentation on all agreed to repairs must be provided. In addition, the buyer must be instructed to inspect the completed work and provide the Field Office with a written statement of acceptance or a written statement outlining deficiencies in the seller completed  repairs.  If deficiencies  are noted, the buyer  and seller  must  work  to address  the \ndeficiencies before loan closing can occur.  \n \nSpecial  care should be given if completion  of repair  work  cannot  take place  until after \nthe loan closing to ensure there are adequate funds. Closing agents should be instructed to release the funds to the contractor only after receiving written instructions from the \nLoan Approval Official. The Loan Approval Official may authorize the release of funds \nonce the work, as indicated in the contract, is completed. The case file should be documented with invoices and the borrower’s acceptance that the work has been completed to their satisfaction.  \n \n  \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n5-3 \n \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL  PN \nRevised  (03-19-20) PN 534"

The site must be developed according to the development standards \nimposed by State or local government. These standards are often contained in zoning ordinances, building codes, subdivision regulations, and/or construction standards. In addition, the site must be located in a rural area; be modest; meet minimum standards regarding water and wastewater \nsystems;  and meet  the Agency’s  street  and access  requirements  of being on an all-weather  road that \nis maintained by a public body or homeowner’s association. This section addresses these site requirements.  \n5.3 RURAL  AREA DESIGNATION  \nA.Rural  Area  Definition  [7 CFR 3550.10]\nRural  areas  are defined  as:\n•Open  country or any town, village,  city, or place,  including the immediate  adjacent\ndensely settled area, which is not part of or associated with an urban area and\nwhich:\nA.Has a population not in excess  of 2,500 inhabitants; or\nB.Has a population in excess  of 2,500 but not in excess  of 10,000 if it is rural  in\ncharacter;  or\nC.Has a population in excess  of 10,000 but not in excess  of 20,000, and-\nIs not contained  within  a Metropolitan  Statistical Area (MSA);  and\nH\nas a serious lack  of mortgage credit  for lower  and moderate-income families  as\ndetermined  by the Secretary  of Agriculture  and the Secretary  of Housing and \nUrban  Development.  \n•Any area classified as ‘‘rural’’ or a ‘‘rural area’’ prior to October 1, 1990, and\ndetermined  not to be ‘‘rural’’ or a ‘‘rural  area’’ as a result  of data received  from  or after\nthe 1990, 2000, 2010, or 2020 decennial census, and any area deemed to be a ‘‘rural\narea’’ at any time during the period beginning January 1, 2000, and ending December31, 2020, shall continue to be so classified until the receipt of data from the de cennial\ncensus in the year 2030, if such area has a population in excess of 10,000 but not inexcess of 35,000, is rural in character, and has a serious lack of mortgage credit for\nlower and moderate- income families.\n5-4"

Open space \nincludes undeveloped land, agricultural land, or sparsely settled areas. Open space does not include physical barriers (such as rivers or canals), public parks, commercial and industrial developments, small areas reserved for recreational purposes, and open space set aside for \nfuture development. \nIn order to determine if a property is in open country, the Loan Originator should review \nrecent  maps,  aerial  photographs, and/or conduct a site visit.  In particular,  the Loan  Originator \nshould look for significant new development in parts of rural areas that adjoin non- rural \nareas and  investigate the likelihood that local authorities may re -designate the area’s \ncorporate limits.  \n2.Assessing  “Population”\nIn order  to find the population figures  for a locality,  the Loan  Originator should use\nthe decennial U.S. Census of Population, or population updates published by the U.S. Bureau of the Census. In calculating population figures for a locality, any incarcerated prison population must be excluded from the total area population. \n3.Assessing  “Serious  Lack  of Mortgage Credit”\nThis determination  is made jointly  by the Secretary  of Agriculture and the\nSecretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). \n4.Assessing  “Rural in Character”\nA ru\nral in character  (RIC)  analysis  must be completed  for areas  meeting  “Special\nConsiderations” as outlined in Paragraph 5.3 B. 1. and 2 of this Handbook. \nHowever,  an area is automatically  considered  to be RIC when  the population density is \nless than or equal to 1,000 persons per square mile. When the population density is greater \nthan 1,000 persons per square mile,  a RIC analysis  must be completed.  When  conducting a \nRIC analysis, the State Director should also account for other factors affecting population density that include, but are not limited to the following: \n•Economic Vitality: The local  economy may be adversely  affected  by industry\nor market conditions such as high unemployment, recent loss of a largeemployer, or similar factors. If so, the area may be currently or imminentlysubject to out- migration that affects the RIC analysis.\n5-5 \n(01-2 3-03) SPECIAL  PN  \nRevised (05-05-25) PN 640"

However, the college \npopulation may be considered when determining the population density as part of the RIC determination. However, only the portion of the college population living on campus may be excluded from population density calculations.  \nB. Special Considerations  \n \n1. Exception  for Rural  Areas  Designated  Prior to October 1990  \n \nIf an area was classified  as rural  prior to October  1, 1990, even  if it is within  an MSA,  it \nmay be still considered rural as long as it: (1) has  a population between 10,000 and 35,000, \n(2) is rural  in character,  and (3) has a serious  lack of mortgage  credit.  This designation can \nremain effective through receipt of census data for the year 2030. Or; \n \n2. Exception  for Rural  Areas  Designated  Between  January 1, 2000, \nand December 31, 2020. \nIf an area was classified as rural or deemed eligible any time between January 1, 2000 , \nand December  31, 2020, even  if it is within  an MSA,  it may be still considered  rural  as long \nas it: (1) has a population between 10,000 and 35,000, (2) is rural in character and  \n(3) has a serious  lack of mortgage  credit.  This designation can remain  effective through \nreceipt of census data for the year  2030.  \n \n3. Contiguous  Areas  \n \nTwo or more towns, villages, cities, or places that are contiguous may be considered \nseparately  for a rural  designation if they are not otherwise  associated  with each other, and \ntheir densely settled areas are not contiguous.  \n \nWhen determining the population count for an area, the Loan Originator also should \nconsider developed areas in contiguous counties or states. In cases involving contiguous counties, the appropriate population figure to be used for the area in question should be determined  after consultation with the State  Director.  In an area involving contiguous  states, \nthe applicable population figure should be determined through an agreement between the two State Directors. The Loan Approval Official  should contact both State  Directors to  help \nmake this determination.  \n \nC. Reviewing  Rural  Area  Designations  \n \nAn area’s  rural designation may be changed as a  result of a periodic review  or after \nthe decennial census of population. Both types of review are discussed below. In all cases,  the local  office  should maintain  a perpetual  master  file to document  all rural  area \ndecisions and include documentation of all public notification actions taken. \n \n5-6"

The Loan  Originator  must  verify  that the requirements  listed  below  are met. \n \n• Size.  There is no specific  limitation  to the size/acreage of the site, provided  it is \nnot large enough to be subdivided under local subdivision regulations.  \n• Income- Producing  Land.  The site must  not have  income -producing land that will be \nused principally for income producing purposes.

These dwellings must otherwise meet the housing needs of the applicant and provide decent, safe, and sanitary living conditions when the improvements financed with the loan are completed. \nInitial Section 502 loans for necessary repairs -only: An initial Section 502 loan can \nbe made to an existing  homeowner for necessary  repairs  provided any existing loan against  the \nproperty is an affordable non-RHS loan. While a whole house inspection is not needed, the dwelling  must otherwise meet  the housing needs  of the applicant  and provide decent,  safe,  and \nsanitary living conditions when the improvements financed with the loan are completed. \nB. New Dwellings  \nAll construction must meet the standards contained in RD Instruction 1924- A. New \ndwellings include homes to be built,  currently  under construction, or those that are less than 12 \nmonths old and never occupied. When applicants enter into a contract to purchase a new dwelling, the Loan Approval Official must consider how the construction quality will be documented. The process for ensuring that the Agency’s construction standards are met is described in Section 6 of this chapter and in Paragraph 6.7. \nC. Survey  Requirements  \nA survey is not required for any financed property unless the title insurance commitment \nspecifically excludes coverage for the property and improvements in the loan policy. The \ncurrently adopted American Land Title Association (ALTA) loan policy (also referred to as \n“extended” or “ALTA extended”) provides explicit extended coverages, including “survey” (or boundary and encroachment) coverage without issuance of a special endorsement. A survey may be required by the title insurance company to remove the exclusions from coverage related to boundaries, encroachments, easements and other matters when issuing an owner’s title policy, but this is not common for the lender’s policy. Although an owner’s policy is not required by the Agency, the borrower may choose to have this coverage  and use loan funds to  pay for it provided \nthe loan does not exceed the appraised value. \n \n5-14"

Flood Hazard  Determination  \nFEMA’s Standard Flood Hazard Determination Form (SFHDF) determines if the home is \nlocated in a Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) and states the availability of flood insurance \nbased on if the community participates in the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). Flood insurance is required when any form of federal financial assistance is intended in whole or in part for acquisition, construction, reconstruction, or substantial improvement of any building located in a SFHA. The flood insurance can  be through NFIP  or under NFIP’s “write your own” program \nwhere the policy is through private insurance that meets the requirements of \n42 \nUSC4012a(b)(1)(A) . Flood insurance must be obtained and maintained throughout the life of the \nloan when any portion of the home is located  in a SFHA,  including attached  garages,  decks and \ncarports,  etc. Flood insurance is not required for any additional structure that is located on the \nproperty but is detached from the home (such as detached shed, garage, or other ancillary structure). Flood insurance is also not required if the financial assistance is less than the \nsubstantial improvement threshold discussed in HB-1-3550, Chapter 7. \nThe information  on the SFHDF will assist  in the preparation  of the environmental review \ndocumentation, which must examine whether there is a reasonable alternative to a proposed \npurchase or construction in a floodplain. The Loan Originator will be responsible for acquiring the SFHDF  from  CoreLogic Flood Services  at: https://www.floodcert.com\n/. CoreLogic provides \n“Life of Loan Determination” in which the Agency will be notified should the site’s floodplain designation change. The SFHDF must be acquired prior to the completion of the environmental review.  \nIf the dwelling is located within a SFHA, the lowest floor (including basements) must be \nelevated  above the base flood elevation  (BFE).  Proof that this requirement  has been  met is usually \nin the form of a FEMA Elevation Certificate, however other forms of documentation may be accepted (see RD Instruction 1970- F). \n \n \n  \n \n    \n \n  \n \n5-20"

If the dwelling  does not \nuse public utilities, the domestic well must be a minimum of 50 feet from the septic drain field (or \nmore, depending on local or state codes). For minor repairs, these requirements are not applicable \nif the dwelling existed prior to the publication of the first FEMA flood map for that location. In \naccordance with RD Instruction 1970- F, section 1970.256 (b) and 1970.261(b), if the property is \nwithin a floodplain, the Agency approval official is  responsible for notifying the applicant about \nthe hazards  associated  with occupancy  of locations  within  a floodplain at the earliest  possible  point \nin the Agency’s decision- making process. A template notice can be found in RD Instruction 1970-  \nF, Exhibit B, Attachment 2. \n \nC. Responsibility  for Environmental  Reviews  \nThe Loan  Originator  is responsible  for ensuring that the appropriate  level  of environmental  review  has \nbeen completed prior to the commitment of federal funds. This includes the assembly and analysis of \nrelevant material, the development and analysis of practical alternatives and mitigation measures (as appropriate), and the development of recommendations regarding environmental impacts and environmental compliance. Applicants may be requested to provide information needed for the analysis.  \nPrior to the appraisal, the Agency will begin the appropriate level of environmental \nreview using submitted documents and available online resources. If the appraiser marked “No” \nto the question, “Are there any adverse site conditions or external factors ( easements, \nencroachments,  environmental  conditions, land uses,  etc.)?” under  the site portion of the Uniform \nResidential Appraisal Report, then the Field Office is not required to conduct a site inspection in order  to complete  the environment  review.  Howev er, if the appraiser  answers  in the affirmative,  a \nqualified Rural Development official must conduct a site inspection to determine if the initial \nenvironmental review decision is accurate based on observations of Agency staff during the site visit.  \nThe Loan Approval Official will use the environmental review documents and, as \nappropriate, the recommendations of the State Environmental Coordinator (SEC), to make the Agency’s final decision regarding an environmental impact determination and compliance  with \nenvironmental  requirements, as well as flood insurance  requirements.  For Categorical  Exclusions \nwithout an ER, this decision is evidenced by the completion of RD Instruction 1970-  B, Exhibit \nD, which will be signed by the form’s preparer and the Loan Approval Official (if these are the same person, both applicable signatory lines should be signed). For Categorical Exclusions with an ER, the SEC must  review  the environmental  documentation and sign the Exhibit  D in addition \nto the preparer and Loan Approval Official. The Agency’s decision for EAs is documented by the signing of the Finding of No Significant Impact (FONSI) by the Loan Approval Official; \nafter reviewing the EA, the SEC will assist with the FONSI’s preparation.  \nSECs  are available to provide  technical  assistance and  guidance.

The information should be made available to the applicant, who may not be \naware of the problem. The applicant, once informed, may wish to look for a different site or to \nconsider some method of noise reduction.

This section provides guidance about the types of appraisals that may be needed, when \nappraisals are required, how they are ordered, and how they must be reviewed. \n5.14 REQUIREMENTS  FOR  APPRAISALS  \nAppraisals  must meet  the following requirements:  \n•Qualified Appraiser : In nearly all cases, Direct Single Family Housing appraisal\nassignments will be completed  by a state–certified  or licensed  appraiser  using nationwide\ncontracts with Appraisal Management Companies (AMCs). Contract appraisers must becertified or licensed (or hold a “Temporary Practice Permit” issued by the respectivestate for a specific period of time and for a specific property), in the state in which thesubject property is located. When using a contract appraiser, the Agency will contractwith qualified appraisers that are active on the Appraisal Subcommittee website(www.asc.gov) . However, w\n hen a contract  appraiser  is not available at an acceptable cost\nor is unable to complete an appraisal timely, a qualified Agency appraiser may conductthe appraisal. For credit transactions that are $100,000 or greater, Agency appraiser mustpossess the same qualifications as those required for contract appraisers , except that an\nAgency appraiser is only required to be certified in one state or territory to perform realproperty appraisal duties as a Federal employee in all states and territories.\n•Standards :\n  All appraisals  must be consistent with the current  edition  of the Uniform\nStandards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) available at\nwww.appraisalfoundation.org and comply with Agency appraisal requirements, as\ndescribed in this chapter and in 7 CFR3550.62(a).\n•Timelines :  In general, appraisals are ordered under the nationwide contracts with\nAppraisal  Management  Companies (AMCs)  and are generally  completed  within  15\nbusiness days. In-house appraisals are to be completed within 7 calendar days of\nreceiving the appraisal order.\n•Nondiscrimination : The appraiser  may not use factors  that are discriminatory  on the\nbasis of race, color, religion, sex, disability, familial status, or national origin inconducting the appraisal and valuing the property.\n•Use of a Third Party Appraisal : The Agency may only use an appraisal for which it did\nnot contract for when the appraisal was obtained from a leveraged lender involved in thetransaction  and that lender is financing  at least 20 percent  of the transaction  with loan funds\nor 15 percent if entirely a grant, forgivable loan or deferred loan except when the lender isalso a party  to the transaction such as seller, builder, developer, or contractor.\n5-27\n(01-23-03 ) SPECIAL PN          \nRevised (0 5-05-25) PN 640"

    "content": "HB-1-3550  \nParagraph 5.14 Requirements for Appraisals  \n \nThe Agency  reviewer  should be especially  diligent  in reviewing  these appraisals  to ensure \nthey meet USPAP and Agency appraisal requirements and the expected intended use is \nthe same as the intended use reported in the appraisal. The Agency is not required to use any appraisal that it did not contract for directly.  \n5.15 TYPES  OF VALUES  \nDepending on the type and purpose  of the appraisal  needed,  an appraiser  will be asked  to \nprovide an estimated value of the property based on one of the following:  \n• As Is. For existing dwellings that require no repairs/alterations or require \nrepairs/alterations that typically add no value (e.g., general maintenance to the home’s infrastructure  and machinery);  newly  constructed  dwellings;  and to support  \na loan servicing action or to determine a disposition plan for a  REO  property. \n• Cost  Approach  Only.  See Paragraph  5.16 for a description.  \n• Subject  to Completion  of Plans  & Specs.  For newly  constructed  dwellings  to be built.  \n• Subject  to Repairs/Alterations.  For existing  dwellings  that require  repairs/alterations \nthat typically add value  (e.g., window  replacement, siding  replacement, and bathroom \nremodel).  \n \n5.16 APPRAISAL  METHODOLOGY  \nReal estate appraisers  make  judgments  about  a property’s  value  based  on many  factors, \nincluding location, market conditions, construction quality, and amenities. Single Family Housing Appraisals require one, two, or three approaches to value, as described below, depending on the specific assignment. \n• Sales  comparison  approach.  Under  this method, the appraiser  uses the recent  sales  data of \nproperties that are comparable in location and characteristics to the security property in \norder to estimate a market value for the  property. \n \n• Cost approach. Under this method, the appraiser derives an estimate of value using \nreplacement  cost estimates  for the improvements,  less depreciation  and an estimate  of the \nsite value. If applicable, the appraiser will identify the source of cost estimates, such as \nMarshall and Swift, used in the cost approach.  \n \nThe methodology used to estimate  depreciation,  and an analysis  may be stated  in the \nreport. This method is required for a dwelling to be constructed, or a  dwelling that is less  \nthan one year old. The remaining economic life ( see ‘useful life ’ in Paragraph  6.8 of this \nHandbook) must be stated for all properties.  \n• Income Approach . Under this method the appraiser derives a value indication for an \nincome -producing property by converting its anticipated benefits (cash flows and \nreversion)  into property  value.  This conversion can be accomplished  in two ways,  direct \ncapitalization or yield capitalization. This method may only be used for Agency non-  \nprogram REO properties.  \n \n5-28"

(Another lender’s  appraisal  is acceptable \nwhen the loan is part of a leveraging strategy under certain circumstances as described in Chapter  \n10.) If the total indebtedness against the property is less than or equal to $15,000, an appraisal is not required if the Loan Originator is confident that the property has sufficient value to serve as adequate  security.  For Section 504 total indebtedness requirements, see Par agraph 12.6 B of this \nHandbook. Total  indebtedness includes Agency loans plus any prior liens  on the property. The \nLoan  Originator should include a statement of the property’s value in the case file whenever an \nappraisal is not complet ed. \nFor subsequent loans, no appraisal is required if the loan is less than $7,500 and is for \nminimal essential repairs needed to ensure that the dwelling is decent, safe, and sanitary. An appraisal  is not required  when  a subsequent loan is made to protect  the Government’s interest, \nregardless of the amount. The Loan Originator must include a statement of the estimated property value in the case file. If the subsequent loan is for $7,500 or more, no appraisal is needed unless the property will be taken as security and at least 1 of the following conditions exists:  \n•The latest  appraisal  report of the real estate is over 2 years  old;\n•The physical characteristics  of the property have changed  significantly;\n•The economic characteristics  of the market  have changed  significantly;\n•The Loan  Originator is uncertain  of the adequacy  of the security; or\n•The subsequent loan is in connection with a transfer  of an  existing  loan.\nB.Program Responsibilities\nIn accordance with RD Instruction 2024-A, contract services shall not involve decision \nmaking or other inherently governmental functions. Accordingly, prior to ordering an appraisal  on \nthe subject property, the Field Office will ensure that the property is located in an eligible area (which should be accomplished by entering the property’s address in the Agency’s property eligibility website); and review the sales contract and related  materials (such as the property’s \nMultiple Listing Service sheet, tax bills,  etc.) to confirm that the dwelling and/or site appear to \ncomply with the Agency’s regulations and guidance. \n5-29 \n(01-23-03 ) SPECIAL PN \nRevised (05-05-25) PN 640"

This list of repairs, which is based upon the inspection reports prepared by State-licensed inspectors or qualified, third party inspectors hired by the applicant (refer to Paragraph 5.7 A of this Chapter.), will be provided to the appraiser for the purpose of obtaining a subject to repairs/alterations value provided those repairs/alterations typically add value and are not routine maintenance items (e.g. check smoke detectors, pest or septic inspection, add GFCI protection to exterior, kitchen, or bathroom electrical outlets, etc.). \nC. Required  Information  \nWhen the Loan Originator or Staff Appraiser requests an appraisal through the PMO’s \nProcurement  Requests  SharePoint site\n using the current  SFH Appraisal  Request form  (which  can \nbe found in the Direct Training Hub in SharePoint  along with other appraisal training materials), \nthe following information will be uploaded (as applicable): Cost Breakdown, Legal Description/Deed, Plan & Specs (New Construction), Plat of Property, Prior Appraisal (1004D only), Property Inspection Report, Proposed Repairs – Est. Cost $, Purchase Agreement & Amendments, and Survey (if available). \nThe applicant has until the expiration of their Certificate of Eligibility, as described in \nParagraph  4.25 of this Handbook, to present  this information  to the Loan  Originator. Originals  of \nthis information should be kept in the case file, with copies provided to the appraiser. \nD. Appraisal  Disputes  (Reconsideration of Value Requests ) \nIn situations where the market value of the security is inadequate to support the loan \nrequest, the Loan Originator will send Handbook Letter 17 (3550), Adverse Decision Involving an Appraisal. Handbook Letter 17 of this Handbook informs the applicant of their right to dispute the appraisal report (i.e. reconsideration of value—ROV) .  The request must be initiated by the \napplicant;  however, they  may seek assistance from their real estate agent, builder, or other third \nparties .  Requests for an ROV or other dispute of the appraisal from parties other than the applicant \nwill not be considered by the Agency.  Applicants should include support for their request by: \n1. Present ing any new, objective information regarding the subject property, for the \nAgency’s consideration (e.g. incorrect or incomplete information was used for square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, garage size, upgrades, repaired or renovated conditions, etc.), and/or \n2. Submitting additional market sales data for consideration.  No more than 5 additional market sales may be presented for consideration by the appraiser as part of a request for reconsideration of value. Sales provided must have been sold prior \nto the effective date of the appraisal, be very similar to the subject property (e.g. \nstyle, square footage, age, etc.) and from the same or highly similar market area.   \n                                                                         5- 30"

When the applicant’s response is related to item 2 (above) the Loan Approval \nOfficial will initiate a reconsideration of value request by sending an email with related  \nattachments to  the nationwide appraisal services administration team at: rd.appraisals@usda.gov \nwho will coordinate the requests with the contractors and/or Appraisal Management Companies \n(AMCs).   \nIf the RD staff ap praiser’s  technical  review  concurs with the original appraisal,  or if after \nrevisions are coordinated and the market value still does not support the loan amount, then the Loan Originator will send the applicant Handbook Letter 18 (3550) of this Handbook, Unfavorable Decision after Technical Review of an Appraisal, with appeal rights (Attachment 1 -B of this Handbook). The appeal will consider the Agency’s underwriting \ndecision regarding inadequate security (market value) to support the loan request. Once an appraisal has been accepted by the Agency the market value reported within the appraisal is not appealable.  \n5.18     APPRAISER RESPONSIBILITIES  \nThe appraiser must provide the required estimates of value on the appropriate form. The \nappraiser  may also be asked  to provide a list of repairs  deemed  essential  for the property to be made \ndecent, safe, and sanitary.  \nIf an appraiser observes potential contamination from hazardous substances, hazardous \nwastes, or petroleum products on the property, or obtains other information about such contamination, that information  should be provided to the Agency  together  with an indication  of \nits potential impact on the value of the property. The Loan Originator must initiate the due diligence process by completing Attachment 5-B of this Chapter . The completed Attachment 5 -\nB of this Chapter must be sent promptly to the SEC for further evaluation and guidance. \n5.19 REVIEWING  APPRAISALS  \nAppraisals  will be  reviewed through a combination of administrative  reviews and technical \nreviews.  Administrative  reviews  can be completed  by Agency  staff trained  to do so while  technical \nreviews must be completed by certified Agency appraisers. A technical  review  for loan origination \nis an inherently governmental function and must be completed by an Agency appraiser.

Administrative  Review  \nAdministrative reviews are performed by the Loan Approval Official using Form RD \n1922- 15, Administrative  Appraisal  Review  for Single Family  Housing, and should be completed  \nas soon as possible (but not later than 7 business days  from  receipt  of the appraisal).  Reviews  are \nperformed on all contract appraisals and the contract appraiser’s invoice cannot be paid until the \nappraisal review is complete. This review determines if there are inconsistencies in the appraisal report that warrant a secondary review of the property and the sales contract prior to loan approval, or if a technical review  should be conducted  by the staff appraiser  prior to paying the \nappraiser’s  invoice. \nIndicators that a technical  review  may be required  consist of the following: (1) Photos and \nmaps are not consistent with the information provided in the appraisal; (2) Large variances in actual and effective age are not supported; (3) Comparables are located outside of the subject’s market area or they are superior/inferior to the subject warranting excessive adjustments that are not supported; (4) Sales and Financing concessions are not reported or comparables are not properly adjusted when they are reported; (5) History of the subject property was omitted or not analyzed; and (6) Inconsistent information in the appraisal. \n \nIf the appraisal  is acceptable,  Field  Staff  must promptly forward  (within  7 days) the email \nreceived from the appraiser or AMC to rd.appraisals@usda.gov  with “Appraisal Reviewed & \nAccepted” in the subject line. If the appraisal is not acceptable, Field Staff must forward the appraisal and Form RD 1922-15 to the Agency’s Regional Appraisal Services for a technical review. The request for the technical revi ew must be through the \nRegional Appraisal Services  \nSharePoint site . \nB. Technical  Review  \nA technical review can be either a field review or a desk review and is performed to \ndetermine whether the appraisal is credible within the intended use, was clearly reasoned, \nfollowed accepted  appraisal  techniques and RD requirements and had adequate support for the \nconclusion of value. Technical reviews are an inherently governmental function and must be performed  by Agency  certified  appraisers.  Technical  reviews  completed  by Agency  appraisers \nshould be consistent with current USPAP requirements which can be found at www.appraisalfoundation.org.\n \nField reviews involve on-site visits to the subject property and the comparables, while desk \nreviews are performed in the office. Technical reviews must be completed for the first appraisal conducted by any contract appraiser and for each appraiser that does multiple appraisals in a 12- month period. Additionally, each contract apprais er must be reviewed at least once in a three- year \nperiod. At the discretion of the Regional Appraisal Staff, additional technical reviews may be ordered  if concerns were  encountered  on the first technical  review.  In addition to the initial review, \ntechnical desk or field reviews will be done in a random, spot- check  method established by the State \nDirector for contract appraisals but should be completed on a minimum of 5 percent of the contract appraisals received.  \n A technical  review  also may be requested  by the Loan  Approval Official  when  concerns are detected \nby the administrative review. The concerns will be documented on Form RD 1922-15. The Regional Appraisal  Staff  must determine  if the concerns merit a technical  review  before the \nvendor’s invoice can be paid or the loan closed. \n5-32"

The UL will generally  be \nposted 30 days prior to the effective date of the fee change. Within 3 business days of receiving a \ncompleted application, the Loan Originator will provide the applicant with CFPB’s standard Loan \nEstimate, which includes the amount of the appraisal fee listed in the current UL. \nThe Agency  may  waive  the fee  for appraisals  done for subsequent loans needed  to make \nminimal,  essential  repairs  necessary  to protect  the Government’s interest,  or for leveraged  loans \nif a participating lender is obtaining an appraisal that is acceptable to the Agency. \nIf there is a conditional commitment,  the appraisal  fee should be paid to the contractor  at \nclosing as reimbursement for the cost of the appraisal that was included in the conditional \ncommitment fee.  \n \n5.21      APPRAISALS  IN REMOTE RURAL  AREAS,  ON TRIBAL  LANDS,  OR \nWHERE THERE IS A LACK OF CONVENTIONAL MARKET  ACTIVITY \n \nIn remote  rural  areas,  on Tribal  lands, or areas  with a lack of conventional lending market \nactivity it may be difficult to obtain adequate comparable sales to appraise a property. In these areas, the sales comparison approach is not required. Instead, Form 1007, Marshall and Swift Square Foot Appraisal Form must be used. These appraisals may be conducted by Agency staff appraisers or by contract appraisers.  \nRemote  rural  areas  are identified  by the State  Director  and are defined  as areas  with these \ntypes of characteristics:  \n• Scattered  population;  \n• Low density of residences;  \n• Lack  of basic shopping facilities; \n• Lack  of community  and public services  and facilities; and \n• Lack  of comparable sales  data.  \nThe results  of the cost analysis  completed  using Form  1007 should be documented  on the \nUniform Residential Appraisal Report and efforts to obtain comparable market data must be \ndocumented in lieu of the sales comparison approach. External depreciation based on the \nremoteness of the site must not be considered; however, factors that impac t the site such as \nimmediate proximity to a feedlot, factory, or other similar considerations should be included. \nWhen  a market  is established  in these areas,  the Agency  will again  require complete  appraisals.  \n \n \n (01-23-03) SPECIAL  PN \nRevised  (12-08-22) PN 572 \n \n 5-33"

Typically, this work will involve a general contractor who is responsible for supervising and directly paying their subcontractors. Work described in this section is more complex and would commonly take more than 30 days to complete.  \nWhen  applicants  enter  into contracts  with builders  who own the site and are self-funding \nthe construction process, the Loan Originator will enter the dwelling type in LoanServ as \n“Purchase New” rather than “Build”. The Loan Approval Official should communicate with the \napplicant and builder on how acceptable construction quality w ill be documented in accordance \nwith Paragraph 6.7 B. and the standards in RD Instruction 1924- A. \n5.22     DESIGN  \nA.  Disseminating  the Standards  \nThe applicant  needs  to know  the standards  the dwelling  must  meet  before  the design process \nbegins. The Loan Originator should advise the applicant of the Agency’s rehabilitation or construction standards.  \nThe applicant  and/or  designer  should also be provided with Form  RD 1924- 2, Description  of \nMaterials, prior to loan approval. This form may be used by the designer as a basis for preparing specifications. When other suitable specifications are available which will adequately describe the materials, equipment, and fixtures to be used on the job, this form need not be  used.  \nB. Review  and Approve  the Drawings  and Specifications  \nOnce the drawings and specifications are finished, the Loan Originator should review them \nto ensure  that they have  been  certified  as meeting  the Agency’s  minimum standards  contained  in RD \nInstruction 1924- A. The plans, specifications, calculations, and any modifications should be  \ncertified by the design professional on Form RD 1924- 25, Plan Certification, to ensure that the \nappropriate codes and standards are met. If all applicable requirements are met, the Loan Originator may accept the documents. If they do not meet the applic able requirements, the Loan Originator \nshould inform the applicant and designer, in writing, of the deficiencies or discrepancies. Once \nthese issues are resolved, the Loan Originator should review the drawings and specifications  again.  \n5.23    PREPARING  FOR  CONSTRUCTION  \nA. Selecting  the Contractor  \nThe applicant should select the contractor who will build or rehabilitate the dwelling. The \ncontractor  must  have  a valid  state contractor’s  license  if required  in the state,  and such license must \nbe documented by the Loan Originator.

Bids should be solicited based on the developed set of specifications. Detailed specifications must include a complete breakdown on materials and labor and describe the quantity, quality, grades, styles, model numbers, etc. \nThe development budget may include an amount for contingencies not to exceed five \npercent  of the construction cost for unusual and unforeseen circumstances  beyond the contractor’s \nor borrower’s control (e.g. a major disaster in the region that causes an increase in materials and subcontracted labor costs). The contractor and borrower must submit a signed change order to the Loan Approval Official for concurrence to use the contingency funds. Contingency funds may also be used for other eligible loan purposes when approved by the Loan Approval Official.

The parties should review the drawings and specifications to make sure everyone \nunderstands the scope of work, construction/thermal standards, environmental mitigation \nrequirements, materials, inspection,  change orders, and payment procedures. In addition, the \ncontractor must be advised that should human remains, historical or cultural resources be uncovered during excavation or site development, all work must be stopped until an additional environmental analysis is completed.  \nFor new construction or rehabilitation,  the Loan  Originator should provide Exhibits F and \nG of RD Instruction 1924-A to the contractor at or before the pre- construction conference.

Agency  inspections are to protect  the \nAgency’s interest and to ensure the \ncompletion of construction or rehabilitation without implication of duty or obligation to the borrower.  The final  inspection can be conducted by the Loan  Approval Official/Originator,  or by a \nqualified third party. Inspections fees from third parties, like building permits, are eligible loan purposes. The inspector must be qualified to perform a construction inspection. A qualified third party includes, a local building official, an inspector certified by a nationally recognized home inspection entity, or a state -licensed  inspector who inspects property according to the International \nCode Council (ICC). The ICC publishes the International Building Codes used by most of the jurisdictions  within  the United  States.  An appraiser  may perform  a completion valuation inspection, \nbut this report is not sufficient for the Agency’s purpose without other supporting documentation such as a certificate of occupancy, or a final inspection from a local building official or other qualified third party. \nA qualified  third  party  inspector should be able to execute  each of the following, as \napplicable:  \n•Inspecting  for conformity  with development plans  and building codes,  with written\nreports, at footing, framing, and final project phases.\n•Preparation  of additional inspection reports  to include an analysis  of the project’s\nprogress and quality of workmanship. Reports may include notes fromteleconferences, inspection reports, video and/or photos.\n•Issue  specific and critical  activity  reports,  video or photos of apparent  errors  or\nproblems with workmanship.\n•Document and evaluate any expressed  opinion, fact, and observation by the owner,\nthird party inspector, or building/code official.\n•Document discussions with the owner, inspector(s) and contractor.\nB.Periodic Inspections\nIf inspections are conducted by a third party, the inspector should submit periodic inspection\nreports to the Agency. The number and timing of inspections varies by the type and extent of work \nperformed. When concerns are raised by the inspector, contractor, borrower, or Agency staff, clear communication between the parties is critical to  successful completion of the work. \n5-37\n(01-23-03 ) SPECIAL PN \nRevised (05-05-25) PN 640  Borrower’s  Responsibility \nfor Inspection  \nThe borrower is responsible for making \ninspections to protect his or her interest.

    "content": "HB-1-3550  \nParagraph  5.24 Construction  Period  \n• New  construction.  Inspections  may be conducted as  necessary,  but a minimum of 3 \ngenerally are required: (1) footings while under construction; (2) after the dwelling \nis framed -in; and (3) a final inspection once all work is  complete.  \n• Substantial  rehabilitation. A  new  addition, remodeling, moving walls, changing the \nfoundation, or structural integrity of the home are examples of substantial rehabilitation. It is more complex than simple repairs and oftentimes affects multiple major components of the dwelling. This type of work generally requires permits a nd \ninspections by the local building department. All rehabilitation work must be inspected, but the Agency does not prescribe specific guidelines for inspecting rehabilitation work that does not involve new construction. A qualified third- party \ninspector may be used and should inspect at intervals that are appropriate for the complexity  of the work. The Loan  Originator  may also rely on current  media  (photos, \nvideo) and third -party  inspection reports, which are quickly and easily transmitted,  to \nrender an effective remote assessment for compliance determinations.  \n• Final  Inspection:  The following  documents  should be submitted  prior to final \npayment and the Loan Originator should address the acceptability of the documentation and the completed repairs in the  running record:  \n◊ The forms  listed  in Paragraph  5.25  of this Chapter . \n◊ Borrower’s  written  acceptance of the completed  work.  \n◊ Photos  of the completed  work  as provided by the borrower  and/or  contractor.  \n◊ A copy of a third -party  inspection (if applicable).  \n• Environmental requirements. If environmental mitigation measures are required, \nthe Agency’s  inspector  should follow  up on the implementation  of such measures  and \ndocument compliance on Form RD 1924- 12. Noncompliance with environmental \nmitigation measures must be reported promptly to the Loan Originator and the  SEC.  \nC.  Partial  Payments  \nPartial  payments  for work  completed can  be issued  after each inspection. The contractor and \nLoan Originator establish a draw schedule before loan closing. This schedule identifies when \npartial payments  may  be made,  based  on the amount  of work  completed.  The amount  of the \npayment  is typically based on the value of the work, according to Exhibit A of RD Instruction \n1924- A, or the Marshall and Swift guidelines. To ensure that all work will be satisfactorily \ncompleted, 40 percent (or a lesser percent if required by state law) of each pay ment request is \ntypically withheld until all of the work items established in the  draw schedule are complet e \nand final payment is made, as described in Paragraph 5.25 of this Chapter . The amount \nwithheld can be reduced to 10 percent if the contractor obtains a Surety Bond, Performance Bond, or Payment Bond, but this is extremely rare.  \n \n \n5-38"

A warranty is a guarantee of the quality of work or materials. \nThe Agency must have a copy of 1 of the 2 acceptable forms of builder’s warranties \nas listed below (the applicant keeps the original).  \n◊ Form RD 1924-19, Builder’s Warranty is a 1-year warranty provided to the \nborrower by the contractor after the construction work has been accepted by the \nborrower and the Agency. A builder’s warranty is issued for new construction (or rehabilitation  involving construction) that has had appropriate periodic inspections \nconducted by the Agency  (or third  party).  The warranty  guarantees  that the builder \nwill repair or replace any defects in materials or construction that occur within 1 \nyear from the date of acceptance. The Servicing and Asset Management Office \n(Servicing Office) will be responsible for notifying the borrower of the expiration of the builder’s warranty within eleven months of acceptance of the final inspection. \n \n◊ An insured 10-year warranty is purchased by the builder and insures the \nborrower against  builder defaults  and/or major  structural  defects.  This policy is \ntypically used when the borrower is purchasing an existing or newly constructed dwelling and the Agency does not have acceptable documentation of construction quality. If construction quality is not adequately documented, loans for new dwellings are limited to 90 percent of the market value plus allowable excess costs (see Paragraph 6.7\n of this Handbook ). \n \nHowever, a builder may provide an insured 10- year warranty as acceptable \ndocumentation of construction quality  so that the Agency  may loan 100 percent \nof the market value plus allowable costs, provided the policy is non- refundable \nor cancellable,  the policy is from  an insurance company  licensed  to do business \nin the state where the property is located, and the coverage includes (from effective date) at least one year for any defects caused by faulty workmanship or defective materials, two years coverage on major systems (e.g., electrical, plumbing, HVA C), and ten year structural defect coverage.  \n \n• Other documentation.  The Agency  should maintain  the following documentation, \nif applicable:  \n \n◊ Certificate  of Occupancy  (in some localities,  a certificate of occupancy from \nthe local authority is required before a new or renovated structure may be occupied);  \n \n◊ Copies of building permits; \n◊ Form  RD 1924-25, Plan Certification;  \n \n \n \n5-40"

Loan Origination  Appraisal - The majority of appraisals prepared  for USDA RD will \nbe of single family homes under the value definition and processes described in \nSections 1 and 2 above. In certain instances , appraisals may be of properties that are: \nconstructed or located within a Community Land Trust, properties located on leased land, properties affected by deed restrictions, or properties constructed und er RD’s \nSection 523 Mutual Self-Help Housing Program. \n \nThe Mu tual Self -Help Program utilizes supervised labor performed by borrowers as \npart of the construction process. Construction is supervised by technical experts to assure the quality of its completion . Appraisal s of these properties should consider \nconstruction, materials, and finish will be completed in a professional and workmanlike manner. \nSpecific guidance should be requested from RD, or the contracting Appraisal \nManagement Company, for properties affected by these conditions as they have unique \nrequirements necessary to produce an acceptable appraisal report.  \n \nB. Loan Servicing Appraisal  - In the event the appraiser is requested to complete an \nappraisal for a servicing action such as foreclosure, short sale, deed- in-lieu, etc., an \nappraisal  reflecting  the market  value of the property  in its “as-is” condition is necessary \nfor RD  use. \n \nAdditionally, the appraiser shall provide under the same cover within the addenda, a liquidation  value estimate  for the subject  property, as defined  in Item 2, considering a \nprescribed marketing period of 30 days. Liquidation value should be defined, and the methodology utilized to determine value under this definition must be reported. \n \nTypically, when  a property in foreclosure  is occupied,  the appraiser  will not be required  to \ngain access for a visual inspection of the interior of the subject property. In this case, the appraiser must complete the appraisal report on the Fannie Mae Form 2055/Freddie Mac Form 2055, “Exterior -Only Inspection Residential Appraisal Report” unless specifically \ninstructed otherwise by RD. Because there was not an interior inspection, the report must include an extraordinary assumption regarding the interior components, assumed condition and  the sources  being used as the basis for the assumption should be cited: \nhttps://www.rd.usda.gov/files/3550-1chapter13.pdf\n (Handbook-1-3550, Chapter 13 \n(13.17) (C) (3)."

The appraiser must use at a minimumthree (3) comparable closed sales of single family residential proper ties that sold in the\nprevious 12 month period unless the appraiser provides documentation that suchcomparable transactions are not available in the area. Comparable sales s hould be located\nas close as possible to the subject dwelling, from within the competitive market area, andshould be the most comparable available for purposes of valuation.\nB.Cost Approach: This method is specified  in Handbook 1-3550, Chapter  5, found at this\nweb address, http://www.rd.usda.gov/files/3550-1chapter05.pdf . For all proposed\nconstruction or all homes having an age of one year or less, RD requires that theappraiser develop, report and reconcile the cost approach to value. On homes over oneyear of age, the appraiser should determine whether the cost approach is relevant ornecessary to determine a valid opinion of market value. This determination must bedeveloped and reported in accordance with the USPAP.\nUnder this method, the appraiser  derives an estimate  of value using replacement  cost\nestimates for the improvements, less depreciation of all forms, and then adding an\nestimate of the site value.\n(01-23-03 ) SPECIAL PN \nRevised (0 5-05-25) PN 640"

The methodology used to estimate \ndepreciation must be stated in the report. \n \nProperties  in remote  rural  areas,  on tribal lands (American  Native  and Alaskan  Native),  areas \nwith a lack of market activity, or those representing a leasehold interest, where it may be \ndifficult to obtain adequate comparable sales to be used for comparative purposes in order to appraise a property. In these areas, the sales comparison approach is not required. Instead, Marshall & Swift Form 1007, Square Foot Appraisal Form, must be used. \n \nRemote  rural  areas  are identified  by RD and are defined as areas  lacking  sufficient \nmarket activity and having the following characteristics:  \n• Scattered  population;  \n• Low density of residences ; \n• Lack of basic shopping facilities;  \n• Lack of community and public services and facilities ; \n• Lack of comparable sales data  \n \n \nC. Income Approach : Under this method, the appraiser derives a value indication for an \nincome-producing property by converting its anticipated benefits (cash flows and reversion) into property value. This conversion can be accomplished in two ways. One year’s  income expectancy  can be capitalized  at a market -derived capitalization  rate or at a \ncapitalization rate that reflects a specified income pattern, return on investment, and change in  the value of  the investment.  Alternatively, the annual cash flows for the \nholding period and the reversion can be discounted at a specified yield rate. \nThe Income Approach method of valuation may only be used for Agency Non - \nProgram Properties such as Real Estate Owned (REO) or Non -Program Loan \nAssumptions.  \n \nUSPAP Standards Rule 2- 2 (a) (viii) require the appraisal report to summarize the \ninformation  analyzed,  the appraisal  methods and techniques employed, and reasoning \nthat supports the analyses, opinions, and conclusions; and also, exclusion  of the sales \ncomparison approach, cost approach, or income approach must be explained."

The appraiser  may use either  site-built housing or a different  type of factory -built housing \nas the third comparable sale if the appraiser explains the reason for selecting the comparable and support the appropriate adjustments in the appraisal report . \n \nG. All extraordinary assumptions, hypothetical conditions, and limiting conditions must be \nclearly and prominently described in a single location near the beginning of the report and in appropriate sections  of the appraisal.

By putting all of this \ninformation together, the Loan Originator can determine the applicant’s repayment ability, \nwhether a loan can be approved, and the amount of the loan. This chapter is structured as follows:  \n \n• Section  1 reviews  the concept  of underwriting;  \n• Section  2 describes  loan  terms and  requirements;  \n• Section  3 provides  policies  and procedures  for determining whether  the applicant  is \neligible for payment subsidy and the amount of the subsidy;  and \n• Section  4 provides  policies  and procedures  for underwriting a loan for a specific \nproperty and preparing the loan approval  recommendation. \n \n6.2 WHAT  IS UNDERWRITING?  \n \nThrough the underwriting process, the Loan Originator evaluates an applicant’s \ncircumstances and the condition and value of the property to determine whether making a particular  loan is a prudent  use of funds. Exhibit  6-1 of this Chapter  summarizes  key \nunderwriting decisions.  \n \nUnderwriting has both objective and subjective elements. For example, \nincome  eligibility  is an objective  factor  -- if the applicant’s  income  exceeds  program \nincome limits, the applicant cannot receive a program loan. On the other hand, analyzing an applicant’s credit history and estimating the value of the property both involve  some  degree of judgment. The underwriter’s  challenge is to make both objective  and \nsubjective decisions in a fair and impartial manner for all applicants.  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n6-1 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL  PN \nRevised  (11-06-24) PN 628  \n \n \nCHAPTER  6: UNDERWRITING  THE LOAN"

However, because the Agency’s mission, in part, is to serve home \nbuyers  who are unable  to obtain private  credit,  the underwriting process  differs  in 4 key respects:  \n \n• The Agency’s  criteria for an acceptable credit  history are somewhat  less stringent \nthan those used by private lenders;  \n \n• Agency  loan-to-value  requirements  enable many  applicants  to become homeowners \nwith little or no down payment;  \n \n• In most  circumstances,  the Agency  has the ability  to offer subsidies  that enhance an \napplicant’s ability to repay the loan;  and \n \n• The Agency conducts quality checks on new loans as well as on withdrawn and \nrejected applications to confirm that the Loan Originator complied with the underwriting standards  and procedures.

Situations  in Which  Refinancing  is Permissible  \nRefinancing  of non-Agency  debt, except  for debt on manufactured  homes, is \npermissible in 3 circumstances.  \n• Refinancing for an existing home at risk of foreclosure. An applicant who \nowns  a home  but is clearly  unable  to continue  making  payments  and risks  losing \nthe home through foreclosure may be eligible for Agency refinancing if the risk is due to circumstances beyond the applicant’s control. Risk of foreclosure doesn’t  necessarily  mean  that the applicant’s  mortgage  is currently  delinquent;  it \nmeans that foreclosure is a highly likely eventuality because the mortgage payments are no longer sustainable due to circumstances beyond the applicant’s control.  \n• Refinancing for an existing home in need of repairs. Debt on an existing home may be refinanced if the home is in need of repairs totaling $5,000 or  \nmore to correct major deficiencies and make the dwelling decent, safe, and sanitary; and refinancing is necessary for the borrower to show repayment ability.  In such cases  the owner  need  not be at risk of losing the property  through \nforeclosure.  \n• Refinancing for a site without a dwelling. Agency funds may be used to refinance non-Agency  debt on a building site without  a dwelling  if the debt is for \nthe sole purpose of purchasing the site, the applicant is unable to pay the debt, and the applicant is otherwise unable to acquire decent, safe, and sanitary housing. The site must meet the conditions described in Section 1 of Chapter 5 of this Handbook. The Agency loan must include adequate funds to construct a \ndwelling on the site that conforms to the requirements of Section 2 of Chapter 5, of this Handbook and the applicant must occupy the property once it is  \nconstructed.  \n    In any of these circumstances,  a non-Agency  loan, including a Single  Family  Housing \nGuaranteed Loan, can be refinanced only if the Agency will have adequate security. For a  site \nwith an existing dwelling, the applicant must engage the services of a State -licensed inspector to \nperform a whole house inspection and provide statement that the dwelling appears to meet the Agency’s DSS standards as described in Section 2 of Chapter  5 of this Handbook. If there are \nany noted deficiencies that prevent the home from meeting decent, safe, and sanitary standards, the deficiencies must be addressed as part of the loan.  \n________________________________________________________________________ \n6-7 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL PN  \nRevised ( 11-06-24) PN 628"

Eligible  Debt  \nIn general,  Agency  funds  can be used to refinance only debt that was incurred  for eligible \npurposes, as described in Paragraph 6.4 of this Chapter. For applicants who are in danger of \nforeclosure,  Agency funds also may be used to repay a protective advance made by a mortgagee \nfor costs related to the delinquency, such as accrued interest, insurance premiums, real estate tax advances, or preliminary foreclosure  costs.  \n \nThe primary debt to be refinanced must be secured with a lien against the security \nproperty. For  existing  dwellings, but  not for sites  without  a dwelling, short -term or unsecured \ndebts also may be included in the refinancing if refinancing of these debts is necessary to establish  sound repayment  ability,  the debts  were incurred  for purposes  that are eligible  under \nSection 502, and they do not represent a significant portion of the loan. \n \n3. Timing  of the Debt  \n \nIn general, the debt to be refinanced must have been incurred before the application was \nfiled. Costs incurred after the application date, but before loan closing, may be refinanced if: (1) they are incurred  for legal  fees or other  technical  services  related  to the property, or for materials, \nconstruction or site acquisition; (2) the applicant is unable to pay the costs from personal resources or to obtain credit from other sources; and (3) failure to authorize the use of Agency funds to pay such costs would jeopardize the applicant’s ability to repay the loan. The applicant should consult with the Loan Originator before incurring such expenses.  \n \n4. Verification  of Debt  \nTo verify that the debt to be refinanced meets these requirements, the Loan Originator \nshould send Form RD 3550- 30, Verification of Debt Proposed for Refinancing, to each creditor \nwhose  debt is proposed for refinancing.  The form,  which  asks for account  information as well as \na copy of the original debt and security instrument, should be accompanied by a preaddressed, postage -paid envelope (sufficient enough to cover the cost of and large enough to hold the \nmultiple -paged  instruments)  and Form  RD 3550- 1, Authorization to Release Information, which \nauthorized the respondent to release this information. \n \n \n \n \n_______________________________________________________________________________ \n6-8"

Since the modest determination  must  be made  when the  purchase agreement \nor construction package is submitted, if t he property is \ndeemed modest but the appraised value subsequently comes in higher than the area loan limit - the property will \nstill be considered modest.  \nMaximum Loan Amount.

The sample calculations \nprovided in this section  are intended to help the Loan  Originator  understand how the calculation \nworks so that it can be explained to the applicant.  \n \nA. Three Types  of Subsidy  \n \n1. Interest  Credit  \n \nA borrower who initially received subsidy in the form of interest credit can continue \nto do so as long as the borrower  remains  eligible  and continuously receives  interest  credit \nassistance.  Subsequent  loans  to these borrowers  should be  subsidized with  interest  credit. \nParagraph 6.13 of this Chapter  describes the method for calculating subsidies using the \ninterest credit method.  \n \n2. Payment  Assistance  Method  1 \n \nA borrower  currently  receiving  payment  assistance  using payment  assistance method \n1 will continue to receive it for the initial loan as the borrower is eligible for payment assistance method 1. However, if a borrower receiving payment assistance method 1 receives a subsequent loan, payment assistance method 2 will be used to calc ulate the \nsubsidy for the initial loan and subsequent loan.

Payment  Assistance  Method  2 \n \nAll other  eligible  applicants  will receive payment  assistance method 2.

Borrowers  who  cease  to receive \ninterest credit or payment assistance method 1 for 6 months or more will receive payment assistance method 2 if they subsequently begin to receive payment subsidies.

Income Eligibility  \n \nApplicants who obtain loans on nonprogram terms are not eligible for payment \nsubsidies. To be eligible for an initial loan at the time of origination, an applicant must \nbe income -eligible  for the Section  502 loan -- that is, have  adjusted  income  that does not \nexceed the applicable low -income limit at the time of loan approval and the applicable \nmoderate- income limit at the time of loan closing. When an existing Agency loan is \nbeing refinanced as a special servicing action including, but not limited to, foll owing a \nmoratorium, the househo ld’s adjusted income must not exceed the applicable moderate \nincome limit for the area at the time of loan approval and closing.  Initial approval of \npayment subsidy for borrowers who become eligible after loan closing is the responsibility of the Servicing Office. A borrower who is receiving payment subsidy can continue to receive it, even if their income exceeds the moderate income limit, as long as their subsidized rate does not exceed the note rate.  \n2. Occupancy  Requirement  \n \nTo be eligible  to receive a payment  subsidy, the applicant  must  occupy the dwelling \nas their principal residence, unless during the term of the loan the Agency determines that the dwelling is uninhabitable or that the borrower may be absent temporarily from the property for reasons acceptable to the Agency, such as seasonal or mi gratory \nemployment, military call- ups, or hospitalization. A dwelling is considered a principal \nresidence when physically occupied by the owner on a permanent basis (i.e. lives ther e \nfor the majority of the year and is the address of record for such activities as Federal income tax reporting, voter registration, occupational licensing, etc.).  \n \nC. Loan  Requirements  \n \n1. Loan  Term  \n \nFor an applicant to be eligible for a payment subsidy, initial loans and subsequent \nloans made in conjunction with a new rates and terms assumption must have a term of at \nleast 25 years. Borrowers can receive a payment subsidy for a subsequent loan not made \nin conjunction with an assumption with a term of less than 25 years,  if the initial loan had \na term of at least 25 years.  \n \n2.

The borrower must sign Form RD 3550- 12, Subsidy Repayment Agreement, at the time of loan closing for existing \nproperties, when a construction loan is converted to a permanent loan, or whenever the borrower qualifies for payment subsidy for the first t ime. \nThe amount to be recaptured is determined by a calculation specified in the borrower’s \nsubsidy repayment agreement and is based on the borrower’s equity in the property at the time of loan pay off. If there is no equity based  on the recapture calculation,  the amount  of principal \nreduction attributed to subsidy is not collected. The recapture calculation includes the amount \nof principal reduction attributed to subsidy plus the lesser of:  \n• The amount  of subsidy received; or  \n• A portion of the value appreciation of the property subject to recapture. In order \nfor the value appreciation to be calculated, the borrower will provide a current appraisal, including an appraisal for any capital improvements, or arm’s length sales  contract  as evidence of market  value upon Agency  request.  Appraisals  must \nmeet Agency standards.  \n \n6.12 CALCULATING  PAYMENTASSISTANCE  \nA. Payment  Assistance  Method  2 \nThe amount  of payment  assistance granted  is the lesser  of the difference between:  \n• The annualized promissory note installments for the combined RHS loan and \neligible  leveraged  loans  plus the cost of taxes  and insurance  less 24 percent  of the \nborrower’s adjusted income, or \n• The annualized  promissory  note installment for the RHS  loan less amount  the \nborrower  would pay if the loan were  amortized  at an interest  rate of 1 percent.  \nBorrowers  receiving  payment  assistance method 2 must  pay the greater  of: \n• A payment  to RHS  based  on 24 percent  of their adjusted  annual  income  less the \namortized payment for the eligible leveraged loan less the cost of taxes and insurance; or  \n• A payment  to RHS  based  on an interest  rate of 1 percent  plus the amortized \npayment for the eligible leveraged loan plus the cost of taxes and insurance.  \n \nAn eligible  leveraged  loan is a loan with payments  amortized  over a period of not less \nthan 30 years and an interest rate that does not exceed 3 percent.  \n \n6-20"

Calculating  the Approvable  Loan  at Standard  Terms  \n \nOnce the required  information is entered,  the worksheet  automatically  computes  the PITI \nand TD ratios, determines whether the applicant is eligible for a payment subsidy and the amount, and determines whether the applicant can afford the selected property using standard loan terms. If UniFi indicates that the loan can be approved, the Lo an Originator should prepare \nthe loan approval package, as described in Paragraph 6.17 of this Chapter . \n \nB. Working with  Applicants  Who Do Not Qualify  Using  Standard Terms  \n \nIf the applicant  cannot  be approved for a loan using standard  terms,  the Loan  Originator \nshould determine whether any of the adjustments described below are possible. If any of the adjustments make the loan feasible, the Loan Originator should prepare the loan approval package, as described in Paragraph 6.17 of this Chapter . \n \n1. Possible  Applicant  Actions  to Make a Loan  Feasible  \n \nThe Loan Originator should discuss with the applicant options for enhancing their \nability  to obtain Agency  financing including:  (1) identifying additional  parties  to the note;  \n(2) seeking down payment assistance or other assistance programs to supplement the Agency  loan;  (3) providing an additional  down payment  to reduce the principal  amount \nof the loan; (4) seeking a less expensive dwelling; or (5) obtaining leverage funds with terms more favorable than available from the Agency. \n \n2. Possible  Agency  Actions  to Make a Loan  Feasible \n \nThe Loan Originator  should first  consider any compensating  factors,  as described in \nChapter 4 Paragraph  4.24 A of this Handbook, that have  not yet been  considered  and \ndoes not result  in multiple  risk layering. The Loan Originator should then recompute the \nloan using a 38- year term provided the applicant’s income qualifies for a 38 -year loan.   \nA Certificate of E ligibility  issued for a 38- year term  must not be reduced to a 33- year \nterm if the purchase price is lowered after COE issuance, unless the lower term is requested by the applicant and the applicant can afford payment s at the lesser term.  \nOtherwise, the term will only be reduced by the Agency when the type of property being purchased changes to manufactured housing.

The Agency has an interest in making sure that these costs are paid in order to protect the property from tax sale or foreclosure, and to make sure that funds will be available to repair the property should it be damaged.  \n \nSECTION  1: ESCROW [7 CFR 3550.60]  \n \n7.2 OVERVIEW  \n \nTo ensure that funds are available to pay for the cost of real estate taxes, insurance \npremiums, and other assessments when they come due, the Agency requires borrowers who receive new loans -- whether initial or subsequent -- to deposit monthly funds to a n escrow \naccount in order to be used to pay the borrower’s tax and insurance bills. These funds are included in the borrower’s regular monthly payment. An escrow account must be established at loan closing for all loans with a total outstanding indebtednes s greater than $15,000 (be it 502, \n504, or combination thereof)  except  new construction. This is because loan payments  are not due \nduring construction. Since the exact amount of taxes, insurance premiums and assessments are not known in advance, a cushion is established at closing to help ensure that there will be sufficient funds available to pay the bills. If the Agency underest imates the amount needed, the \nAgency will advance funds to pay the tax or insurance bill and  raise the borrower's escrow \npayments during the following year to repay the amount advanced. If the Agency overestimates the funds needed, a refund may be issued i f the amount is greater than $50. If the amount of \noverage is less than $50, it will be credited to the next year’s escrow. Annual -pay borrowers are \nexempt from the escrow requirement but  are responsible for timely payment of taxes and \ninsurance premiums. The Agency will not escrow where the security property is located on a farm tract also financed by the Farm Service Agency (FSA), and we are unable to obtain a separate tax bill. FSA will be responsible  for paying taxes  in these situations.  The only except ion \nto this is for a Section 504 loan over $15,000 on a farm tract (see Chapter 12, Paragraph  12.10 of \nthis Handbook).  \n \n \n \n  \n \nCHAPTER  7: ESCROW,  TAXES,  AND  INSURANCE  \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL PN  \nRevised ( 11-06-24) PN 628"

    "content": "HB-1-3550  \nParagraph  7.2 Overview  \n \nThe Agency will establish and administer escrow accounts in accordance with the \nIntegrated Mortgage Disclosures under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act and the Truth \nIn Lending Act (TRID) and section 501(e) of the Housing Act of 1949, as amended.  \n \nThe Agency  requires  most  borrowers  who receive  new loans  to escrow  funds  for taxes \nand insurance. Borrowers are exempt from escrow if they:  \n \n• Are current ly on an annual payment plan or have an existing  RHS  escrow account ; \n• Have a leveraged loan and the  escrow  is maintained  by the primary  lending \ninstitution; \n \n• Have received  only a  Section  504 grant;  \n• Have a Section  504 loan(s)  with  a total outstanding balance of  $15,000 or  less,  and \nthe Agency determines there is no risk to the Government’s security interest in the property;  \n \n• Assumed  a loan on same rates  and terms;  or \n• Have security property which includes a farm and the property is not subdivided \nbetween the farm and non -farm tract. In these cases, the Agency may still elect to \nrequire  escrow  where the housing represents  the majority  of the value  of the security \nproperty or it is in the Agency’s best interest to require  escrow.  \n \nThe Servicing and Asset Management Office (Servicing Office) is responsible for \nadministering the escrow account. However, the Loan Originator is responsible for determining the monthly escrow deposit contribution during the first year, ensuring that the appropriate amount  is collected  at closing  to establish  the escrow  account  and to educate  the borrower  about \nwhat escrow accounts are and how they work.  \n \n7.3 ESCROW  DEPOSITS  \n \nEscrow accounts are funded from 3 sources -- monthly payments, an initial deposit \nrequired  at closing, and funds  from  the seller  to cover  taxes  accrued  prior  to closing. Exhibit  7-1 \nillustrates the calculation of the initial deposit and monthly escrow payments.  \n       \n7-2"

Monthly  Payment  \n \nThe borrower's monthly installment includes not only the amount due for principal and \ninterest,  but also 1/12 of the anticipated  amount  required for taxes,  insurance, other  assessments \nfor the year, plus a cushion as authorized by TRID. \n \nB. Borrower’s  Initial Deposit  to the Escrow  Account  \n \nOver the course of a year the borrower's monthly payments should provide the amount \nneeded to pay all tax, insurance (including flood insurance as applicable), and other assessment \nbills. However, the timing of the payments may be such that a bill comes due before the borrower  has made sufficient  payments  to cover  the cost. To avoid this problem, the borrower  is \nrequired to make an initial deposit to the escrow account that is large enough to ensure that all anticipated payments can be met when they come due, but that at its low point the account contains no more than the equivalent of 2 monthly escrow payments . \n \nC. Seller’s  Tax Liability  \n \nTaxes  must  be prorated  between  the buyer  and the seller.  To ensure  that funds  from  the \nseller’s  pro rata share  of the taxes  are available to pay the taxes  when  they come due, funds  are \ncollected at closing to pay the borrower’s closing costs or initial escrow deposit. Prorated tax funds may not be paid to the applicant/borrower other than for reimbursement of certain items paid by the applicant outside of closing. See  Chapter 8  Paragraph 8.6 F  of this Handbook for \nadditional guidance.  \n \n7.4 CALCULATING  ESCROW  AMOUNTS  \n \nThe Loan  Originator  must  provide  UniFi  with tax and insurance  figures  that are then used \nto estimate the maximum loan amount, to determine the amount of loan funds to obligate, and to establish monthly payments and the initial deposit to the escrow account.  \n \nAlthough tax and insurance  information  used early  in the process  will be based  on rough \nestimates, the Loan Originator should make every effort to obtain accurate information about historic and future costs so that later entries will be as accurate as possible. For construction loans, when calculating the escrow payment for closing, the  Field Office is to use the amount \nneeded to cover the real estate taxes for the upcoming 12 months. The Loan Originator must consider that there may be a re -assessment of the real estate tax es upon the completion of the \ndwelling and the escrow calculations will be made accordingly.  \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL PN  \nRevised ( 11-06-24) PN 628 7-3"

UniFi  prepares  Form  RD 3550- 9, Initial Escrow  Account  Disclosure  Statement,  described  in \nParagraph 7.5. The following example is intended to show how escrow accounts are funded each year.  \nAssumptions : \n(1) The loan closing  occurs  on April  12, 2020 with the first payment  due May 12, 2020  \n(2) Taxes  of $753  are paid in July and December  \n(3) Hazard  insurance  of $1,228.00  is paid in March  \n(4) The Agency  requires  a minimum  balance equal  to 2 months  of payments  \nMonthly  Payment  Calculation : \n$ 753.00  \n$ 753.00  \n$1,228.00  \n$2,734.00 Total  anticipated  escrow  disbursements  divided by 12 equals  \n$ 227.83 per month  escrow  payment  \n \nMonth  Payments  to Escrow  Disbursements  Balance  \n \nLoan  Closing  $683.53  $ 0.00 \n$ 0.00 \n$ 0.00 \n$ 753.00  \n$ 0.00 \n$ 0.00 \n$ 0.00 \n$ 0.00 \n$ 753.00  \n$ 0.00 \n$ 0.00 \n$1,228.00  \n$ 0.00  \n$ 683.53  \n$ 911.36  \n$1,139.19  \n$ 614.02  \n$ 841.85  \n$1,069.68  \n$1,297.51  \n$1,525.34  \n$1,000.17  \n$1,228.00  \n$1,455.83  \n$ 455.66  \n$ 683.49  \nThe borrower will be required  to pay $227.83 per month  and will also be required  to fund the escrow  account \nat closing in the amount of $683.53. Part of the tax payment component of the initial escrow deposit will be contributed by the seller for the period from January 1st to the closing on April 12th.  \nAccording to TRID, the lending institution may at some time during the year achieve an escrow balance that does \nnot exceed  2 monthly  escrow  payments.  In this example the balance equal  to 2 monthly  payments  ($455.66),  occurs \nin March after the payment for hazard insurance.  \nThe Servicing Office is required to perform an escrow analysis within 12 months of the first payment and every \nyear thereafter. The actual running escrow balance from the prior year will become the basis for projecting the necessary  escrow  payment  for the next year.  The low point  achieved  will be compared  to the projected  minimum  of \n$455.66.  If\n  the low point  is below  $455.66,  the loan will be deemed  to have  a shortage.  If the low point  is greater \nthan $50, the loan will have a surplus, which will be refunded to the borrower. If the surplus is less than $50, the \namount will be credited to the next year’s escrow.

If real estate taxes \nare due within 60 days of the date of closing, the Closing Agent/Attorney should pay the real \nestate taxes and provide the remaining amount to the Servicing Office. \n \n7.6 CONSTRUCTION LOANS  \n \nDuring the construction period, borrowers  must be counseled  that they are responsible for \npayment of taxes which come due since loan payments are not due during the construction \nperiod. The borrower is also responsible for the initial escrow deposit when construction is complete. Field Staff should complete Attachment 7 -A of this Chapter to determine the \nborrower’s full tax and insurance needs during the construction period. Funds for the payment of taxes during construction, and for the initial escrow deposit which includes both taxes and insurance, can be handled by one of the following two methods. \n \n• One method would be to include any  taxes  that must be paid during construction and \nthe initial escrow deposit in the loan amount. This option is at the discretion of the applicant, and is subject to loan underwriting standards. If this option is used, the applicant  must be counseled  that they are responsible for delivering the tax bill to the \nField Staff so a loan check can be requested to pay the taxes. The applicant is responsible to follow-up with Field Staff, or the taxing authority, to ensure their tax payments were paid on time. If the initial escrow deposit was included in the loan, the applicant must also be counseled that they are responsible for funding any shortages. This may occur if the construction is delayed.  \n \n• The other method would be for the applicant  to pay any taxes  which  come  due during \nconstruction with personal funds while saving funds to make the initial escrow deposit at the end of the construction period. Should an applicant choose this option, they must be counseled to pay the tax bills when due and provide a copy to the Field Office. The applicant must also be counseled on how much will be required at the end of the construction period to adequately fund the initial escrow deposit. \n    \n \n \n7-5 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL PN  \nRevised ( 11-06-24) PN 628"

The Servicing \nOffice will generally increase the monthly payments scheduled for the remainder of the escrow cycle to compensate for any shortage. The Servicing Office may also elect to charge the borrower’s account for the shortage and reamortize the loan.  \n \n7.7 SERVICING  ESCROW  ACCOUNTS  \n \nThe Servicing Office will handle ongoing actions related to escrow accounts, including \ncollecting  monthly payments, depositing funds  into the escrow  account,  and handling all tax and \ninsurance payments. The Servicing Office will conduct the annual escrow account analysis and send annual  escrow  disclosure  statements  to borrowers  to give  an escrow  account  history for the \npast year, including any differences between what was estimated and what was actually disbursed."

For existing \nproperties, the Loan  Originator  can contact  the real estate agent,  the seller,  and/or  the local  taxing \nauthority to determine current taxes and whether any reassessment or tax rate increase is \nanticipated.  \n \nIt will be more difficult for the Loan Originator to estimate taxes when dealing with \nplanned new construction or a newly constructed property that has not yet been assessed. To make this estimate,  the Loan  Originator  will use comparable existing  residential  property values \nin the market area for the first year, in order to prevent significant increases in the second year escrow  payment  as a result  of the increase in property  value  to make this estimate.  Any prorated \namount of taxes to be paid by the seller should be based on the current assessment, even if it is not recent and does not reflect the actual value of the house.  \n \n7.9 TAX SERVICE  FEE  \n \nEach new borrower will be charged  a one -time tax service fee at the time of loan closing. \nThe fee covers  the cost of a tax monitoring service  to track  tax payments  due, determine  the most \nadvantageous time to pay them, and arrange for payment of the taxes to be disbursed from the borrower’s escrow account. State Directors  are responsible for determining the tax exempt status \nof Native  American  reservation,  tribal,  and trust  land and notifying those  Field  Offices  which  are \naffected. If the land is tax exempt, meaning no real estate taxes are assessed or charged, then a tax service fee will not be collected. Individual plots that are typically owned in fee simple are generally subject to taxation and a tax service fee wil l be collected.  Borrowers who are  \nobtaining a subsequent loan will not pay a second tax service fee. Refer to the tax service fee schedule  shown in  Attachment  7-B of this Chapter to  determine  the fee charged  for new  loans  \nand new  rates  and terms assumptions. \n \n7.10 TAX INFORMATION SHEET  \n \nAt closing, the Loan Approval Official or Designee will review, update, and return a \ncopy of the completed  Form  RD 3550- 15, Tax Information, to the Closing  Agent/Attorney with \nother closing documents. Form RD 3550- 15 should list all of the local taxing authorities to \nwhich taxes are due, the amounts, the due dates, the parcel identification number, and a legal description of the property. All of this information is needed t o allow the Servicing Office to \nmanage the escrow account effectively and to protect the borrower from a shortage in their escrow account."

The applicant will learn about the \nAgency’s requirements and borrower’s responsibilities regarding insurance during applicant orientation.  \nAfter  the loan  is closed,  the Servicing  Office  is responsible  for handling most  insurance  issues.  \nThe Field Office is likely to become involved only if the Servicing Office requests assistance to determine  whether  adequate repairs  have been  made to a property for which \nan insurance claim has been paid.  \n7.12 TYPES  OF INSURANCE  \n \nA. Hazard  Insurance  \n \nMost borrowers are required to \nmaintain  hazard  insurance  to protect  the \nproperty against fire and weather - \nrelated  damage (these policies  may also \nbe called “Fire and Extended Coverage,” “Homeowner’s,” “All Physical Loss,” or “Broad Form” policies). Hazard insurance is not required  if the total outstanding Agency \ndebt and any senior liens against the property are equal to or less than $15,000.  \n \nB. Flood  Insurance  \nFlood insurance  is required  when  any form  of federal  financial  assistance  which  is intended \nin whole or in part for the acquisition, construction, reconstruction or substantial improvement  of any building located  in a Special  Flood Hazard  Area  (SFHA),  as identified \nby the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP), administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and described in RD Instruction 426.2. \n \nSubstantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other \nimprovement  of a structure,  the cost of which  equals  or exceeds  50 percent  of the market \nvalue  of the structure  (a) before  the start of construction of the improvement, or (b) if the \nstructure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred.  \n \n \n7-8 \nMaster  Policies  \nA master policy is one containing substantially the same \nstandard provisions adopted or recommended by legislative \naction or by order of the State’s insurance authority and \nensures that the policy meets State requirements. The Loan \nOriginator  should  require  a master  policy,  unless  State  statutes \nexempt the company from the regulations requiring its use. In \norder  for a company’s  policy  to be approved  by the Agency,  it \nmust  submit  a copy of the master  policy  and all attachments  to \nthe State Office for review and approval.  \nIn States  without  master  policies,  Field  Staff  will ensure  that \npolicies meet the requirements of Attachment 7 -C. \nMany  State  Directors  issue  State  Supplements  to help Field \nStaff identify acceptable insurance policies."

A policy issued only to a contractor is not an acceptable substitute for the property insurance a borrower is required to provide.

For loans secured by other than a first lien, a copy of the policy or declaration \npage, or other evidence of insurance, is acceptable. The applicant may submit a written binder in lieu of the policy or declaration page, as long as the policy will be submitted to the Servicing Office within 60 days of closing. Existing borrowers already on escrow \nsubmitting  an application  for a subsequent loan are not required  to provide evidence of a full \nyears paid premium. \n \n7.14 AUTHORIZED INSURANCE  PROVIDERS  \n \nBorrowers  must purchase their policies  from  approved  insurance companies  licensed \nto do business in the State where the property is located. If the required insurance is not available at  comparable rates  from  a State -licensed  insurance company, the Loan  Originator \nmay accept insurance from another company if: \n \n• The Office of General Counsel (OGC) confirms that policies issued by the \ncompany are enforceable despite the fact that the company is not licensed to conduct business in the State,  and the company  is a legal  entity  that may be sued \nin the State where the property is located;  and \n \n• The State  Director  determines  that the company is reputable and financially  sound, \nbased on the company’s financial statements, industry rating standards, or information available from the State insurance authority, or other lending institutions.  \n \n7.15 REVIEWING  INSURANCE  POLICIES  \n \nThe borrower must submit evidence of insurance to the closing agent before or at the \ntime of closing. The closing agent will review the policy, declaration page, or binder to ensure that it meets the requirements outlined in Attachment 7 -C of this Chapter . If it is acceptable, the \nevidence of coverage should be kept in the borrower’s case file after closing. If the borrower’s policy or evidence is insufficient, the closing agent should explain why it is not acceptable (for example, there is not an adequate amount of coverage,  it is not in the correct  name,  or the \npremium has not been paid). The closing will be postponed until suitable evidence has been \nprovided to the closing agent. \n \n7-11 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL PN  \nRevised  (11-06-24) PN 628"

Loss  or Damage  Covered  \nHazard  insurance  policies  must  insure  buildings  against  loss or damage by fire, lightning, \nwindstorm, hail, explosion, riot, civil commotion, aircraft, vehicles, and smoke. The flood \ninsurance, if applicable, must cover any damage due to flooding conditions. \nB. Amount  \nThe Loan  Originator  must  require  borrowers  with  a total indebtedness  of more  than \n$15,000 to obtain hazard insurance to cover the dwelling and any other essential buildings (such as a garage). The minimum required hazard insurance coverage is the lesser of the insurable value (i.e. the cost to restore the property back to its state prior to a loss) of the dwelling and other essential buildings, or the outstanding principal balance of the loan. Although the lesser of these two amounts is required, the Loan Originator should encourage the borrower to obtain hazard  insurance  coverage in the amount  greater of  the insurable  value  of the dwelling  and other \nessential buildings, or the outstanding principal balance of the loan.  \nFlood insurance  must  cover  the lesser of the outstanding principal  balance of the loan or \nthe maximum amount  of coverage allowed  under  FEMA’s  National  Flood Insurance  Program \n(NFIP).  \nThe policy must  state  whether  or not the building is on a  leasehold.  State  Supplements \nprovide  guidance  on specific  State  insurance  requirements  pertaining to leasehold  interests.  \nC. Borrower’s  Deductible  \nThe borrower’s deductible may not exceed the generally accepted minimums based on \ncurrent  industry standards  and local  market  conditions. Typically, the borrower’s  hazard \ninsurance deductible  will be no greater than  2 percent of the face value of the policy , not to \nexceed  $5,000 unless State law requires a higher maximum deductible amount. This deductible \nlimit also applies to builder’s risk policies in place during any applicable  construction period.  In \nareas where such deductibles are not reasonably available due to local market conditions, i.e. areas on coastal lines or prone to high winds, State  Supplements  will be issued  with prior  \nNational  Office approval  to provide  guidance for current market deductibles. The supplemental \nguidance must identify the specific areas, the associated amount and the detailed justification for each area in the St ate that is authorized for higher deductibles.  Use caution when authorizing \nhigher deductibles so not to cause undue hardship for a borrower.  For flood insurance, these deductibles apply unless the insurance carrier requires a higher deductible amount .  \nD. Term  \nThe policy must  have  a term of at least 1 year,  with  evidence  that 1 year’s  premium has \nbeen paid prior to or at closing. \n  \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL PN  \nRevised ( 11-06-24) PN 628"

Section 2 of this Chapter describes the steps the Loan Originator and the closing agent must take to prepare the loan for closing. Section 3 of this Chapter describes the steps required to actually obtain funds for the closing and ensure that the closing is accomplished. Section 4 of this Chapter describes the process for administering construction loans.  \n \nSECTION  1: LOAN  APPROVAL  AND  OBLIGATION  \n \n8.2 THE  LENDING  DECISION \n \nIf the underwriting analysis indicates that the loan should be approved, the Loan Originator \nmust submit a complete case file to the Loan Approval Official. The Loan Approval Official should review  all of the documents  contained  in the case file  to ensure  that they are completed  properly, and \nmust  confirm  that the Loan  Originator’s  underwriting decision  is sound.

    "content": "HB-1-3550  \n \n \n8.3 OBLIGATING  FUNDS  \n \nA. Initial Obligation  \n \nA loan must be approved and obligated the same day. Form RD 3550- 7 must be signed \nand dated  by the Loan  Approval  Official  at the time of loan approval  and obligation. Therefore, \nForm RD 3550- 7 or any approval letter must not be issued to the applicant unless the loan has \nbeen approved and obligated.  \n \nAs soon as the Loan Approval Official approves the loan and signs Form RD 3550- 7, \nthe Loan Originator will obligate  funds  through LoanServ. The executed Form RD 3550- 7 \nmust be stored in the recipient’s case file in ECF.   If, after 15 days Form  RD 3550- 7 is not \nsigned and returned, the Loan Originator must deobligate the loan and complete Form RD \n1940- 10, Cancellation of U.S.  Treasury  Check  and/or  Obligation . Once the loan has been \ndeobligated, the application is withdrawn. Should the applicant express interest in another \nloan, a new application must be filed, and would be processed based on the new application date.  \n \nLoan  approval  and funds  obligation may also trigger  re-disclosure  of the Loan  Estimate  if \nthe interest rate and/or closing costs at loan approval are greater than disclosed on the original Loan Estimate. If a revised Loan Estimate is required, it must be issued within 3 business days  \nof loan approval/obligation but no later than 4 business days prior to loan consummation  \n(7 business  days if the revised  Loan  Estimate  is mailed  to the applicant).  \n \nB. Changing  the Loan  Amount  \n \nIf the loan amount must be increase d or decreased prior to loan closing, any paperwork \nthat reflects or is affected by the loan amount must be revised . The closing agent and the \napplicant must return any loan closing forms that have already been distributed so that they can be revised  appropriately. Exhibit  8-1 of this Chapter illustrates  the steps  for making changes  to the \nloan amount.  When an increase in the obligation amount  is needed , the Agency has 15 days \nfrom when funds become available to adjust the amount in the appropriate system and a new Form RD 3550- 7 must be issued.  The applicant has 15 days from date of the form to sign and \nreturn it.  \n \nNOTE : Form RD 1940- 10, Cancellation of U.S. Treasury Check and/or Obligation, must \nbe completed for any  deobligation (full or partial) .  This must be signed by the Loan Approval \nOfficial  within 5 business days after allotted appeal timeframe  has expired  (if applicable) , or \nwithin 5 business days once it has been determined funds are no longer needed or valid (if appeal rights are not given) .  Deobligation processing must occur within 15 business days from \ndate/signature on Form RD 1940- 10. \n \nIf a loan amount  must  be increased  or decreased  for a prior  fiscal  year,  the Field  Office \nshould contact the Servicing and Asset Management Office (Servicing Office) Disbursement Unit. All requests to increase the obligation amount for a direct loan with prior fiscal year funds are subject to the availability of funds at the time for the  request. The Servicing Office \nDisbursement Unit will make the required corrections to the obligation amount.\n \n \n8-2"

In \nsituations where the cancellation is not the applicant’s choice, Appendix 3, Handbook Letter  15 (3550)  \nof this Handbook must indicate any  action  that can be taken  to correct  or appeal  the decision. It is the \napplicant’s responsibility to notify the seller and any contractors of the  cancellation.  \n \nD. Monitoring  Obligations:  \n \nThe National  Office  posts  an Undisbursed Obligation  report  to SharePoint  each month so \nthat State Offices can monitor undisbursed obligations over 180 days. This monthly report must \nbe reviewed utilizing Attachment 8 -B of this Chapter , Unliquidated Obligation Review , and \nmust be  saved in the recipient’s case file within ECF. Timely usage of funds is essential and aids \nthe Agency in ensuring that program dollars are not deobligated in the following fiscal year, making them unavailable to fund other applications. The monitoring of a State’s unliquidated obligations should consider the circumstances of the loan, determine the need for the remaining funds, and whether a full or partial deobligation should occur. Based on the monitoring proc ess \nin place, e.g., monthly reviews identified in Attachment 8- B of this Chapter , these  should be \nused to provide a status on the semi -annual ULO Certification report.  \nIn conjunction with the Undisbursed Obligation report , National Office  also posts the \nLoans Fully Disbursed, not Activated report  to SharePoint each month so the State Offices can \nmonitor loan funds  which  have been fully disbursed, but the loan has not  yet been activated .  \nTimely activation is essential to ensure borrower repayment begins promptly, to avoid negative impact s for the borrower and the Agency .      \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n  \n \n8-4"

    "content": "HB-1-3550  \nSECTION  2: PREPARING  FOR  CLOSING  \n \n8.4 TITLE INSURANCE  AND CLOSING  AGENTS  \n \nFor most loans, the Agency requires title insurance, and requires that the loan closing be \nconducted by a closing agent who meets the Agency’s standards. This paragraph summarizes the \nAgency’s requirements for title insurance and closing agents, and the pr ocedures for approving \nthe individuals  and firms  that provide  those  services.  Details  about  these procedures  can be found \nin RD Instruction 1927- B. \n \nA. Title  Insurance  \n \nTitle  insurance  is required for most  loans  unless  the State  Director  determines  that the use \nof title insurance is not possible, is not economically feasible for the type of loan involved, or in \nthe area of the State where the loan will be made. In these cases, an attorney’s opinion can be \naccepted. If the total outstanding balance of any unse cured (note only) Section 502 loans is less \nthan $7,500, title insurance is not required. If the total outstanding balance on Section 504 loans is $25,000 or less, title insurance is not required. Title insurance is not require d for loans made  \non tribal trust land when a certified Title Status Report is issued by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. \n \nB. Closing  Agents  \n \nAn attorney or title company may act as a closing agent and close Agency real estate \nloans, provide necessary title clearance services, and perform other closing- related duties \nprescribed by the Agency. A closing agent approved by the Agency is required for all section 502 loans  of $7,500 or greater  and for 504 loans  where the total outstanding  balance is greater \nthan $25,000 with the exception of a subsequent loan made for minimum essential repairs necessary to  protect the  Government’s interest. When feasible, loans made on tribal  trust land \ndo not require a closing agent as they may be closed by the Agency in conjunction with the Bureau of Indian Affairs.  \n \nC. Approvals  \n \nState Offices maintain a list of title insurance companies that are authorized to provide \ntitle insurance in the State. Each approved title insurance company may provide a master list of \ntitle companies and attorneys that are covered by its closing protect ion letter and are thereby \nauthorized to perform closings on behalf of that title insurance company. The State Office \ndetermines  which  title insurance  companies  will be authorized  to issue  title insurance  policies  for \nAgency loans based on RD Instruction 1927- B. \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________  \n8-5 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL PN  \nRevised  (03-09-22) SPECIAL PN"

If the attorney  or title company selected  is not on the list, \nthey should provide an acceptable closing protection letter from an approved title insurance \ncompany.  \n \nAlternatively, title companies may submit Form RD 1927 -20, Certification of Title \nInsurance  Company, and attorneys  may submit  Form  RD 1927- 19, Certification  of Attorney, to \nrequest Agency approval. \n \nD.

Applicants must put the request in their \nown words, not on a document provided by the Agency.  If revisions to the Closing Disclosure \nare needed after it has been provided to the applicant, an additional three business day waiting period will be  required.  \nC. Re-verifying Employment , Income, and Assets  \n \nThe Loan Originator must obtain an oral verification of employment (VOE) within 10 \nbusiness days prior to the closing date if the applicant has worked for the employer for less than a year or the other types of verifications are inconsistent or suspicious. A written verification of employment, dated within 10 business days prior to the closing date, may be accepted  in lieu of an \noral VOE.

All re -verification activity should be documented carefully.  \nIf the income  re-verification  indicates  a significant  change  in income,  the Loan \nOriginator should take the following steps:  \n \n• Verify  that the applicant  is still income -eligible.  A program  loan cannot  be granted  if \nthe applicant’s adjusted income exceeds the moderate -income level at closing. \nRegardless of whether the applicant’s income decreases or increases to change their status from very -low or low income, no changes are needed on the loan obligation. \n(There ar e no income restrictions for non- program  applicants.)  \n \n• Determine  whether  the applicant  is eligible  for payment  subsidy. Payment  subsidy \nmay be granted if the applicant’s adjusted income is at or below the applicable moderate- income  limit.  \n \n• Consider  whether  the applicant  could obtain 100 percent  private  financing and refer \nthe applicant to a private lender, if appropriate.  \n \n• Confirm  that the applicant  has adequate repayment  ability.  \n \n \n  \n \n \n8-10"

Special  Documents  for Assumptions  \n \nWhether new funds are obligated or existing loan funds are recycled through an \nassumption is primarily an accounting function and is largely transparent to the \npurchaser and seller. However, there are 3 procedural differences that will affect the purchaser and the seller. First, the purchaser must sign Form RD 3550- 22, Assumption \nAgreement Single Family Housing, at closing. Second, the original note is not returned to the seller. Instead, the note is amended to indicate that it has been assumed. The original  Promissory  Note,  with a copy of Form  RD 3550- 22 attached,  is kept in a locked \nfire-proof file. Copies are placed in the purchas er’s case file. Third, Form RD 3550- 16, \nRelease from Personal Liability, is provided to the seller at closing. The agreement is executed to release the seller from all personal liability for the amount of debt being assumed. In cases where the debt is not being assumed in full, the Servicing Office will \nhandle the settlement of the remaining debt and any release of liability for that portion \nof the debt not being assumed. \nUnless required by State law, a previous mortgage / deed of trust may be released \nprovided that all previous  promissory notes  and assumption agreements  are listed  on both \nthe new assumption agreement and the new mortgage or deed of trust to ensure that all \ndebts are adequately secured.  \n2.

Subsequent  disbursements  on \nconstruction loans, section 504 Loan and Grant combos, 504 loans, and 504 grants only are requested via the LoanServ system. \n \nAny loan that is closed in the Field Office will use a paper check, i.e. Native American \nloans  closed  via Office  of General  Counsel  (OGC)  and section  502/504 Note  only loans. Checks \nare generated the day they are requested and are dated for 3 days later.  \n \n8.8 ESTABLISHING  THE  DISBURSEMENT  SCHEDULE  \n \nSome borrowers will be able to occupy their dwellings immediately, while others will \nneed to remain in other housing until construction or rehabilitation is complete. To avoid requiring borrowers to repay an Agency loan while continuing to pay other housing costs, borrowers  who cannot  occupy the property within  30 days are permitted  to defer  loan payments.  \n \nA. Permanent  Loans  \n \nIf loan funds are to be used to purchase an existing dwelling or newly built house (that \nwas complete or largely complete when the purchase agreement was signed), or to complete minor  repairs,  such as painting or carpeting,  the borrower  should be able to occupy the property \nwithin 30 days . In these situations, a permanent loan is made and the borrower’s repayment \nobligation begins immediately. Funds for permanent loans are requested in a single  \nadvance. In general, the loan funds are disbursed in full at closing. If funds for repairs are not fully disbursed at loan closing, the undisbursed loan proceeds are deposited into an escrow account  supervised by the closing agent/attorney, or  into a supervised bank account  and disbursed \nin accordance with RD Instruction 1902- A. \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n8-14"

Construction  Loans  \n \nIf loan funds  are to be used to build a new dwelling  or \nto undertake repairs that will prevent the borrower from \noccupying the dwelling for more than 30 days , the loan is \nmade as  a construction  loan. Funds for construction loans are  \ndisbursed in multiple advances that begin to accrue daily simple interest as of disbursement at the borrower’s subsidized rate and will not exceed the note rate. When activating the construction loan, and to ensure that interest accrues at the subsidized rate during construction, \nthe Loan Originator must enter the subsidized rate into LoanServ.  T he deferral period identified  \non Form RD 1940- 16, Promissory Note, should be within the  estimated timeframe to complete  the \nconstruction as identified in the construction contract documents (e.g., Form RD 1924- 6, \nConstruction Contract) . If the construction  period exceed s the estimated deferral period, the Loan \nOriginator will modify the note a nd contact the Servicing and Asset Management Office, SFH \nAssistance Section,  to request the deferral period  to be extended .  \nThe Loan  Originator  will post each disbursement  into LoanServ. LoanServ  will calculate \nand record the amount of the interest accrual during the construction period. The Loan Originator  must  generate the  Approved Eligibility  Summary  from  UniFi  and place it in the \nborrower’s  case file when the construction loan is activated. The construction loan is converted \nfor amortized payments , which will be due the first day of the month as a permanent loan in \nLoanServ , once  the final disbursement is posted in LoanServ and following any of these events:  \n• Final  inspection by the  Agency  or qualified  third  party;  \n• Issuance of the Certificate of  Occupancy  by the local  jurisdiction;  \n• Occupancy  of the new  or repaired  dwelling  \n \nNOTE: If a borrower is unwilling to initial the revised note, the loan may still be \nconverted (see table in Paragraph 8.13 of this Chapter ). \n \nWhen construction funds are not fully expended at loan conversion, all remaining loan \nproceeds  are deposited  into an escrow  account  supervised  by the closing agent/attorney, or into a \nsupervised bank account and disbursed in accordance with RD Instruction 1902- A. Principal \ncurtailments  for construction funds  remaining  after completion  are handled according  to Chapter \n5, Paragraph 5.26 of this Handbook.  \n \nC. Construction  Take -Out Loans  \n \nIf loan funds are to be used to purchase a newly built house where construction had not \nstarted or just started at the time the purchase agreement was signed and where the builder will retain ownership of the lot during construction and fund the construction, the loan is made as a purchase new loan. In this situation, the obligation can occur in advance of construction provided the proposed construction and site meet the property and environmental standards. In addition, the Loan  Originator  should determine  how the construction quality  will be documented \nfollowing the guidance in Chapter 6, Paragraph 6.7 B  of this Handbook. Once the construction \nis complete, the closing is held, and the disbursement schedule follows that of a permanent  loan.  \n \n8-15 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL PN  \nRevised  (11-06-24) PN 628 \n Interest  will always  accrue  at \nthe subsidized rate during the \nconstruction period."

    "content": "HB-1-3550  \nParagraph  8.8 Establishing  the Disbursement  Schedule  \n  Prior to closing, obligations for these loans must be closely monitored. The Loan \nOriginator  should routinely check  in with the builder  and/or  applicant  (e.g. by telephone, \nemail, etc.) to ensure the construction is progressing in a timely manner based on the \nclosing date established on the purchase agreement. Valuation updates or completion reports from the appraiser are not required unless the Agency learns of substantial c hanges \nto the plans or specifications which were not pre -approved by the Loan Approval Official. \n8.9 ESTABLISHING  A REPAYMENT  SCHEDULE  \nA. Monthly  Installments  \n \nThe Loan Originator must indicate the appropriate monthly payment schedule on Form \nRD 1940- 16, Promissory  Note.  Under  no circumstances  will a new loan be scheduled  with an \nannual installment. Borrowers with existing loans specifying annual payments may request conversion to monthly payments and must convert to a monthly payment schedule before any \nsubsequent loan or new payment subsidy is approved. \nB. Housing  Assistance  Program  (HAP)  \n \nHAP  payments  made from  the Housing Choice  Voucher -Homeownership Program \nshould be handled in the following manner. The Loan Originator should:  \n \n• Encourage  the Public  Housing Authority (PHA)  to send  the HAP  (principal,  interest, \ntaxes  and insurance  portion only)  directly  to Rural  Development  (via the appropriate \nlockbox) or to the leveraged lender versus sending it directly to the family. \n• Notify  the PHA of the appropriate  lockbox address  and inform  the PHA that the \ncheck must include the borrower’s name and account number at a minimum. \n• If the PHA elects  to use any other  payment  method, Field  Offices  will be responsible \nfor monitoring these accounts, which will require coordination with the Servicing Office to ensure they remain current.  \n• Accounts that use the Housing Choice Voucher should be designated a “Yes” in the \nfield called  “Section  8 Vouchers”  in the “New  Application  Additional  Set Up Screen” \nin UniFi.  \n8.10 ORIGINAL  EQUITY  \nOriginal equity is calculated using the market value, as defined in Form RD 3550- 12, \nSubsidy Repayment Agreement, at the time of loan approval/obligation for both new and existing properties. Original equity is the difference between current market value a nd the total \nof all Agency and leveraged assistance (including subordinate affordable housing products and/or grants). Prepaid taxes and insurance are not considered original equity, nor are contributions  toward  closing costs.  Form  RD 3550- 12, Subsidy Repayment  Agreement,  contains \nthe original equity amount. Only one agreement should be executed by the subject borrower for the subject property. A new agreement should not be completed when extending additional financing (i.e. subsequent loans) to an existing borrower with an active agreement.  \n \n \n \n8-16"

The Loan Originator and the borrower must each accept the work when the \ncontractor wishes to receive payment. If applicable, proper implementation of mitigation measures required by the environmental assessment also should be reviewed. If the work is acceptable,  the Loan  Originator  should order  a check  with the borrower’s  and contractor’s  names \non it as instructed in Chapter 12 of the DLOS manual. The check is sent to the Field Office, and once received, it should be given only to the borrower for endorsement. After the borrower \nendorses the back of the check, it should be promptly delivered to the  contractor. The payment \nprocess may be expedited if the Loan Originator, borrower, and contractor meet at the dwelling, but this may not be feasible in all instances.  \n \nThe amount of each disbursement for construction loans is determined by the draw \nschedule, which is developed based on the value of the work, according to Marshall and Swift guidelines. To ensure that all work will be completed satisfactorily, the Agency holds back 40 percent of each payment to the contractor, unless the contractor has obtained a Surety Bond, Performance  Bond, or Payment  Bond, in which  case only 10 percent  is held back.  Holdbacks  are \nreleased with the final payment.  \n \n8.13 CONVERT  CONSTRUCTION LOANS  \n \nWhen a construction loan is made, the promissory note is written at the promissory note \nrate; however , when  the loan is activated,  the subsidized rate the borrower  will receive is entered \nin LoanServ as the note rate. This causes interest during the construction period to accrue at the subsidized rate.  \n \nA construction loan is converted to a permanent loan effective on the first of the month \nfollowing final inspection, or occupancy,  or issuance of an occupancy permit.  First payment due \ndate should be the first of the month following the loan conversion. When  the loan is converted to \na permanent loan, the Loan Originator must change the note rate in LoanServ to the note rate that was in effect when the construction loan was made, so that it matches the borrower’s note.  \n \nLoan conversion and the final inspection can occur on the same day provided the local \noffice  receives  a copy of the final occupancy  permit  or other  equivalent  inspection report  prior  to \nthe date of final inspection and funds have been fully disbursed. \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n8-19 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL PN  \nRevised  (06-28-23) PN 585                          Example - Establishing the 1st Payment  Due Date  \n \n    Loan closed -  5/17/21  \n    Final Inspection, Occupancy, or Occupancy Permit  Date - 2/25/22  \n    Loan Conversion Date  - 3/1/22  \n    1st Payment Due Date  - 4/1/22"

    "content": "HB-1-3550  \nParagraph  8.13 Convert  Construction Loans  \n \nA. Modify  Note  and LoanServ  \n \nOn the conversion date,  the Loan  Originator  updates  Form  RD \n1940- 16, Promissory Note, to reflect the new principal amount of the \nloan, including the interest generated during the construction period. \nThe borrower should initial the note to acknowledge the change. The Loan Originator then amortizes the new princi pal amount over the \nremaining  term of the loan. The Loan  Originator  also must  change  the \nnote rate in  LoanServ, which was entered at the applicable subsidized \nrate, to reflect the note rate in effect when the construction loan was made, and change the account number, as directed by the Servicing Office, to reflect the conversion from a construction loan to a permanent  loan. Conversion to the permanent  loan number  will signal \nthe Servicing Office to take over servicing responsibilities.  \n \nB. Update  Payment  Subsidy  \n \nIf the borrower  is eligible  for payment  subsidy, the Loan  Originator  must  reverify  income \nif more than 120 days have passed since the last verification or there is evidence to indicate a \nchange in financial status since the construction loan was made. Income will be verified using the preferred sources. Written verifications may be valid for an additional 60 days with oral reverifications at the end of the 120 days. The Loan Originator must generate Form RD 1944-  \n14, Payment Assistance/Deferred  Mortgage Ass istance Agreement, or Form RD 1944- 6, Interest \nCredit Agreement, and Form RD 3550- 12, Subsidy Repayment Agreement, and obtain the \nappropriate signatures.  \n \nThe LESSER of the sales price including construction/rehabilitation costs, or appraised \nvalue  obtained in connection with the loan approval/obligation is used to determine market  value \non Form RD 3550- 12, Subsidy Repayment Agreement, regardless of the length of the \nconstruction process. For Self -Help loans, the market value is the appraised value as determined \nat the time of loan approval/obligation, which is subject to completion per plans and specifications. If the constru ction is not ultimately finished under the Self -Help program, an \namended Form 3550- 12, Subsidy Repayment Agreement, using the market value definition in \nthis paragraph must be used. If the applicant owns the site free and clear, or if an existing non-  \nAgen cy debt on the site without  a dwelling  will not be refinanced  with Agency  funds,  the market \nvalue at the time of loan  approval will be the LESSER of the appraised value or the construction \ncost plus the value of the site. \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n8-20 Borrower Acknowledgement \nof Accrued Interest  \n \nIf the borrower is unavailable or \nunwilling  to acknowledge  the revised  loan \namount from the accrued interest during construction, the Loan Originator should proceed with conversion to permanent in \nLoanServ.

    "content": "H \nHB-1-3550  \n9.1 INTRODUCTION  \nThis chapter  describes  the requirements  for processing  loans in several  special  situations.  \nSection 1 discusses conditional commitments. Section 2 deals with processing requirements \nsurrounding condominium ownership, community  land trusts,  and planned unit developments. \nThe chapter concludes with Section 3, which describes the specific processing differences for manufactured homes. \nSECTION  1: CONDITIONAL  COMMITMENTS  [7 CFR 3550.70]  \n9.2 OVERVIEW  OF CONDITIONAL  COMMITMENTS  \nA conditional commitment is a written  assurance  from  the Agency  to a qualified  builder, \ndealer -contractor, or seller that a dwelling to be constructed or rehabilitated will be certified as \nacceptable for purchase by qualified loan applicants, as long as the construction and sales price meet certain conditions. The conditional commitment does not reserve loan funds, nor does it guarantee that an eligible loan applicant will be available to purchase the property. It does, however, provide a reasonable assurance to the builder that the home will be eligible for financing once it is compl eted.  \nIf the area does not remain  rural,  the conditional commitment will not be honored unless \na purchaser is found who applied for a loan before the rural area designation changed. \n9.3 APPLICATION AND FEE  \nBuilders, dealer -contractors, or sellers interested in becoming conditional commitment \ncontractors must apply using Form RD 1944-36, Application for Conditional Commitment. A single application form may be used to request conditional commitments for multiple dwellings. All required attachments mu st be included for each dwelling for which a conditional \ncommitment is requested,  including the proposed selling  price,  address,  evidence of building site \nownership, and detailed descriptions of all proposed construction. \n9-1 \n(01-2 3-03) SPECIAL PN \nRevised (0 5-05-25) PN 640 \nCHAPTER  9: SPECIAL  SITUATIONS"

    "content": "HB-1-3550  \nParagraph  9.3 Application  and Fee \n \nApplicants must include a standard application fee for each dwelling for which a \nconditional commitment is requested. This fee is updated periodically through an Unnumbered \nLetter (UL) posted to the Agency’s Directives  website. The UL will generally be posted 30 days \nprior to the effective date of the fee change. If a preliminary inspection of the property or investigation of the conditional commitment applicant indicates that a conditional commitment will not be issued, the application fee should be refunded. Once the appraisal is conducted, the application  fee cannot be  refunded. When a loan  on a property with a conditional commitment is \nclosed,  the appraisal  fee collected  from  the purchaser is disbursed to the conditional commitment \ncontractor.  \n \n9.4 EVALUATING  THE  CONDITIONAL  COMMITMENT  APPLICATION \n \nAn application  for a conditional commitment is evaluated  based  on the criteria  discussed  \nbelow.   \n• Ownership.  The applicant must have an adequate  ownership interest  in the property, \nas described in Paragraph 5.11  of this Handbook, before beginning construction. \n \n• Capacity. The applicant must have the experience and ability to complete any proposed work  competently  and must be financially  responsible and able to finance or \nobtain financing for any proposed work. The capacity of applicants for conditional commitments should be evaluated in the same manner as for any construction contractor, as discussed in Paragraph 5.25 A\n of this Handbook. \n \n• Legal capacity. The applicant  must have the legal  capacity  to enter  into the required \nagreements. Legal capacity can be verified by checking the applicant’s business license and registration.  \n \n• Civil rights. The applicant must agree to comply with all applicable laws, regulations, and Executive Orders  relating  to civil rights, as described  in Paragraph \n1.9\n of this Handbook. \n \n• Affirmative  marketing.  Any company that receives  5 or more  conditional \ncommitments during a 12-month period must develop an acceptable \nAffirmative  Fair Housing Marketing  Plan,  as described  in RD Instruction  1901- E. \n \n• Site requirements.  The proposed site must meet  the requirements listed  in Section  1 \nof Chapter 5  of this Handbook. \n \n• Dwelling requirements. If the dwelling is to be constructed or substantially \nrehabilitated,  it must meet  the requirements  listed  in Section  2 of Chapter  5 of this \nChapter . If it is a new  manufactured home, it must meet the requirements of \nParagraph 9.19  of this Chapter. \n \n \n \n9-2"

An environmental review  must be completed  as\ndescribed in Section 3 of Chapter 5.\n•Start  of construction.  Conditional commitments  for new or substantially\nrehabilitated dwellings will not be issued after construction has  started.\n•Local market demand. The number of conditional commitments issued in any\nlocality should not exceed existing market demand. In particular, the number of\noutstanding commitments in the area must not exceed the number of loans that canreasonably be expected to be made within 3 months of dwelling completion. To\ndetermine  this, the Loan  Originator should consider the availability  of loan funds and\nthe number of loan applications typically received in the office.\n•Proposed  price.  The proposed price must not exceed  the applicable area loan limit,\nas described in Paragraph 6.6  of this Handbook.\n9.5 PRELIMINARY APPROVAL  \nIn general,  the Loan  Originator  must review  the application  materials  within  7 days of \nreceiving a completed application. Staff is  encouraged to use online resources, such as the \ncounty assessor or taxing authority, to verify property details provided in the conditional commitment application package.  \nA.Ordering  an Appraisal\nIf the document review indicates that all of the requirements outlined in Paragraph 9.4 \nof this Chapter can reasonably be met (except for the site requirements which will be reviewed upon receipt of an appraisal), an appraisal should be ordered in accordance with the guidelines set forth in Paragraph 5.17 of this Handbook. Because the application  fee cannot be refunded \nafter the appraisal  is conducted, the appraisal should never be ordered until the document \nreview is complete.  \nB.Site Approval and Responsibility  for Environmental Reviews\nUpon receipt  of the appraisal,  the Loan  Originator should ensure that construction has not \nbegun and that the site meets the requirements of Section 1 of Chapter 5. In addition, the Loan Originator will initiate an environmental review as discussed in Section 3 of Chapter 5. Unless there are unresolved environmental issues, the Loan Originator must determine within 7 days of receipt of the appraisal, whether the application for a conditional commitment should be accepted or rejected.  \n9-3 \n(01-2 3-03) SPECIAL PN \nRevised (05-0 5-25) PN 640"

Rejecting  the Application  for Conditional  Commitment  \n \nIf any of the requirements outlined in Paragraph 9.4 of this Chapter are not met, the \nLoan Originator must deny the application for a conditional commitment. The documents \nattached to the application  must  be returned  to the applicant,  along with a letter  explaining why \nthe application was not approved. The application, a copy of the supporting documents, and a \ncopy of the rejection letter should be retained in the conditional commitment applicant’s file.  \n \nIf no appraisal  has been  conducted, the letter  should indicate  that the application  fee will \nbe refunded separately. In this case, the Loan Originator should provide the Serving and Asset Management  Office  (Servicing  Office)  with  the information  needed  to send  the refund  check.  If \nthe application was not approved because of the Loan Originator’s assessment of the  \napplicant’s experience or financial capacity, the letter should specify that the applicant has the right to appeal the decision to the National Appeals Division (NAD). \n \n9.6 FINAL  APPROVAL  \n \nThe final decision  about  approving an application  for a conditional  commitment depends \non the results of the appraisal. The proposed selling price listed on the conditional commitment application must not exceed the property’s appraised value or the area loan limit, whichever is \nlower.  \n \nA. Proposed  Price Too High  \n \nIf the proposed selling price exceeds the property’s appraised value, the Loan Originator \nmust  notify the conditional  commitment applicant  that the application  cannot  be approved unless \nthe selling price is reduced. If the conditional commitment applicant decides to reduce the \nproposed price, this decision must be provided to the Loan Originator in writing; the Loan Originator cannot make changes based on verbal instructions. If the conditional commitment applicant elects not to reduce the proposed price, the documents attached to the application should be returned along with a letter explaining why the application was not approved.  \n \nB. Proposed  Price Acceptable \n \nIf all of the eligibility requirements are met and the proposed price is acceptable, a \nconditional commitment can be issued. The Loan Approval Official should complete and sign Form  RD 1944- 11, Conditional  Commitment,  and forward  a copy to the conditional  commitment \napplicant.  \n \n9-4"

At the \nconditional commitment contractor’s request, the Loan Approval Official may extend the \ncommitment period for up to an additional 6 months if there have been unexpected delays in \nconstruction caused by such factors as bad weather, materials shortages, or marketing difficulties.  In order  to document the extension, the Loan  Originator should modify Form  RD \n1944- 11, Conditional Commitment.  \n \nA conditional commitment will be canceled  if construction does not begin within  60 days \nafter the commitment is issued, unless the Loan Approval Official determines that there were unavoidable circumstances that justified the delay. The Agency’s construction inspector, or other qualified inspector as set forth in Section 6 of Chapter 5, should visit the site to verify that construction has begun. If the inspector finds that construction has not begun, the Loan Originator should send a letter to the contractor indicating that the conditiona l commitment has \nbeen canceled and specifying the reasons. \n \n9.8 CHANGES  IN PLANS,  SPECIFICATIONS,  OR COMMITMENT  PRICE  \n \nThe Loan Approval Official may approve changes in project plans, specifications, or \ncommitment price if the conditional commitment contractor  requests  the changes  in writing,  and \nthe conditions discussed below have been met. \n \n• The property  must continue to meet  applicable development  standards after any \nchanges;  \n \n• If a change is requested  after a loan applicant has exercised  an option on the property, \nthe change may be approved only if the loan applicant and the contractor both agree to the changes in writing; \n \n• Any increase in costs  must have been  caused  by factors  beyond the control of the \ncommitment holder, such as an unforeseeable materials shortage; \n \n \n \n    \n \n    \n \n \n9-5 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL  PN \nRevised  (04-27-16) PN 485"

Documents  related  to the establishment and operation of community \nland trusts must be reviewed by the Office of the General Counsel (OGC) to determine whether the Agency’s rights are sufficiently protected. Other forms of ownership  will be  referred to OGC \nwhen the Loan Approval Official determines it necessary to ensure the Agency’s rights are protected.  \n \nWhen a duplex, townhome, condex (or other similar descriptive type of property) \nhas shared  property  or zero lot line beyond the dwelling’s footprint and where the borrower \nowns, typically one -half of a 2 -dwelling unit, the Loan Approval Official must review and \napprove the “association’s ” recorded agreements. The document must indicate the \nmaintenance responsibilities for the structure and any shared walls, roofs, driveways, amenities, utilities, and easements to ensure they are enforceable (as needed) and compel payments from each owner sufficient to ensure that the structure remains in good condition. The document should clearly inform each owner of a unit of their rights, responsibilities, their share of costs , and be legally binding.  A master insurance policy for the building shell \nis required.  If the master policy includes interior property damage coverage (e.g., flooring, cabinets, fixtures) a separate property insurance policy (HO -6 or HO -3) purchased by the \nborrower is not required but is highly rec ommended for protection of their personal \npossessions and furnishings.  \n \n9.13 LOANS  FOR  CONDOMINIUM  UNITS  [7 CFR 3550.71]  \n \nLoans  may be made  to finance  the purchase  of dwellings  in condominium  developments \nif the conditions described in this paragraph are met, and the applicant and the property otherwise meet the requirements outlined in this handbook. \n \nA. Definition  \n \nA condominium  is defined  as a real estate project  in which  each unit owner  has title to a \nunit, an  undivided interest  in the common areas  of the project,  and sometimes  the exclusive  use \nof certain limited common areas. The project may include dwelling units in detached, semi - \ndetached, row, garden- type, low - or high- rise structures.  \n \n \n  \n9-8"

Appreciation is measured by the difference \nbetween the original purchase price and the actual price at which the property is resold.  \n \n• If the program permits  the borrower to sell the property  at market  value but recaptures \npart of the equity, the Agency considers a reasonable share of appreciation to be at least 50 percent. The Agency does not object to situations whereby the borrower’s share of appreciation is on a sliding scale beginning at 0, provided that within 2 years the homeowner would be permitted to retain 50 percent of the appreciation.  \n \n• If the program  sets a maximum sales  price restriction,  the borrower must be permitted \nto retain 100 percent of the appreciation.  \n \n• Other  arrangements  for sharing appreciation  may be approved by the State  Director.  \nD. Right  of First  Refusal  \n \nOne method commonly used to ensure that housing remains  part of an affordable housing \nprogram is for the community land trust to hold a right of first refusal or an option right that can be exercised when the borrower proposes to sell the home to a purchaser not eligible for the program benefits. Such a provision is permitted if all of the requirements listed below are met.  \n \n• The rights must be held only by a governmental body or eligible nonprofit \norganization and exercised  by them  or someone they have identified  as an eligible \npurchaser.  \n \n• Any right must be exercised within 45 days after the holder of these rights may \nexercise them  (for example,  the rights are often  triggered  by a notice of sale from  the \nborrower).  \n \n• Payment Subsidy  Recapture  \nThe borrower’s ability to repay payment subsidies may be affected by the resale restrictions of the community land trust. Upon closing, the lease agreement and/or any other document(s) containing information  about the community  land trust’s  resale \nrestrictions should be sent to the Servicing Office with the other applicable closing documents, to ensure accurate subsidy recapture calculations in the future. \n \n \n \n   \n \n9-15 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL  PN \nRevised  (04-15-21) PN 549"

Appraisals  \n \nA property located on a site owned by a community land trust must be appraised as a \nleasehold  interest,  with thorough analysis  of the ground lease,  and resale and other  restrictions \nwhich may apply.  \n \nBecause the community land trust may subsidize the sales price to a borrower, the sales \nprice may be significantly  less than the market  value  of the leasehold  interest in the property. The \nappraised value of the leasehold interest must be accurately developed by the appraiser because \nthe resale restrictions, as well as other restrictions that may be included in the ground lease, can also affect the value of the property.  \n \nThe appraiser  must  use a three- step process  to develop  an opinion of value.  \n \n• Fee Simple  Value  = Sales  Comparison Analysis  Approach.  \n \nIn determining  the fee simple  value  of the subject  property, the appraiser  must  use \ncomparable  sales  of similar  properties  that are owned  as fee simple  estates.  If this \nis not possible, the appraiser may use sales of properties that are subject to other \ntypes of leasehold estates as long as he or she makes appropriate adjustments, \nbased on the terms of their leases, to reflect a fee simple interest.  \nWhen  the community  or neighborhood has sales  activity  for other  leasehold  estates \nheld by a community land trust, the appraiser must discuss them in the appraisal \nreport, but must not use them as comparable sales because, in all likelihood, the sales prices will have been limited by  restrictions  in the ground lease.  \n \n• Value of Leased  Fee = Ground Rent  / Capitalization  Rate.

    "content": "SECTION  1: UNDERSTANDING  LEVERAGED LOANS  \n10.1 OVERVIEW  \nA leveraged loan is an Agency loan that is supplemented by an affordable housing loan \nor grant from  another funding source that is provided at the same time the Agency  loan is closed. \nOnly eligible leveraged loans will be considered in the payment subsidy calculation. For the \npurpose of payment subsidy only, an eligible leveraged loan is defined as an affordable housing \nloan that is characterized by long term (not less than 30 years), amortized payments with a note \ninterest rate equal to or less than 3 percent. Detailed guidance for calculating payment subsidy is provided in Paragraph 6.12 of this Handbook. This does not preclude other types of participating leveraging.             Leveraging reduces the loan amount the Agency must provide to help an applicant obtain adequate housing. The additional funding source may be a private lender that provides home financing at market  rates  and terms,  a State  or local  government, or a nonprofit organization that \nprovides subsidized loans or grants. Leveraged loan payment, security, and processing requirements may vary from non-leveraged loans as provided in this chapter. This chapter provides basic information about leveraging and describes the modifications to regular loan processing procedures that are made when a loan is to be leveraged.  Exhibits 10-1 and  10-2, of \nthis Chapter, summarize  processing priority, subordination, and payment assistance for different \ntypes of leveraged products. \nA.Advantages of Leveraged  Loans\nLeveraged  loans offer  advantages  to both the Agency and applicants.  By combining its\nresources with those of other lenders, the Agency can assist more borrowers. For this reason,  loan  packages  that receive an  affordable \nhousing loan from  an Agency  recognized  source \nwill receive a processing priority when the supplemental funding reduces the amount otherwise needed from the Agency by at least 20 percent with loan funds or 15 percent if entirely grants, forgivable loans or deferred payment loans. \nFor some applicants, purchasing a home through a leveraged loan will be the first \nopportunity to establish  a relationship  with a private lender.

Leveraging is especially encouraged in the case of \nassumptions  on new  rates and terms,  since the applicant may  be able to obtain a non- Agency \nloan for purchase costs above the outstanding balance to be assumed.  \n \nB. Two  Separate Financial  Agreements  \n \nWhen  a loan  is leveraged,  each  lender  enters  into a separate financial  agreement  with  the \napplicant. The combined resources that are provided enable the applicant to purchase a home.  \nAlthough each lender  remains  responsible  for final underwriting decisions  for its loan, the \napplication and underwriting processes should be streamlined whenever possible to avoid duplication of effort and extra burden on the applicant.  \n \n10.2 SOURCE  OF LEVERAGED  FUNDS  \n \nAgency funds may be supplemented by funds from a variety of sources. One of the \nchallenges  for the Loan  Originator  will be to understand the implications  for the applicant  and \nthe Agency of the requirements that may be imposed by these sources.  \n \nA. Market  Rate  Financing  \n \nMarket rate financing may be appropriate under some circumstances. The applicant’s \nrepayment ability must be considered in determining whether it is appropriate for referral to market  rate sources.  Market  rate loans  will not be considered  in the payment  assistance formula. \nPrivate lenders generally have a variety of loan products that are tailored to fit specific circumstances, for example, different products for new purchases, refinancing, and home improvement loans. The private lender loan must be a long- term, fixed rate mortgage of at least \n30 years or a term no shorter than 15 years with a balloon payment and installment based on at least a 30 -year amortization sch edule. The Agency will not accept an adjusted rate mortgage \n(ARM) or an interest only mortgage. The Agency will not participate in loan packages that involve  interest  rates  that are more  than 2% (200 basis  points)  above  the Agency  note rate. Loan \nOriginato rs may need to work with the lender and applicant to identify an appropriate loan \nproduct that meets lender and Agency requirements. \nB. Affordable Housing Loans  \nIn many areas, low -interest loans are offered by State and local government agencies. \nThese loans require repayment on a monthly basis and may include provisions for the funding source to share in any appreciation.  \n \n \n   \n_______________________________________________________________________________  \n10-2"

Other Subsidized Financing  \n \nAlthough there are many  variations in the specifics,  the subsidized funds that can \nsupplement Agency funds will generally come in one of the forms described below. \n \n• Grants without long -term restrictions. Some grants are provided with no \nrestrictions,  as long as  the applicant  is eligible,  and the funds will be used for \nan eligible purpose. \n \n• Forgivable loans. Some sources provide funds that require repayment only if the \nhome buyer fails to comply with program requirements or restrictions. For example, a funding source may provide funds for a down payment or rehabilitation that need not be repaid  if the home buyer remains  in the property  for a specified  period  of time. \nThe funds are generally  provided as a loan to permit  the funding agency  to record  the \ncircumstances under which repayment is required. \n• Deferred  payment loans. Deferred  payment loans  may be used to provide funds that \nare repaid only upon transfer of the property or as a balloon payment at the end of a specified period. These funding arrangements often include a provision for the funding source to share any appreciation that occurs with the home buyer. \n \nGrants, forgivable loans, deferred payment loans, and any other non-amortizing loans \nare not considered in calculating  the monthly principal, interest,  taxes,  and insurance (PITI) or \ntotal debt (TD) ratios. The Agency’s ability to recapture subsidy funds may be affected by the provisions of these loans. While an applicant may obtain a loan from another source of less than \n20 percent of the total transaction, such a loan would not  receive benefits such as lien priority, \nor processing priority. Further, USDA payment assistance is used to make the home affordable \nrather than to make the participating financing  affordable.  \n \n10.3 KEY  DIFFERENCES  IN POLICIES  AND PROCEDURES  \n \nThis paragraph  highlights major  policy and procedural differences  between  qualifying \nleveraged loans and other participation loans. Detailed processing guidance for originating leveraged loans is provided in Section 2 of this chapter. \n \nA. Eligible  Loans and Grants  \n \nCash contributions by the applicant, gifts from individuals, and donations of land do not \ncount as leveraged or participation amounts. These are applicant contributions. Likewise, seller contributions or assistance from organizations that require seller pa rticipation or seller \ncontributions do not count towards leveraged  or participation  amounts. Subsequent loans cannot \nbe leveraged unless they are used in conjunction with assumptions on new rates and terms. \n \n \n \n10-3 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL  PN \nRevised  (11-06-24) PN 628"

    "content": "HB-1-3550  \nParagraph  10.3 Key Differences  in Policies  and Procedures   \n  \nThe Agency will not consider leveraging arrangements with market -rate financing \nsources in which the lender’s loan amount is less than 20 percent or greater than 50 percent of \nthe combined transaction amount. When all the leveraging consists of subsidized financing (affordable  housing products, such as down payment  assistance except  funds  that come directly \nor indirectly from seller contributions, forgivable loans, etc.), the minimum acceptable leveraging is 15 percent.  \n \nOther financing totaling less than 20 percent from  lenders , or 15 percent from other \nsubsidized housing assistance,  is permissible.    \n \nB. Lien  Position  \n \nTo encourage participation  by other  lenders,  the Agency  will only subordinate  its lien \nposition to a leveraged lender providing at least 20 percent , but no more than 50 percent , of the \nfinancing.  \n \nLiens related to other subsidized funds provided in the form of grants and non-\namortizing loans, such as deferred payment or forgivable loan, must be subordinated to the Agency's loan. In those cases where there is a soft, silent or forgivable lien, the total debt may exceed the market value as prescribed in Paragraph 6.7 F  of this Chapter . \n \nC. Payment  Subsidy  Calculation  \n \nRegardless of the percentage of the \nloan that is financed by the leveraged lender, the monthly note installment of an eligible leveraged  loan as described  in paragraph  10.1, \nwill be considered in the payment subsidy calculations. Detailed guidance for  \ncalculating payment subsidy is provided in Paragraph 6.12 of this Chapter . \n \nD. Availability  of Mortgage  Credit  Certificates  (MCC)  \n \nUnder  current  tax law some  State  and local  issuers of  mortgage  bonds  may  issue  a MCC \nto provide  a Federal  income  tax credit  to assist  low-income  home  buyers  and home  owners. The \ncredit  permits  an eligible  household to  claim  a specific  percentage of  the annual  interest  paid  on \na mortgage as a tax credit rather than a deduction. If an applicant will receive the credit, the benefit  of the credit  will be “grossed  up” according  to income  calculation  guidance  described  in \nChapter 4 , Paragraph 4.4 H  of this Handbook. MCCs are typically issued by Housing Finance \nAgencies through private lenders. The maximum annual MCC tax credit is limited by the IRS Tax Code (currently  $2,000).  The tax credit is not considered leveraging.  \n \n \n \n \n10-4 Will the leveraged  loan payment  be considered \nwhen calculating payment subsidy?  \nOnly  when  the eligible  leveraged  loan is amortized  for \nat least 30 years with an interest rate that does not \nexceed 3 percent.  \nExhibit  6-2 provides  a sample  payment  subsidy \ncalculation."

Section  8 Housing  Choice  Vouchers  (HCV)  \n \nHousing Choice Vouchers may be used with or without a leveraged  loan. The voucher \nitself is not considered leveraging. \n \nF. Origination  \n \nMany  processing steps  can be conducted by the participating  lender,  rather  than  Agency \nstaff.  For example,  the Agency  may  accept  application  and income information  provided by the \nlender  and permit the participating  lender  to conduct appraisals  and inspections when  the lender \nhas a stake in the transaction. However, even when the Agency relies on the work of the \nparticipating lender, it retains internal control, final underwriting, and loan approval responsibility for the Agency loan. Responsibility for compliance with environmental requirements remains with the Agency, although the lender may be asked to assist in collecting \nneeded environmental information. The Agency is also responsible for compliance with the \ndisclosure requirements under the Truth in Lending Act and Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act Integrated Mortgage Disclosures (TRID) regulation for the Agency loan. Section 2 of this chapter provides detailed processing guidance for originating leveraged loans. \nG. Servicing  \n \nLeveraged  loans are  eligible  for the same servicing  actions  as any other Section  502 loan. \nIt is imperative that any leveraging arrangement be structured so that applicant rights are preserved.  However,  servicing  strategies  may be different  because of the Agency's lien position \nand the need to coordinate servicing strategies with the participating lender.  \n \n1. Tax Service Fee (Tax  and Insurance  Escrow)  \n \nThe Agency will collect a tax service fee on all leveraged loans. Either the \nparticipating  lender  with at least 20 percent  of the total amortized  loan amount or the \nAgency may maintain the escrow account. Lenders with less than 20 percent and all \naffordable housing product agencies may not maintain the escrow account. When \nnecessary, the Agency may make advances to pay taxes or insurance premiums.  \nThe Agency is customarily in a subordinate lien position with the largest portion of \nthe loan amortized for the longer term and is at more risk than the other lender. An \nexception  to this may be agreed  to with the prior lien holder when  the tax service vendor \n \n \n \n__________________________________________________________________________________  \n10-5 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL PN  \nReviewed ( 11-06-24) PN 628"

Special  Servicing  \n \nThe Agency  will aggressively  pursue  all available  special  servicing  remedies  to help \nsolve applicant problems. If foreclosure is necessary, each lender has an independent responsibility  to protect  its interest.  When the Agency is in a subordinate lien position to \nthe leveraged lender, Form  RD 1927- 8, Agreement  with Prior Lienholder must be \nexecuted and recorded in the appropriate Real Estate Mortgage Records .  The agreement  \nrequires the participating lender to notify the Agency before accelerating any loan and permits, but does not require, the Agency to pay or reinstate the prior lien to protect the Agenc y's interest. \n10.4 DEVELOPING STATE -BY-STATE APPROACHES  TO \nLEVERAGING  \nThe way in which  leveraging is most  effectively  handled will vary state-to-state and \ncommunity -to-community, depending upon  \nmarket conditions, the availability of Government  subsidy funds, and the interest  of \nprivate lenders. For this reason, each State \nDirector should develop an independent \nleveraging strategy that will encourage and facilitate the use of leveraged loans.  \n \nA. Lender Outreach  \n \nEach  state should implement lender  outreach  activities  that encourage  participation  by all \nprospective lenders. For example, Field Staff should:  \n \n• Collect  and maintain  sales  information  for each market  area that will enable the Loan \nOriginator to assess whether applicants are candidates for 100 percent private financing or for leveraging. \n \n• Identify  lenders  who are active in the State  and provide  information  about  the \nAgency's loan programs and how leveraging arrangements might  work. \n \n     \n__________________________________________________________________________________  \n10-6Elements  of an Effective  Lending  Strategy  \n• Lender  Outreach  and Marketing  \n• Effective  Borrower Education \n• Streamlined  Processing  Procedures"

Participating  \nlender  credit  requirements  may be more  stringent  than the Agency’s, but the Loan  Originator  can \nencourage lenders to work with applicants who meet Agency requirements. In talking with the participating lender, the Loan Originator should stress that the Agency will be sharing risk with \nthe participating lender and that the participating lender will hold the first lien position.  Also, \nthe lender may receive CRA credit for making loans in partnership with the Agency.

Property  Requirements  and Appraisal  \n \nThe property must meet all of the requirements described in Chapter 5. The Loan \nOriginator may accept property inspections and appraisals conducted by the participating lender, \nas long as evidence of the qualifications  of the individuals  performing  these  activities  is provided \nand accepted. The Loan Originator must still inspect the property to determine eligibility. An \nadministrative review of the appraisal must be completed before the appraisal is accepted. The \nenvironmental review remains the responsibility of the Agency; however, the participating \nlender may be requested to provide environmental information. \n \nC. Loan -to-Value  Ratio  \n \nWhen loans are funded solely by the Agency, the applicant’s total debt may exceed the \nmarket value of the property by the total of the Agency appraisal and tax monitoring fees, the required  contribution to establish  the escrow  account,  plus the fee for homeownership education. \nDown payments are required only if the nonelderly households cash value of non- retirement \nassets exceed  thresholds specified in Paragraph 4.6  of this Handbook.)  \n \nSome lenders may be willing to participate in a loan when the total debt exceeds the \nvalue of the property because their risk is limited by the Agency's participation in the loan. However, others will require that applicants have some equity in the propert y, because they \nbelieve an  investment  in the property improves  the likelihood that the applicants  will fulfill their \ncommitments. This means that applicants with leveraged loans may need to contribute more cash than other applicants. The Loan Originator should explain to the applicant whether a cash contribution will be necessary  and work  with the lender  to lower  their usual  equity requirements.  \n \nD. Loan  Terms  and Fees \n \nLenders  are expected  to charge  reasonable  and customary  interest  rates  and fees.

    "content": "HB-1-3550 \n \n \n11.1 INTRODUCTION  \n \nA nonprogram loan is an extension of credit to a borrower who does not qualify for \nprogram credit, or an extension of credit to allow a buyer to purchase a property that does not \nqualify as a program property.  The Agency will make nonprogram loans to:  \n \n• Allow the assumption of an existing program loan on new rates and terms;  or \n• Expedite the sale of a Real Estate Owned (REO) property.  \nUnless otherwise specified in this chapter, nonprogram loan applications should be \naccepted, evaluated, and closed following the procedures described for Section 502 loans in Chapters 2 through 10. For a summary of the differences between program and nonprogram loans, see Attachment 11 -A. \n \nA. Nonprogram  Assumptions  \n \nWhen an existing Agency borrower \nwishes to sell a security property, the Agency will assist that borrower by allowing any creditworthy buyer to assume the outstanding Section 502 debt, even if the purchaser is not eligible for a program loan or the property does  \nnot qualify as a program property. This helps the borrower sell the property and reduce the chances that the borrower will default without requiring the Agency to obligate new funds. The amount assumed is reamortized over a full new loan period.  \n \nB. Nonprogram Loans to Purchase REO Property  \n \nWhen the Agency has REO property to dispose of and funding is available, credit may be \nextended on nonprogram terms in order to facilitate the sale of the prope rty. Field Staff should \nconsult with the State Office to ensure that funds for nonprogram REO sales are available before offering credit. Nonprogram credit may only be offered after the expiration of any restriction \nperiod on program properties.  Chapter 16 provides additional guidance on REO sales. \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n11-1 \n(01-23-03)  SPECIAL PN  \nRevised ( 03-09-22) SPECIAL PN  \nCHAPTER 11: NONPROGRAM LOANS [7 CFR 3550.74]  \nSame Rate and Terms Assumptions  \nIn certain cases, generally those involving \ntransfers of title between family members, a loan \nmay be assumed under the same rates and terms by \nsomeone who is not program -eligible.

    "content": "HB-1-3550 \n \n11.2 PRE- QUALIFICATION \n \nThe pre -qualification step is substantially the same as for program loans, as described in \nSection 1 of Chapter 3. When a potential applicant expresses interest in nonprogram credit, the \nLoan Originator explains the Agency’s nonprogram requirements and uses UniFi to determine \nwhether the potential applicant has adequate repayment ability. Although the potent ial applicant \nmay submit an application regardless of the outcome of the pre -qualification, this step can save \nthe applicant and Agency staff time in the long run by letting potential applicants know in advance about any reasons they may not be eligible for a nonprogram loan.  \n \n11.3 APPLICATION PROCESSING  \n \nThis step is substantially similar to the process for a program loan described in Section 2 \nof Chapter 3. The nonprogram applicant must submit Form RD 410- 4, Uniform Residential \nLoan Application. The Loan Origi nator then determines whether the application is complete, \nasks follow up questions needed to understand the applicant’s situation, and conducts a preliminary credit check, as described in Paragraph 4.11. The Loan Originator then makes a preliminary eligib ility determination and notifies the applicant.  \n \nUnlike applicants for program loans, applicants for nonprogram credit must submit a \nnonrefundable $100 application fee. However, this fee cannot be collected prior to issuing the \nLoan Estimate to nonprogram applicants, in accordance with Paragraph 3. 8. The application fee \nis waived for applicants who are public bodies or nonprofit organizations.  \n \n11.4 ELIGIBILITY  \n \nNonprogram applicants are not subject to the income eligibility, asset, citizenship, or \noccupancy requirements described in Chapter 4 for program borrowers. They may own other \nproperties and are not required to first seek private sources of financing. However, they must \ncomply with other requirements found in Section 4 of Chapter 4 relating t o legal capacity, \ntruthful applications, and suspension or debarment, and must meet the credit requirements \noutlined in Section 3 of Chapter 4.  \n \n11.5 PROPERTY REQUIREMENTS  \n \nProperties financed with nonprogram loans are not required to meet the site and dwelling \nrequirements described in Sections 1 and 2 of Chapter 5, but are required to meet the environmental requirements described in Section 3 of Chapter 5.  Chapter 16 describes \ndisclosure and documentation requirements for REO properties being disposed of that  are not \ndecent, safe, and sanitary or that may contain hazards.  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n11-2"

Down Payment  Requirement  \n \nNonprofit organizations and State and local governments are not required to contribute a \ndown payment.  Other nonprogram applicants are required to make a down payment.  \nNonprogram borrowers who intend to occupy the property must contribute 2 percent of the \npurchase price. Nonprogram borrowers who do not intend to occupy the property must \ncontribute  5 percent of the purchase price.  \n \nB. Amount to be  Financed \n \nFor assumptions, Agency credit is limited to the lesser of the sales price or the amount of \nthe existing borrower’s outstanding debt, less the purchaser’s down payment. If the purchaser \nrequires add itional funds to purchase the property, the funds must come from another source.  \n \nFor REO sales, Agency credit is limited to the sales price, less the purchaser’s down \npayment. Closing costs and fees, tax service fees, and any required initial deposit to t he escrow \naccount cannot be financed. \n \nC. Interest Rate  \n \nThe interest rate charged for nonprogram loans is the nonprogram rate in \neffect at the time of loan approval. Nonprogram rates can be found in Exhibit B of \nRD Instruction 440.1. \n \nD. Loan Repayment Period  \n \nThe repayment period for nonprogram loans depends on whether the applicant intends to \npersonally occupy the property.  \n \nFor nonprogram applicants who intend to personally occupy the property, the maximum \nloan term is 30 years. If an applicant alread y has a nonprogram loan, a new 30- year loan is not \npermitted, even if the applicant intends to occupy the new property.  \n \nFor nonprogram applicants who do not intend to personally occupy the property, the \nmaximum loan term is 10 years.

Loan  funds are available \nfor repairs to improve or modernize a home, make it safer or more sanitary, or remove health and \nsafety hazards.  For homeowners that are 62 years  of age and old er, grant funds are available to \nremove health or safety hazards, or remodel dwellings to make them accessible to a household member with a disability.   Attachment  12-A, of this Chapter, provides a summary  of the differences  \nbetween  Section  504 loans and Section  504 grants, Attachment 12 -B, of this Chapter, provides the \ndifferences between Section 502 and Section 504 loans, Attachment  12-C provides a processing and \nclosing checklist , Attachment  12-D, of this Chapter, provides a checklist for assessment of an existing \ndwelling , Attachment 12 -E provides items included with a complete application , and Attachment 12 -\nF, of this Chapter, provides a pre-construction checklist. \nThe procedures that differ from  Section  502 loans are  described  in this chapter.  \nUnless otherwise specified in this chapter, Section 504 loan/grant applications should be accepted, evaluated, and closed following the same procedures described for Section 502 loans in Chapters 2 through 10 of this Handbook.\n However, Section 504 loans cannot be assumed \nexcept on Same Rates  and Terms  as described  in Chapter 2 Paragraph  2.4 B of this Handbook.  \nIn addition, a property  survey  is not required for a Section 504 loan or grant unless a mortgage \nor deed of trust is being filed and there is a compelling reason  to question the placement  of the \ndwelling  on the property; or, in farm  acreage cases, where the house site is subdivided from a \nlarger parcel.  The cost of a survey can be included in the loan if there is sufficient equity. \n12.2 ELIGIBLE PURPOSES  FOR  504 FUNDS  [7 CFR  3550.102]  \nSection 504 loan funds may be used to make general repairs to improve or modernize the \nproperty (including a new addition to an existing home), as long as the dwelling remains modest. Loan Originators may approve any of the eligible costs listed in Chapter 6 Paragraph 6.4 of this Handbook, unless specifically prohibited in 7 CFR  3550 and this chapter.  In limited  circumstances,  \nfunds may be used to refinance an Agency loan as a special servicing action (subject to the \navailability of funds and Agency priorities) such as at the end of a moratorium. Directives will be provided for usage of this option as Agency priorities are determined. \nSection 504 grant funds may be used only for repairs and improvements that will remove \nhealth  and safety  hazards,  or to repair  or remodel  dwellings  to make them  accessible and useable  for a \nhousehold member with a disability.

Consider the following unreimbursed ongoing/projected medical  expenses;  Medicare \npremiums,  supplemental insurance, long- term care insurance, prescription drug coverage, \npharmacy expenses, co - payments, eyewear,  hearing aid / batteries,  exams,  monthly payments for \nmedical  bills,  disability expenses, in home care expenses,  dental  expenses,  including the greater  of \nthe actual  travel  costs for medical  appointments or the published Internal  Revenue Service  \nmileage  rate. You may not deduct funeral or burial expenses, nonprescription medicines, \ntoothpaste, toiletries, cosmetics, a trip, or program for the general improvement of your health, or most cosmetic surgery. Additional guidance on eligible  medical  expenses  can be located  on the Internal Revenue Service \nwebsite.  \nB.Credit  Requirements\nApplicants receiving grant only funding do not need a credit history evaluation.  An\napplicant  with an outstanding judgment obtained by the United  States  in a Federal  court, other \nthan in the United States Tax Court, is not eligible for a Section 504 grant or 504 loan. \nFor loans, applicants must have a credit history that indicates a reasonable ability and \nw\nillingness to meet debt obligations.  Applicants with a credit score of 620 or higher, do not \nrequire  Form  RD 1944-61, “ Credit  History  Worksheet, ” or further evaluation.  These \napplicants are considered to have acceptable  credit  histories,  with the exception  for loan \napplicant(s)  with a significant delinquency described in Chapter 4 Paragraph 4.12 A, of this \nHandbook, or delinquency of a federal debt. \nFor loans, to assist the Agency with verifying a non-purchasing spouse’s obligations in \nc\nommunity property states, the applicant’s non-purchasing spouse must provide a credit report \nor reports from each of the three nationwide consumer credit companies – Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion as described in HB-1-3550, Chapter 4 Paragraph 4.12 D of this Handbook. \nCommunity property states include: Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New \nMexico, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin.  Puerto Rico allows property to be owned as community property as do several Indian jurisdictions.  Alaska is an opt-in community property state, where property is separate unless both parties agree to make it community property through a community property agreement or community property trust.  As laws vary from state to state, Loan Originators should contact the appropriate Office of General Counsel with questions regarding the consideration of a non-purchasing spouse’s credit history. \n_________\n___________________________________________________________________________ \n12-5\n(01-2 3-03) SPECIAL PN \nRevised (05-0 5-25) PN 640"

An applicant with  a \ncredit score less than 620 must demonstrate a history of reliable traditional or non- traditional \ncredit using Form RD 1944-61, “Credit History Worksheet” to conduct the credit analysis. \nThe indicators of unacceptable credit  described  in Chapter 4 Exhibit 4-4, of this \nHandbook, for Section  502 loans can  be used to evaluate the applicant’s  credit  history; \nhowever, general  credit  requirements may be less stringent than those for Section 502 \nloans.  Late payments for housing costs should not be considered as an indicator of \nunacceptable credit.  \nThe Loan  Originator  will check  Department  of Treasury’s  Do Not Pay (DNP)  portal, as \ndescribed in  Chapter 4 Paragraph 4.11 of this Handbook for loan and grant requests. Infile \ncredit reports will be required for applicant(s) receiving a 504 loan assistance. A Tri -Merge \nCredit Report (TMCR) is required for all applications for loans of $7,500 or greater, but the \ncost of the report is not charged to the applicant.  A TMCR is not required to deny a loan request of less than $7,500. \n \nC. Asset  Requirements  \n \nAsset  requirements  are identical  to those imposed by Section  502, except  only assets  that \ncan be converted to cash in 60 days or less are included in the calculation of non- retirement \nassets.  Non-retirement assets  in excess of $15,000 (or $20,000 for an elderly household), must \nbe used to reduce the Section 504 request. \nAn applicant’s  home equity should not be considered in the asset calculation and should \nnot be used as a test for other credit.  \n \nD. Repayment  Ability  \n \nTo qualify for a Section 504 loan, the applicant must have a reliable income source \nsufficient to allow repayment of the loan as supported by a budget.  A budget is defined by \nusing a maximum Total  Debt  (TD)  ratio of 41%. Non-taxable income  is not “grossed  up” for \nthe Section 504 program.  \n \nE. Age for Section  504 Grants  \nAt least one qualified applicant must be 62 or older for a household to receive grant \nassistance.   A qualified  applicant  with an eligible  grant purpose may receive grant funds first \n(up to the lifetime limit).   If grant funds are not enough to cover the needed repairs, the \napplicant’s loan repayment ability will be calculated (see Paragraph 12.5 D of this Chapter ). \nF. Ownership  of Property   \n \nThe applicant  must own and occupy the property  to be eligible  for Section  504 funds, and \nmust be able to document ownership, as described in Chapter 5 Paragraph 5.11 of this Handbook, with 3 exceptions: \nLeasehold  Interest: For Section  504 loans, the property must be covered  by a lease with \nan unexpired portion of not less than 2 years beyond the term of the promissory note, and for grants, the remaining lease period must be at least 5 years. \n \n \n12-6"

Determining  Property  Value   \nThe Loan Approval Official will determine whether an appraisal is needed to assure \nadequate  security  exists  for the  proposed loan.  An appraisal  is never required for an \nunsecured loan.  An appraisal is  required  when  the sum  of all secured  (RD or non- RD) \nindebtedness, including the proposed repair loan, exceeds $25,000. Section 504 applicants \nare required to pay an appraisal fee if an appraisal is deemed necessary.  The cost of the \nappraisal  fee is described  in Chapter 5 Paragraph  5.20 of this Handbook and may be included \nin the 504 loan amount. \nIf an appraisal  is not required,  the value  and the method used to develop the estimate \nshould be documented in the running record.  Utilization of tax assessments, and real estate websites such as Zillow.com, Trulia.com and Realtor.com may be considered as a tool to estimate the value of security.  Appraisals are required when issuing an adverse \naction based on inadequate value of security.  \nC. Construction  Standards   \nDwellings repaired with Section 504 loan or grant funds must remain modest and all \nwork  must  be completed  in accordance with local  codes  and standards.

Typically, the repairs, \nimprovements, or minor rehabilitation (work) discussed within this section would be able to be \ncompleted within 30 days of it commencing.  If work will take more than 30 days, the loan must \nbe processed and coded as ‘construction’ (e.g., interest deferral period and subsequent conversion \nto a permanent loan).  \nA. Communicating  the Standards  \nIt is the applicant’s  responsibility  to be aware of  the standards  the local  jurisdiction  has in \nplace for repairs or improvements to their home before the design or estimate  process progresses.  \nContractors should be provided with a scope of work by the applicant to ensure that the repair \nestimates  for labor  and materials  are consistent  with the homeowners’  expectations.

The purpose of the conference is to ensure that each party  \nunderstands their respective roles and responsibilities.  The parties should review the contract or \naccepted contractors estimate /proposal, start date, estimated  completion  date,  requirements,  and \nspecifications  to ensure all parties  understand the scope of work, construction/thermal standards, \nenvironmental mitigation requirements, fees, materials,  inspection requirements, change orders, \nresponsibilities for access, cleanup, and payment procedures. Along with  the RD  Representative,  the \napplicant/owner and  the contractor  should sign Attachment  12-F of this Chapter.  Alternatively,  the \napplicant/owner and the contractor can acknowledge the pre-construction conference  via an email  \nexchange that includes the completed Attachment 12 -F of this Chapter with the RD Representative’s \nsignature. \nD. Construction  Contract\nWritten contracts using Form RD 1924-6, “Construction Contract” are strongly\nrecommended  for all rehabilitation -related  construction and are required  if the contract or \nestimate will be greater than $10,000 and when construction work will affect the dwelling’s \nstructural integrity (widening doorways, removing walls, foundation work, termite/water \ndamage, etc.).  A contract or estimate  not exceeding $10,000 may use Form RD 1924-6, \n“Construction Contract,” but it is not required.  Contractors commonly have esti mate  \nacceptance language at the bottom of their estimate  proposals, regardless the homeowner’s \nsignature is required as it binds the agreement (contract).  The applicant and contractor must \nsign the contract(s) or estimate /proposal no later than the pre- construction conference.  If there \nare multiple contracts or estimate s and when utilizing the Borrower Method, Form RD 1924-1, \n“Development Plan ” with cost estimates and estimate  specifications must be used.

The inspection(s) may \nbe conducted on -site by Agency staff utilizing Form RD 1924- 12, “ Inspection Report ”, or by \nalternative methods provided by the contractor or homeowner such as photos/videos showing the \ncompleted  work.

The second is multiple advances \nfor work in place in accordance with HB 1- 3550, Chapter 5 Paragraph 5.26 C  of this \nHandbook.  Multiple advances are used  to pay the contractor  for work  completed  and \ncalculated  not to exceed  60%  of the value of work in place for that portion of the contract \n(i.e., contract $10,000, 25% of work completed, calculated as: 0.25 x $10,000 x 0.60 = \n$1,500 payment).  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n_________________________________________________________________________________  \n12-14"

Borrower Method  [RD Instruction  1924- A, 1924.6 (b)]\nBorrower method can be used when the construction method is not feasible, and the \nborrower demonstrates the capacity and experience to oversee the construction process.  This \nmethod increases  Agency  risk and provides the least amount of coverage to the borrower.  If this \nmethod is utilized, the total development of rehabilitation and repairs cannot exceed $5,000.  A \ndetailed estimate of labor and materials should be obtained in writing, with the exception for \namounts less than $100.  The Agency has two payment options: \n•Checks  can be made payable directly  to the laborer(s)  and/or supplier(s) to purchase\nlabor, equipment and materials, or\n•Checks can be issued to the owner, if the owner has paid for labor/material out ofpocket, provides receipts/invoices to document the amount paid, and has obtainedsignatures of the workers  who performed  labor  on Form  RD 1924-11, “Statement  of\nLabor Performed”.\n______________________________________________________________________________ \n12-15\n(01-2 3-03) SPECIAL PN \nRevised (05-0 5-25) PN 640"

The homeowner  is party  to the \ncontract and therefore responsible to countersign the check and release it to the contractor as \npayment. Before payment occurs, the Loan Originator ensures that the work has been accepted \nby the homeowner.  If construction or rehabilitation work cannot be completed because the \ncontractor is unable or unwilling to do so, and a new contractor is not identified by the homeowner  within  30 days, loan funds  will be applied  to reduce the borrower’s  principal  balance. \nGrant funds will be returned to the  Servicing and Asset Management Office (Servicing Office).  \nThe homeowner  must  be notified  of this action  in writing.  \nIf the homeowner  refuses  to pay the contractor  due to a dispute  or unsatisfactory \nworkmanship, the undisbursed funds will be processed in the following manner:  \n• If litigation  is pending,  the Agency  will consult  with the Office  of the General \nCounsel prior to disbursing or returning funds.  \n \n• If litigation is not pending, the Agency will return remaining funds to be applied to the borrower’s loan or grant amount.\n Once funds have been disbursed or returned (and \ndeobligated, as applicable) , loans must be converted to permanent accounts on the first \nof the following month.  The homeowner  should also be advised  of their contractual  \nobligations and may wish  to seek their own legal counsel. \n \n \n    \n  \n__________________________________________________________________________________________________________ \n12-16"

Funds  Remaining  After  Completion  [RD Instruction  1951- A, 1951.11(b)(3)]  \nFunds remaining after completion of \nconstruction and disbursement payment to the \ncontractor, may either be returned as unused funds or used toward an eligible repair.\n Loan funds returned \nwill be curtailed to principal.   For construction loans, \nreturn ed funds must  be de- obligated prior to loan \nconversion.  However, if a borrower received a \ncombination loan and grant, the remaining funds will first be returned to reduce the grant amount. A  notice  \ninforming the borrower  of their right  to appeal must be \nissued within 10 days of the determination to return \nunused funds.\n The remaining funds must be returned \nwithin 90 days. \nB. Disbursement  [DLOS  Manual  Chapter  8] \nLoans and grants can be disbursed utilizing either multiple draws or single check \ndisbursement  (lump -sum payment)  function in LoanServ.  For rehabilitation  projects  exceeding  30 \ndays and those requiring multiple draws the purpose code on the registration screen in UniFi must \nbe coded  40 (construction loan).  This code  will transfer to the new loan screen  in LoanServ  which \nshould reflect a close code of “5” and must be verified at loan closing.  When ordering multiple \ndraws  for loan-grant  combinations, additional  draws  on the grant  portion cannot  be performed  once \nthe loan has been fully disbursed.  \nLoan funds will typically be disbursed before grant funds; however, this may not always be \nfeasible as grant funds are disbursed to remove safety and health hazards or make the dwelling accessible for household members  with a disability.\n Funds  remaining  after completion  of work  should \nalways be returned to reduce the grant balance first when feasible.  \nIn some  instances,  a supervised bank account  may be necessary  for multiple  disbursements.  \nPlease refer to RD Instruction  1902- A for Supervised Bank  Accounts  (SBA) requirements.  The \nWashington, D.C.  based  AgFed  Credit  Union is  equipped to  establish  SBAs  virtually  nationwide.  \nC. Cancellation  of Funds  \nPartial or full cancellation of loan and grant funds can be performed in accordance with \nDLOS Manual Chapter 8.   If a Treasury Check is held by the Agency, it must be voided and \nreturned  to Servicing  Office with form  RD 3550- 17, “Funds  Transmittal Report”.   The following \nreason codes may be used on the Funds Transmittal Report: \n05 Cancellation  of Treasury  Funds  (loan  or grant)  \n20 Principal  Curtailment  \n \n \n12-17 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL PN  \nRevised ( 11-06-24) PN 628 \n Example  - Joe Smith  receives  \n$6,000 in combination loan and \ngrant assistance ($2,000 loan \nand $4,000 grant funds). The repairs are completed and invoiced at only $4,000, less than the original  contract  price. \nThe remaining $2,000 will be returned as unused funds to reduce the grant (not the loan)."

Servicing  is mostly  the role of the Servicing \nOffice; however, Field Staff participation is important to maintain quality customer service and to protect the Government’s interest. \n \nWhenever  local  assistance  is needed  to support  a Servicing  Office  servicing action,  the \nServicing Office will request Field Staff support through the LoanServ work queue or via phone. These requests  will provide  direction  about  the work  to be accomplished.  Appendix 13 \ncontains  a Field  Office  Reference Guide  with  helpful  information  on working effectively  with \nthe Servicing Office.  \n \nSeveral  servicing  functions  have  been  permanently  assigned  to Field  Staff.  These include \ncertain borrower actions requiring approval, assessing the borrower’s ability to refinance with private credit, managing Real Estate Owned (REO) and custodial property, the disposition of REO property, and providing satisfactions when loans are paid off. Borrower actions requiring approval and loan satisfactions are discussed in this chapter. The remaining functions are described in detail in the chapters that follow.  \n \nSection  1 of this chapter  describes  servicing  actions  in which  the Servicing  Office  may \nrequest assistance from Field Staff. This servicing action is the responsibility of the Servicing Office; however, assistance may be needed from the Field so that the Servicing Office can adequately service the loan.  \n \nSection 2 deals with servicing actions which are the responsibility of Field Staff with \nField  Staff  making the final decision. Section  3 involves  liquidation  responsibilities  after the \nServicing Office accelerates a loan.  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n13-1 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL  PN \nRevised  (03-09-22) SPECIAL PN\n \nCHAPTER  13: SERVICING  AND  LIQUIDATION \nFUNCTIONS"

After loan closing, those borrowers must make the \ntransition  to dealing  with the Servicing  Office.  Field  Staff  can help borrowers  with this transition \nby discussing the post -closing role of the Servicing Office with the applicant throughout the \norigination process,  and emphasizing, during the  applicant  orientation, the importance  of dealing \ndirectly with the Servicing Office. Once the loan is closed, the Servicing Office will contact the borrower in writing before the first billing statement to explain its role as servicer.  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n13-2"

Newly -Activated  Borrower  Account  \n \nWhen the Servicing Office receives a new borrower’s loan docket, it will be reviewed to \nensure that the documents are correct, and that the information contained in the legal documents \nmatches the information that has been entered into LoanServ. \nThis will provide a check on the accuracy of all data entry, as well as offering an \nopportunity to identify  and correct clerical errors  that could otherwise result in unauthorized \nassistance.  When  the Servicing  Office  encounters  apparent  discrepancies,  Field  Staff  may be \nasked to assist in correcting problems. \n \nB. Payments  \nField  Staff  should help  borrowers  understand the importance of dealing  directly  with  the \nServicing Office, while still providing appropriate levels of assistance. If a borrower brings a payment to the Field Office, Field Staff should remind the borrower that payments must be sent to the lockbox. Field Staff can forward a payment to the lockbox on the borrower’s behalf; however, the borrower should be advised  that bringing the payment to the Field  Office  will only \ndelay arrival at the correct destination, and the borrower will be m ore likely to incur a late fee \nthan if the payment is sent directly. Late fees are set at 4 percent of the borrower’s scheduled payment for principal and interest and are assessed if the scheduled payment is more than 15 day s \npast due. \nFees on payments accepted by the Field Office will be recorded on Form RD 1951-49, \n“Register of Collections,” and will be safeguarded in accordance with RD Instruction 1951- B \nand Form  RD 1951-44, “Management  Control and Review  of Field  Office  Collection  Activities, \nand related Forms Manual Insert.  \nC. Approval Actions  \nThe Servicing Office must approve a variety of actions borrowers may wish to take \nduring the course of their loans, including leasing mineral rights, obtaining a partial release of security,  transferring  title to someone who will assume the indebtedness, and obtaining Agency \nconsent to temporarily not occupy the property or subordinate the Agency loan. In some circumstances, these actions may require on -site expertise.  \n \n \n \n \n13-3 \n \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL  PN \nRevised  (11-06-24) PN 628"

    "content": "4  \n HB-1-3550  \nParagraph  13.3 Regular  Servicing  \n \nIf the borrower requests a partial release of security or authorization to lease mineral \nrights, Field  Staff  may be asked  to examine the site to determine  whether  the proposed  action \nwill have an adverse effect on the security property. A local perspective may be particularly \nuseful, for example, if Field Staff are familiar with nearby properties that have experienced similar mineral activity.  \n \nThe Servicing Office is responsible for most subordination requests and may request \nassistance from  the Field  Office.  The Field  Office  may  approve  a subordination in the case of a \nborrower who is obtaining private credit for repairs to the security property, and the lender requires a prior lien.  \nIn accordance with RD Instruction 1970- A, 1970.8 (e), “servicing actions are directly \nrelated  to financial  assistance already  provided, do not require  separate NEPA review,  and are \nnot actions for the purposes of this part”.  \nD. Appraisals  \n \nField  Staff  may be asked  to conduct  appraisals  for the  Servicing  Office.  In these cases, \nField Staff also are responsible for conducting administrative and technical reviews of these appraisals.  \n \nSection  5 of Chapter  5 of this Handbook provides  detailed  guidance  on conducting \nappraisals.  All appraisals done as part of a servicing action must include the appropriate level of \ndue diligence, which includes completing Chapter 5, Attachment 5 -B of this handbook. \nE. Insurance  Claims  \nBorrowers with insurance claims must contact the Servicing Office to establish a plan \nto repair or rehabilitate the security property. If the insurance claim proceeds will not be used to redevelop the security property, the amount received must be applied to the account. The responsibilities placed upon the Field Staff and the Servicing Office in the administering of an insurance  claim  fall within  one of the following three categories,  which  consider  the amount  of \nthe insurance claim, the repair or rehab co st and the risk to the government:  \n \n• Total  claim  of $7,500 or less and the borrower’s  account  is curren t: Field  Staff \nendorses the check to the borrower after reviewing the adjuster’s  worksheet. \n \n• Total  claim  exceeding  $7,500 but less than  $30,000 or claims  of $7,500 or  less and \nthe borrower’s account is not current: Field Staff forwards insurance proceeds  to \nthe Servicing Office’s insurance escrow, and inspects the work as requested by the Servicing Office.

Administering  Insurance  Proceeds  \n \nIn cases where the amount of the insurance loss claim check is $7,500 or less and the \naccount is current, Field Offices are authorized to endorse insurance claim checks without recourse provided the borrower  provides  a copy of the adjuster’s  worksheet  and documentation \nthat repairs will be made or has been completed. If the borrower does not have this documentation, the Field Office will contact the SFH Assistance Section at 1 -314-457-5200 \nfor further guidance. Field Offices should first review the adjuster’s worksheet to ensure that the check is the total claim disbursement.  \n \nWhen Field Offices have endorsed an insurance check for $7,500 or less, they will cue \nthe Servicing Office utilizing Task 285 and provide the claim check amount and date of the  \nloss.

The Servicing Office will cue the Field Office if further actions are needed  at the Field \nOffice level.  \n \nFor significant rehabilitation (a total claim of more than $30,000) all development will \nbe completed under the supervision of the local Field Office. The insurance proceeds may be provided to the Field  Office  to establish  a supervised bank account  or retained  for disbursement \nat the Servicing Office. Development will be managed by the Field Office in a like manner as development funded by loan proceeds. This should include Form RD 1924 -2, Description of \nMaterials, and Form RD 1924- 25, Plan Certification, or a building permit issued by the local \njurisdiction.

    "content": "HB-1-3550  \nParagraph  13.3 Regular  Servicing  \n \nF. Reamortizations and Other Documents  Requiring  Borrower Signature  \nCertain servicing actions may require that a borrower sign a loan document which is \nimperative to continue servicing the loan. Most times, the Servicing Office will mail such \ndocuments to the borrower. In some cases, especially when the document will remain in the Field Office,  executing the document locally makes better sense. In these cases, the Servicing \nOffice  will advise the borrower to call and make an appointment with the local  Field  Office  to \nsign the documents. \n \nThe Servicing  Office  will also notify the Field  Office  and will provide specific \ninstructions on what actions must be taken. For example, when a loan is reamortized, the borrower must execute Form RD 3550-18, Reamortization Agreement. The Servicing Office will prepare  the form and  contact both the borrower and Field Office with instructions on \nexecuting this form. Since the form modifies some terms of the promissory note, upon execution, the Field Office would file Form  RD 3550- 18 with the borrower’s  original \npromissory note, provide a copy to the borrower, and notify the Servicing Office that the borrower has executed the document. \nFor reamortizations,  the Field  Office  will type the following statement  below the \nsignatures on the original note or assumption agreement: \n“A Reamortization Agreement dated  in the principal sum of $   \nhas been given to modify the payment schedule of this note.” \n \nG. Payoffs  \nGenerally,  a request  for a loan payoff balance is made directly  to the Servicing  Office.  In \ncertain cases, Field or State Offices may need to obtain a payoff statement on a borrower’s account.  When  needed, Field  /State  Offices  should submit Attachment  13-A, Request  for Payoff \nStatement, to the Payoff Unit at the Servicing Office. If the payoff statement is to be used for internal purposes only, the documentation for determining market value, capital improvements, and closing costs should be maintained in the Field State Office. If the payoff statement is to be provided to a third party, all documentation should be faxed to the Servicing Office along with the attachment.  \nAttachment 13 -A of this Chapter along with supporting documentation must be \nreviewed by a person other than the Rural Development employee making the request.

    "content": "HB-1-3550  \nParagraph  13.3 Regular  Servicing  \n \nH. Final  Payments  and Satisfactions  \nWhen a borrower makes a final payment, the Servicing Office will notify the Field \nOffice. Since the methods and forms for releasing security instruments vary by State, the Field \nOffice is responsible for preparing the necessary satisfaction or other release documents. When the account  is fully  satisfied,  including any subsidy  recapture,  the Field  Office  will submit  these \ndocuments to the borrower, along with the satisfied note and mortgage, unless requested to submit them to another lender or closing agent, as appropriate. In States where the security instruments are not released when the borrower refinances their debt (including an Agency refinance as a special servicing action), but are assigned to the new lender, Field Staff may execute the necessary documents to authorize the assignment. The borrowe r’s case file must be \nretained for 1 full fiscal year after the account is satisfied.  \n \nIn cases where the account is not fully satisfied, such as in the case of a borrower who \nhas elected to defer the repayment of recapture, the security instruments are not released. In these cases, the Servicing Office may advise the Field Office to prepare a subordination of the \nsecurity  instruments.  Field  Offices  need  to follow  the Servicing  Office  instructions  carefully  to \nensure that the correct documents are executed when releasing any security. Satisfaction documents are never sent to a borrower who ha s deferred payment of recapture until the \nrecapture amount is paid in full. \n \nI. Recapture Receivable  Accounts  \n \nDelinquent tax notices/pending tax sale notices from taxing authorities on recapture \nreceivable accounts should be forwarded to the Tax Unit at the Servicing Office for handling. The notices can be faxed to (314) 457- 4535. Upon receipt of a notice of pendi ng tax sale, the \nServicing Office will review the recapture receivable account to determine if it is in the best interest of the Agency to pay the taxes to avoid the tax sale and protect the Government’s interest  in the property. The Servicing  Office  may request  assistance from  the Field  Staff  when \nmaking this decision. A visit to the property may be necessary to determine the condition of the property and an estimated market value. If the taxes are paid the Servicing Office will demand payment from the borrower. If payment is not made a foreclosure action will pursue.  \n \n13.4 SPECIAL  SERVICING  ACTIONS  \n \nA. Borrower  Counseling  \n \nIf a borrower notifies Field Staff that there may be a problem with loan  repayment, Field \nStaff  must  not offer special  servicing  options  or counsel  the borrower  about  specific alternatives. \nInstead, Field Staff should help the borrower place a call to the Servicing Office to obtain this type of assistance.  \n \n \n13-9 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL  PN \nRevised  (03-09-22) SPECIAL PN"

However, it is the responsibility \nof the Servicing  Office  to provide  specific  information  and counseling to borrowers.  Field  Staff \nmust use extreme caution in providing information to borrowers, since detailed information about changes in servicing procedures will be disseminated primarily at the Servicing Office.  \n \nThe Rural  Development  portion of a leveraged/participation  loan is eligible  for the same \nservicing actions as Section 502 and 504 loans. However, servicing strategies may be different because of the Agency’s lien position and the need to coordinate servicing actions with the leveraged/participation lender.  \n \nThe Servicing Office has the primary responsibility of servicing these accounts. On \noccasion, it may be necessary to request the Field Office to provide information on the leveraged/participation lender that is otherwise not available. Likewise, if the leveraged/participation  lender  contacts  the Field  Office  regarding  a specific  account,  they may \nwish to refer the lender to the Servicing Office for assistance.  \n \nB. Protective Advances  \n \nWhen  the Servicing  Office  is contemplating  a protective  advance  for physical  repairs \nbased on a borrower’s report that the  property is in need of repairs, Field Staff  may be  asked \nto visit the property to determine whether the repair is actually needed, and whether the condition of the property warrants additional investment. The Servicing Office also may request that Field Staff conduct inspections of work completed with a pr otective advance.  \n \nField  Staff  who notice  significant  damage or deterioration  in a property that secures  an \nAgency loan should report that information to the Servicing Office. The Servicing Office can then contact the borrower to discuss the condition of the property and determine whether additional action is warranted. Potential contamination from hazardous substances, hazardous wastes, or petroleum products should be reported promptly to the State Environmental Coordinator for further evaluation and guidance.  \n \nC. Refinancing  \n \nBorrowers with Agency nonprogram loans (nonprogram assumptions or credit sales), \nabove -moderate  loans,  or initial Section  502 program  loans  with a term less than 25 years  are not \neligible for payment subsidy. If a borrower with one of these types of loans experiences \ndifficulty, is in danger of losing the home, and it appears that the borrower would otherwise qualify for payment subsidy, Field Staff may be asked by the Servicing Office to consider refinancing the loan.  \n \n \n13-10"

When  an existing  Agency  loan  is being \nrefinanced as a special servicing action, the household’s adjusted income must not exceed the \napplicable moderate- income limit for the area at the time of loan approval and closing.

Missing  Borrowers  \n \nWhen the Servicing Office is unable to locate a borrower, Field Staff may be asked to \nuse local  connections  in an effort  to find them.  This might  include  checking  with neighbors  or \nfriends, contacting local utilities, or checking with area schools. If the borrower cannot be located, Field Staff may be asked to take custody of the property to protect the Government’s interest.  \n \nProcedures  for managing  custodial  property are described  in Chapter  15 of this Handbook.  \n \nG. Payment  Subsidy  Renewals  \n \nPayment subsidy renewals are the responsibility of the Servicing Office.

Personal  contact  by the field is necessary  when \nthe Servicing Office has not received required documentation from the borrower to renew the payment subsidy and the Servicing Office has been unable to make a personal contact.

Preacceleration  Personal Contact  \nTo ensure that a personal contact has \nbeen made with a borrower prior to an \nacceleration,  the Field  Office may be requested \nto personally contact the borrower. Exhibit 13-2 of this Chapter provides an overview of \nthe Personal Service Review process. The Field Office will be requested to contact the borrower when the Servicing Office has been unable to make a personal contact with the borrower within the last 60 days and all required servicing letters have been  sent, \nattempted  phone contacts  have been made, and \nmonthly billing statements have been mailed to the borrower. A personal contact is made  \nwhen  verbal  communication is reached with \nthe borrower either by phone or through a face-to-face meeting or through written \ncommunication from the borrower. Field offices may be able to obtain financial information  which  can be used to recommend \nactions to the Servicing Office such as reamortization, moratorium, debt settlement or acceleration.  \n \nIn cases where the Servicing Office’s \nattempts  to make a personal contact have been \nunsuccessful, the Field Office will be requested  to contact  the borrower using Task  # \n8. Field  Offices  should complete  Task  8 within \n30 days. When Task # 8 is received, the Field Office  must review  the “DEL/LOAN/HISTORY”  and “DIS/HISTORY”  screens  before contacting \nthe borrower. Once the screen is displayed, tab to the “DSP” field and type the word “ALL.” This will provide information on all letters, calls, and notes. Prior to closing the task all contacts and attempts must be documented in “GLOBAL NOTES.” If it appears that additional servicing options are needed, the “Account Issue and Suggested Resolution Sheet” shown as Attachment \n13-B will be used to notify the Servicing  Office  that servicing  assistance is needed.  \n \n    \n \n13-13 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL  PN \nRevised  (11-06-24) PN 628\nExhibit  13-2 \nPersonal  Service Review  Process  \n \nAccount  Review  \nReview  for correct  delinquency status  and that \nall monies have been applied. \nEnsure that payment  subsidy has been  offered \nand that there are no outstanding documents.  \nEnsure moratorium processing  is not \noutstanding.  \nEnsure a reamortization  is not in process.  \nEnsure the Servicing  Office has no open \nresearch tasks.  \nContact Review  \nDetermine if the Servicing Office has spoken \nto the customer  since the account was 60 days \npast due and three attempts have been made within the last 60 days.  \nResolution  \nA task or callback  is requested  to ensure the \nservicing needs of the customer have been met.

For the Agency, a sale to another party avoids the potential costs of liquidation, as well as costs related to owning and disposing of a property. For the borrower, it offers the best opportunity for being released from the debt without a major credit history blemish. A borrower may sell a property to a third party even afte r the account is \naccelerated. Field Offices may become aware of a borrower who desires to sell their property through notification  from  the Servicing  Office  or directly  from  the borrower. If the initial contact \nwas not made through the Servicing Office, the Field Office should notify the Servicing Office of the proposed sale. If it appears that the sale of the property may not pay the debt in full, the Field Office should provide the borrower with a Debt Settlement Packet. \nIf a borrower proposes to sell the property for an amount which may be insufficient to \npay the Agency  debt, prior  liens,  and authorized  selling  expenses,  the Agency may consent  to the \nsale when it is determined to be in the best interests of the Agency. The  Agency  may also \nadvance  authorized selling expenses to facilitate the sale. To determine if the proposed sale is in \nthe Agency’s best interest, a copy of the sales contract, appraisal, and sales expenses are needed. Another lender’s appraisal may be used if it meets Agency appraisal guideli nes. \n  \n \n13-14"

The homeowner  is to be made  fully  aware that \nwhile the Agency is agreeing to release the lien,  they are still responsible for any remaining \ndebt, which can be settled through the debt settlement process.  \nThe denial  letter  should state,  at a minimum,  that the Agency  has reviewed  the request  for \nconsent to sell the property for the proposed sale price and provide specific reasons why the Agency does not consent to the sale. The Field Office should be listed as the contact.  \nIn cases  where a  junior  lien exists,  the State  Director  may approve  settlement of  a junior \nlien to effect  sale of the property  when  it is determined  to be in the Agency’s  best interest.  Field \nStaff will negotiate the lowest cost to have the junior lien released from the security property, \nbearing in mind the Agency only seeks to have the lien released (and not necessarily satisfied). The junior lienholder may still seek recovery from the debtor, if permitted by State law. \n \nThe Agency’s objective is to \nminimize any potential loss to the Government and to the borrower. The \nAgency may consent to a sale for as low as the market value of the property, minus the prior liens and authorized sales expenses. When  the proposed  sales  price is less than the \nmarket value, a net recovery valuation is required. Either action is handled in the Field Office and the final decision to concur with the proposed sale lies with  a Loan  Approval Official.  \n \n  \n \n \n \n13-15 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL  PN \nRevised  (03-09-22) SPECIAL PN  \n  \n \n \n \n Example  - Sale for Less Than Debt  \n \nA borrower’s  debt is $30,000,  the sales  price  of the \nproperty is $28,000, authorized sales expenses are  \n$3,000, and the market value is $28,000.  In this case, \nthe Loan  Approval  Official may consent  to the proposed \nsale since it will net the Agency $25,000 ($28,000  \nminus $3,000 in authorized selling expenses).

Authorized Selling Expenses \nAuthorized selling  expenses  are those  which  a seller \ncustomarily and legally pays to convey title and \nincludes such items as a typical real estate \ncommission, up to three points to enable the buyer to secure credit (but not to reduce the interest rate), \nreal estate taxes, junior liens, deed preparation, \nabstract and title fees, termite and related inspections, title insurance, sur veys, and deed and \nrevenue stamps."

Since these actions involve security property, they are \nhandled in Field Offices. Key actions that require approval from the Agency include subordination, lease of mineral rights, partial  release of security, lease of security property, and \nassumption of indebtedness. \n \nWhen  the Servicing Office becomes  aware of borrower  actions  requiring approval, they \nwill cue the local  Field  Office  and provide  any necessary  information  to facilitate  processing of \nthe borrower’s request. Field Offices will approve or disapprove the actions outlined in this section and will cue the Servicing Office with the outcome. \n \nThis section  first covers  general  guidelines  and procedures  for evaluating  a borrower’s \nrequest  for approval of  an action, with the exception of assumptions of  indebtedness. Specific \nguidelines for each of the actions, including assumptions, follow the discussion of general guidelines.  \n \n13.9 GENERAL  GUIDELINES  \n \nA. Reviewing  Requests  \n \nTo request approval for subordination, mineral leases, partial release of security, and \nlease of security property, a borrower must submit Form RD 465- 1, Application for Partial \nRelease,  Subordination, or Consent. If the information provided is not sufficient  to allow  for a \nthorough evaluation, the Field Office must request additional information from the borrower.  \n \nB. Obtaining  an Appraisal  and an Environmental  Review  \n \nAn appraisal  is required  for the Agency  to subordinate  its interests  or to approve  a partial \nrelease of security  if the amount  of consideration exceeds  $5,000. The borrower  must  pay for the \nappraisal, although the cost for an appraisal can be charged to the borrower’s account. \n \nAn existing appraisal may be used if it is less than 1 year old and appears to reflect \nmarket  value.  An Agency  appraisal  is not required  if a lender  is involved and can provide  an \nappraisal that adequately reflects market value.  \n \n \n \n13-18"

Evaluating and Approving  the Request  \n \nOnce the information  needed  to evaluate the request  has been  submitted,  the Field  Office \nmust analyze the effect of the proposed action on the security property and document the \nconclusions on Form RD 465- 1. Some factors to consider in the analysis include:  \n• The market  value  of the property before  and after  the transaction;  \n• The physical  effects  of the action  on the security  property;  and \n• The assignment  of initial and subsequent  payment  proceeds.  \nIf the analysis  indicates  that the Agency’s  security  will not be put at risk by the action,  an \napproval official may sign Form RD 465- 1. The Office of the General Counsel (OGC) or the \nState Office may need  to provide relevant forms needed to complete the  approval.

Such requests are rare but do occur in situations such as a property in a town located above a coal mine or a property located on a water source. OGC shoul d be involved in \nmineral  lease decisions because State  and local  laws vary. In  addition, an environmental review \nis required in accordance with RD Instruction 1970 series “Environmental”, prior to approval. Subordination of an Agency loan to a mineral lease does not entitle the leaseholder to any proceeds  from the sale of the security property. If the  lease of mineral rights is approved, rental \nproceeds not assigned to the Agency are treated as income and any payment subsidy must be adjusted accordingly. \n \nThe Agency should consent to the lease of mineral rights and the subordination of its \nliens  to the lessee’s  rights and interests  in the mineral activity  if the security  property will remain \nsuitable as a residence, and the Government’s security interest will not be adversely affected.  \n \nTo make this determination, the Agency must consider the effects of leasing on the \nsecurity  property including the potential for the lessee’s  rights of surface  entry  on the property. \nThe Agency  also must ensure that the property remains  decent,  safe, and sanitary  and the value \nof the security property is not decreased below the amount of the loan. \n \n• No decrease in value. If the proposal is not likely to decrease the value of the \nsecurity  property, the lease  may be approved if the borrower agrees:  (1) to use any \ndamage compensation received from the lessee to repair damage to the site or dwelling; or (2) to assign it to the Agency to be applied to reduce principal.  \n \n \n13-21 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL  PN \nRevised  (02-02-18) PN 508"

If the Agency \nbecomes aware of a borrower who is leasing their property, the borrower is not eligible for payment subsidy or special servicing benefits during the period of the lease. Field Offices will notify the Servicing Office and provide any applicable documentation. If they become aware that a borrower has leased the security property, the Agency also should assess the borrower’s ability  to refinance with private  credit.  If the lease  is for a term of more  than 3 years  or contains \nan option to purchase, the Agency may liquidate the loan. Nonprogram borrowers are free to lease their properties without restriction.  \n \n13.14  ASSUMPTION OF INDEBTEDNESS  [7 CFR 3550.163]  \n \nA. New  Rates  and Terms  Assumptions  \n \nWhen purchasing a property currently financed by a Section 502 loan, the new borrower \nwill typically receive new loan funds. However, new rates and terms assumptions must be used \nwhen funding is limited (e.g. in September as a fiscal year is coming to a close and in October when a new fiscal year begins).  In limited funding situations, the debt is assumed on new rates \nand terms as part of loan origination and is addressed in other chapters of this Handbook. Field Offices are authorized to release the former borr ower from personal liability for the amount of \ndebt being assumed  utilizing  Form  RD 3550- 16, Release  from  Personal  Liability.  In cases  where \nthe debt is not being assumed in full, the Servicing Office will handle the settlement of the remaining debt and any release of liability for the portion of debt not being assumed. \n \nB. Same  Rates  and Terms  Assumptions  \n \nIn certain limited cases, generally those involving transfers of title between family \nmembers, a standard industry assumption is permitted. It is known in the Section 502 program \nas a same rates and terms assumption . Under this type of assumption, the existing note and \nterms,  including the interest  rate and the remaining  repayment  period, do not change.  Same rates \nand terms  assumptions  are handled and  approved in the Field  Office.  However, a  recorded  deed \nis required prior to submitting the account to the Servicing Office for processing. If the account \nis past due at the time an assumption is executed, the new borrower will be referred to the Servicing Office to resolve the delinquency.  \n \n \n13-24"

However, payment \nsubsidy can be continued for the new owner only if he or she is eligible for assistance and only at the level for which the new household qualifies. If the transferee is a very low - or \nlow-income person, it may be more beneficial for the t ransferee to assume the loan under \nnew rates and terms.  For example,  if current  interest rates  are lower  or a longer  repayment  \nperiod is necessary, a new rates  and terms  assumption may be of benefit  to the new owner. \nIn those  cases,  if the new owner applies and is program -eligible, the loan will be assumed \nunder new rates and terms or financed with new loan funds.

Advances  for Property  Repairs  \n \nProtective advances for property repairs are made only to protect the Government’s interest  \nin the security  property and should be considered  only if the repairs  cannot  be financed through a \nsubsequent loan. Advances will bear interest at the promissory note rate of the loan against which \nthey are charged. Advances for borrowers with multiple loans secured by the same property should be charged against the largest loan.  \n \n1. Determining  the Need  for Repairs  \n \nThe need  for repairs  may be identified  by the borrower,  Field  Office,  or the Servicing \nOffice. Field Offices are responsible for completing an inspection of the property, \ndeveloping a description of the work required, preparing a cost estimate, and approving the protective advance.  \n \n2. Alternative  Sources  of Funding  \n \nBefore processing the advance, the Field Office \nmust first determine whether it appears that the borrower qualifies for a subsequent loan. If a subsequent loan appears feasible, a loan application will be processed immediately. If the need  for a \nprotective  advance is so urgent, clearly  \napparent that the borrower would not qualify for a loan, is uncooperative, or that a protective  \nadvance is  more appropriate, the Field Office  must document  why  alternatives were not \nfeasible and why the repairs are needed to protective the Government’s interest when processing an advance.

    "content": "HB-1-3550\nSECTION  3: LIQUIDATION \n13.16 OVERVIEW\nThe decision to liquidate a loan is made at the Servicing Office. After acceleration and \nany ensuing appeals, the case is sent to the State Office for completion of the liquidation. Once \nlegal proceedings have concluded, the property will be sold at a fore closure sale. To complete \nthe foreclosure process, the State Office must determine how much to bid and enter that bid at the sale. A net recovery valuation is required. Estimated net recovery value represents the amount that the Agency could expect to recover from a property if it was liquidated after considering all costs  associated  with liquidating, holding, and selling  the property. Handbook-2- \n3550, Attachment  6-A contains  a net recovery  value worksheet to aid in this calculation.  Actual \nnet recovery value is the amount the Agency in fact does recover from the sale of a property, after accounting for all costs.  \n \n13.17  NET  RECOVERY VALUE  \n \nA. Establishing  Market  Value  \n \nThe market value of the property is the \nfundamental basis for establishing the estimated net recovery  value.  All calculations  undertaken on the net \nrecovery value worksheet provide additions or deductions from market value. In no case will a  \n“distressed sale” or similar reduced value be used, resulting in a “double discount” and less recovery for the Government. Costs of liquidation and ownership are considered as deductions from  the market  value in the net recovery  value calculation.  Conversely, likely  major  costs,  such \nas lead -based paint assessment and abatement on an older home or other major repairs, must be \nincluded to accurately determine the Government’s costs of ownership. \n \nB. Environmental Considerations  \n \nThe estimate of market value must take into consideration potential environmental \nhazards that may pose a liability issue for the Agency and the presence of environmental resources for which the Agency will have an affirmative responsibility to take protec tive \nmeasures  once it owns the property. Exhibit 13-3 of this Chapter provides a partial  list of \nenvironmental factors for consideration. \n \nIn order to minimize Agency liability, the Agency must ensure, prior to acquiring \nproperty through foreclosure, that the property has been examined for potential contamination from  hazardous substances,  hazardous wastes,  and petroleum products, including underground \n \n \n13-29 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL PN  \nRevised ( 03-09-22) SPECIAL PN  \n Calculation  of Net Recovery  Value  \n \nMarket  value  (less)  Costs \n(plus) Income  \nNet recovery  value"

Exhibit 13-4 of this Chapter provides the basic security loss formula. \n \nIt is important for the Agency  to consider \nthe basic security loss in determining how to work with the borrower.

The Agency must not consider a borrower’s  offer  to convey the title to the security  property until after the account is accelerated, \nand then only when it is in the best interest of the Government based upon the estimated net recovery  value. After  an account has  been accelerated, a deed  in lieu of foreclosure is processed \nand approved by Field Offices. In exceptional cases where a borrower offers to convey title to the property at a Field Office when the account has not been accelerated, the Field Office will immediately contact the Servicing Office to determine an appropriate course of action.  \n \nTo process a deed in lieu of foreclosure, Field Offices will obtain the following items \nfrom  the borrower:  (1) a warranty  deed;  (2) Form  RD 1955-1, Offer to Convey Security;  and (3) \ncopies of any leases or other documents affecting the title to the property. The borrower should be informed that the deed will not be recorded unless the conveyance is accepted.  \n \nGenerally,  borrowers  will be required  to satisfy  liens  and real estate taxes  or assessments \nbefore conveyance is accepted.

When making this determination the Field Office must consider if \nthe government will obtain a greater recovery on the secured debt than it could by bidding at the foreclosure sale based on the net recovery value and whether the  agency \nwishes to continue with the borrower. If the decision is made to pay off the prior lienhol der a title opinion must be obtained. Field Offices will note the account and fax a \ncopy of the foreclosure notice to the Servicing Office, Direct Loss Mitigation Section at 314-457-4553. The Field Office will need to track the progress of the prior lienholder’s \nforeclosure manually until the time of the sale. Once the foreclosure template is established, the Field Office is responsible for updating the tasks on the template, using the date provided by the lender. If a third party purchases the property at the sale, the proceeds are shown in the sale amount field. Attachment 13- D of this Chapter provides \nguidance for obtaining funds to pay off the lienholder.  \n \nWhen the Servicing Office becomes aware that a prior lienholder has initiated \nforeclosure action, the State and Field Office will be notified by fax and telephone call. When  the Agency  becomes  aware of a prior lienholder  foreclosure,  a determination  must \nbe made whether the Form RD 1927- 8, “Agreement with Prior Lienholder” or similar \nstate form  was executed  in connection with a leveraged  loan. When  the Prior Lienholder \nAgreement was executed, and the lender failed to give notice, the Agency will consult with the Office of General Counsel to protect the Government’s interest. The Agency will also consult  with the Lender  about  compliance  with the Prior Lienholder  Agreement \nand Lenders who fail to comply with the prior notice requirements will be counseled. Lenders  who are unable  to comply with the prior  notice  requirements  should not be \nconsidered for future leveraged packages.  \n \nAssignment  of promissory notes  and security  instruments  is authorized  where  a junior \nlienholder is foreclosing its lien and is paying the Agency in full.  \n \n \n13-36"

The Acceleration  Notice  \n \nIf the Servicing Office determines that the appropriate approach to liquidation is \nforeclosure, the process begins with an acceleration notice. The acceleration notice \ndemands full payment of the account including unpaid principal and interest,  advances, \nand subsidy subject to recapture. It notifies the borrower of: (1) the reason for the \nacceleration;  (2) the amount due; (3) the method of payment; (4) the opportunity for an \ninformal discussion with the decision maker; and (5) the process for requesting an administrative appeal hearing. The notice gives the borrower 30 days to pay in full or \nrequest a hearing.  \n \nThe notice must be sent to the borrower and any cosigners simultaneously  by both \nregular mail and certified mail. If the property address is different from the address of the borrower, the notice should be sent to the property address as well. \n \n2. Treatment  of Payment Subsidy  \n \nIf a borrower is  receiving payment subsidy, the payment subsidy agreement will not \nbe canceled  when  the debt is  accelerated,  but the agreement  will not be renewed  when  it \nexpires unless the account is reinstated.  \n \n3. Special  Servicing  \n \nAfter  a borrower’s  account  has been  accelerated,  the borrower is no longer eligible \nfor any of the special servicing actions described in Chapter 5. \n \n4. Assignment  of Security  Instruments  \n \nAssignment of promissory notes and security instruments is authorized when an \naccount has been accelerated, all appeals have been exhausted, the case has been accepted  by OGC  for foreclosure,  and the Agency  is being paid at least the net recovery \nvalue of the security property. \n5. Offers  to Pay \n \nField  Offices  will refer offers  to cure the default  to the Servicing  Office.

If appropriate, the \nState/Field Office will interact with the Office of the General Counsel/U.S. Attorney’s office  to determine  if a cure can be accepted  and document  the recommendation  in global \nnotes. State/Field Offices may calculate the cure amount or if assistance is needed, contact the Servicing Office, SFH Assistance Section . All funds to cure an account must \nbe certified or remitted using electronic funds (Western Union Quick Collect or Money Gram). The use of Customer Initiated Payments (CIP) or “check by phone” will not be used to cure an account, as these funds are not gu aranteed.  \n \nWhen an offer is made to pay less than the full amount to cure the default, \nAttachment 13 -C must be completed. The attachment, including concurrence by the \nState Director will be sent to the Deputy Administrator, the Servicing Office, for approval  along with any supporting documentation. A request  to reamortize  the account \nmust also be submitted at this time if the borrower is unable to pay the shortage within 30 days from acceptance of the offer. The request for approval of the offer should be submitted to  the Servicing Office, SFH Assistance Section . \nIf approved, the State/Field  Office  will submit  the certified  funds  agreed  upon along \nwith a payment assistance package (if payment assistance has expired).

The lockbox address is USDA/RHS, P.O. Box \n790300, St. Louis, MO 63179.

Review  of the Acceleration  Decision  \nSeveral  remedies  are available to borrowers  who believe their accounts  should not have \nbeen accelerated.

Deficiency judgments will never be sought in the following situations: (1) acceleration is due to an unpaid recapture amount; (2) the borrower was granted a moratorium at any time during the course of the loan and faithfully tried to meet \nthe loan obligations; (3) State law does not permit a personal deficiency; (4) in nonjudicial \nforeclosure States, the United States Attorney will not accept  a referral for the deficiency; or (5) the \nAgency has determined after consultation with OGC that it is not cost effective to seek a deficiency on a particular case.  \n \n13-39 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL PN  \nRevised ( 11-06-24) PN 628"

Establishing  a Bid Amount  \nThe Agency’s bid will be the lesser  of the Agency’s gross investment or the estimated  net \nrecovery value of the security property. \nGross investment is the sum of: \n• The unpaid balance,  defined as: \n◊ In states  with judicial  foreclosure, the judgment account established  as a result of the \nforeclosure judgment. \n◊ In states  with non-judicial  foreclosure, the borrower’s account balance reflecting \nsecured loans and advances. \n• All outstanding  advances and fees charged  to the borrower’s account. \n• Total subsidy  received.  \n• Bidding  at the Foreclosure Sale \nProcedures for bidding at a sale will vary by locality and a local presence may be \nrequired.

In order to acquire the property through the LoanServ System, send Task #229 to the Servicing Office noting the Agency \nwas the successful bidder at the sale. The Servicing Office will  then create the foreclosure \ntemplate  to allow  the field to acquire the property.

Custodial property is borrower -owned property which has been \nabandoned. REO is Agency- owned property to which the Agency has acquired title, either as a \nresult of foreclosure or conveyance by deed in lieu of foreclosure. This chapter outlines the \nrequirements for management of each type of property.  \nCurrent responsibilities of on -site management activities are split between the Field \nOffices and the Servicing and Asset Management Office (Servicing Office) during the \nliquidation process for custodial properties. The Servicing Off ice continues to be responsible for \nthe financial management.  \nResponsibilities for oversight of on -site management is now referred to the Responsible \nParty. The Responsible Party may be both the Servicing Office, the Field Office or an independent authoriz ed government contractor.  \nThe goal of property management is to protect the Government’s interest; consequently, \nefforts to secure property should begin as soon as the Agency has control.  \n \nSECTION 1: PROPERTY MANAGEMENT METHODS AND ACTIVITIES  \n \n15.2 MANAGEMENT M ETHODS AND CONTRACTS  \nThe Agency may conduct the management activities discussed in this chapter using \nAgency staff or may contract with qualified entities to perform them. The method of management depends on such factors as the number of properties to be managed, their location, condition, the necessary maintenance, and the availability of qualified staff. In some cases, a simple maintenance contract is all that is needed; in others, the Agency may require a complete management contract where a contractor provides all property management services, including, but not necessarily \nlimited to securing and cleaning up the structure, yard work, arranging for and inspecting repairs, paying utilities, and coordinating with contractors, potential buyers or brokers for access to the property.  \nA.

    "content": "HB-1-3550 \nParagraph 15.2 Management Methods and Contracts  \n \nB. Management Contract Requirements \n \nAt a minimum, management contracts must:  \n \n• Allow for properties to be added or removed from the contractor’s assignment, \nwhenever necessar y, such as when a property is taken into custody, acquired or sold \nduring the period of a contract; and \n \n• Prohibit the preparer or his/her associates from doing any of the repair work when a \ncontract calls for specification writing  services.  \n \nIf a contract includes marketing or broker services and involves management of 5 or more \nsingle family homes in the same subdivision, the contractor must develop and obtain Agency \napproval of an Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan, as  described in RD Instru ction 1901- E. \nThe contracting official approves the plan, however, any questions that might arise with respect to an Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan should be directed to the Civil Rights Coordinator in the State Office.  \n \n15.3 TAKING  POSSESSION  \n \nA. Taking  Custodial Possession  \n \nThe Agency may need to take custody of security property when a borrower becomes \nincapacitated, dies or has abandoned a security property. When the Servicing Office  is unable to \ncontact a borrower, the Responsible Party will be reque sted to inspect the property to determine \nits status and to attempt to contact the borrower.  When the Field Office believes that a property may be abandoned, it will report to the Servicing Office . \n \n1. Determining Whether A Property Has Been  Abandoned  \n \nThe d etermination that a property has been abandoned requires significant \ninvestigation and documentation.  In addition to the  actions described in this \nparagraph, the Responsible Party  must follow any procedures required by State or \nlocal law in order to confirm the determination of abandonment and to take custodial possession. A property is not considered abandoned if the borrower occupies the property, even if it is not being well maintained. Similarly, a property is not considered abandoned when the borrower  does not occupy the dwelling but has made \narrangements for its care. The Agency cannot act to obtain possession of a property as long as a lien holder has possession of the property, or the borrower or the lien holder has a right to lease proceeds.

Recommendation for Taking  Custody  \n \nThe Responsible Party will submit a report of its finding to the Servicing Office  with a \ncopy to the State Director advising that it appears the property has been abandoned and the \nAgency needs to assume responsibility for it in order to protect the security. Alternatively, if the Responsible Party  reports that the property is occupied, the report will give details as \nto whether the occupant is under a lease or is unauthorized. The Responsible Party  will \nprovide any other relevant details and make the decision to take custodial possession of the property, as appropriate.  The Responsibl e Party  will notify the Servicing Office  when \nthe action has been taken.  \n \n3.

The Responsible Party must \ninspect the property to:  \n \n• Determine what steps need to be taken to further ensure its security and maintain its \nvalue.  \n• Identify  whether  the property  is occupied  and, if occupied, the intent of the occupants.  \n• Classify the property as program and nonprogram and evaluate the need for  repairs.  \nA. Inspecting and Classifying the Property [7 CFR  3550.251(c)(1)]  \n \nThe Responsible Party must designate REO property as program or nonprogram (NP) \nproperty after considering factors such as size, design, possible health and/or safety hazards, and \nobsolescence due to functional, economic, or locational  conditions. A property that meets the \nrequirements for program property, as described in Chapter 5, is classified as program property. Property that has been enlarged or improved, so that its value is clearly above program standards, or a property that would require major redesign or renovation to be brought to program standards, should be classified as NP property. REO property in an area no longer designated rural is treated as if it were still in a rural area.  \n \nFor program property, a listing of needed repairs or improvements will be prepared. For \nNP properties, a listing should be prepared of any health and safety hazards which must be removed to release deed restriction. Repairs, if required, are typically a condition of sale and repair lists should be  incorporated with the sale listing for all REO.  \n \nIf the REO is occupied, preparation of the repair list may need to be delayed until the \nproperty is vacated, depending on the cooperation of the occupants. In this case, the status of the property should be monitored regularly. \n \nThe basis for classification as program or nonprogram must be thoroughly documented. \nImproper classification of the REO could result in an unsound loan if, for example, the remaining life of the property is less than the term of the loan. (A manufactured home with 15 -20 years \nremaining life is not sound security for a subsidized loan with a minimum term of 25 years.) Classification as NP may significantly reduce the amount the Government could recover (especially if the REO i s then leased) or could deprive a program -eligible family of an affordable \nhome.

However, in special cases, such as \nwhen custodial property is subject to lengthy liquidation proceedings or legal problems prohibit the \nimmediate sale of an REO property, the property may be leased. Custodial property cannot be leased if extensive repairs are necessary in order for it to be inhabitable. Properties subject to redemption rights cannot be leased unless the Responsible Party obtains prior approval from OGC. Property which does not meet de cent, safe and sanitary standards will not be leased.  \nIt is preferable to lease the property to an intended buyer. The Agency may require a \nprospective renter to make a purchase offer, and submit an application for credit and a credit report paid for by the applicant. The rent charged should be a market rent equivalent to rents of similar properties in the area. If the lessee is a program applicant, the monthly rent may be based on the \nestimated monthly loan payment taking into consideration any payment ass istance, plus 1/12 the \nsum of the estimated real estate taxes, property insurance, and maintenance payable by a \nhomeowner. In no case will a lease be for a token amount, even if the tenant is willing to barter for maintenance or repair services.  \nA lease fo rm approved by OGC will be used. A copy of the lease should be sent to the \nServicing Office , where a lease account will be established in the lessee’s name.  \nWhen a lease is terminated, or when the property is sold before expiration of the term \nshown on the  lease submitted to the Servicing Office , the Responsible Party must notify the \nServicing Office  of the termination and the effective date of the termination. \nA. Security Deposits  \nThe Agency requires a security deposit of one month’s rent, except from nonprofit \norganizations or public bodies. Security deposits are remitted to the Servicing Office . When a \ntenant vacates the property, the Responsible Party  sends a memorandum to the Se rvicing Office  \nasking for the return of the deposit to the Responsible Party for delivery to the lessee. If the deposit is to be retained by the Agency, it is applied to the borrower’s account for custodial property or to the REO account, as appropriate.  \nB. Costs and  Income  \nExpenditures on leased custodial properties are charged to the borrower’s  account. \nExpenditures on REO property are charged to the REO account. The Agency does not pay utilities or any other costs of operation of leased property. Lease proc eeds for custodial \nproperties are applied to the borrower’s account.

Use by Federal Emergency Management Agency  (FEMA)  \n \nBy a Memorandum of Understanding between the Agency and FEMA (see Attachment 15 - \nE), REO property which is not under lease or sales agreement is available to shelter disaster victims in an area designated as a major disaster area by the President. In such an event, FEMA assumes responsibility for all costs associated with inhabiting the dwelling.  \n \nFEMA and the Agency must sign a “Letter of Assignment,” (see Attachment 15 -F) which \nincludes a mutually agreed upon inspection report outlining the condition of the property being assigned to FEMA. Field Staff should retain the Letter of Assignment in the REO file. No rent is \npaid by FEMA for the first 12 months from the date of the letter of assignment of the housing.  \nBeyond that, FEMA pays the monthly fair market rental value as de termined by the Agency. \n \nC. Mineral Leases  \n \nWhen it is in the best interest of the Government, the Agency may lease mineral rights.  \nOGC should be contacted for assistance in preparing the lease agreement. The appropriate level of environmental review must be completed prior to any agreement to lease mineral rights.  Since such actions may be controversial and may have the potential for significant impact on the environment, prior consultation with the State Environmental Coordinator is required."

This Task Force, which includes \nrepresentation from several Government Agencies including the Rural Housing Service (RHS) (formerly FmHA), is responsible for developing and examining Federal resources such as Government inventory properties which may be utilized by the homeless. A Memorandum of Understanding was established between the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Health and Human Services to make av ailable vacant single family houses, by lease, to public \nbodies and nonprofit organizations for transitional housing for the homeless. In lieu of cash rent, the entity is required to maintain the property, pay real estate taxes and maintain property insura nce. \n \nRHS is committed to working with community based organizations in this regard to the \nextent practicable.  \n \nGeneral Guidelines  \n \n1. Program and nonprogram RHS real estate owned (REO) properties are available for lease in accordance with 42 U.S.C. 11408a.   \n \n2. Leases of REO properties will be for a period of up to 10 years.

Whenever possible, preference will be given to selling REO \nprogram property to buyers eligible for Direct or Guaranteed SFH programs. The authorized RD \nofficial mentioned throughout this chapter will depend on whether the state has centralized their \nforeclosure and REO processing with theServicing and Asset Management Office (Servicing \nOffice). For those states that have centralized their foreclosure and REO processing, the \nServicing Office is the authorized RD official. For those states that have retained those \nfunctions, the State Director or designee is the authorized RD official. \n \nResponsibilities for oversight of disposing of REO Properties is now referred to the \nResponsible Party identified by the Agency. The Responsible Party may be both the \nServicing Office, the Field Office or an independent authorized government contractor. \n \nA. Sale Methods andPricing \nMost REO properties are sold through real estate brokers. However, the Responsible Party  \nmay sell properties through sealed bid, auction, negotiation, or agreements with other Federal \nagencies, such as the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). \nREO housing for program eligible borrowers is initially priced for sale based upon its “as \nis” market value with adjustments made based on the Agency’s liquidation value factors which \ncan be found in the SFH Direct SharePoint site. Administrative price reductions are to be taken \nover time to facilitate sale of the property (see Paragraph 16.3 B. for a discussion of price \nreductions). A schedule is published that restricts sales of program property to program-eligible \nbuyers for a period of time before any offering to the general public. \nAn Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan, as described in Paragraph 16.4 A., must be \nprepared when 5 or more REO properties are for sale in the same market area at the same time. \n16-1 CHAPTER 16: DISPOSING OF \nREAL ESTATE OWNED PROPERTY"

If an REO property is sold for less than the appraised value to a \nprogram borrower, the equity credited to the borrower in the Form RD 3550-12, Subsidy \nRepayment Agreement is the difference between the selling price and the loan amount. \nNonprogram credit terms may be offered to investors or when the buyer is not eligible for \nSection 502 assistance or the property does not qualify as a program property.  Investors and \nother nonprogram applicants are not subject to income eligibility, asset, citizenship or occupancy \nrequirements to be extended credit. Chapter 11 provides instructions for processing loans on \nnonprogram terms.  Buyers who receive financing on nonprogram terms must be advised that \nthey are not eligible for payment subsidies or moratoriums. \nC. Warranty \nThe Agency does not provide a warranty of either the title or the physical condition of \nany REO property except with regard to contamination from hazardous substances or petroleum \nproducts. Section 4 of this chapter provides additional guidance for managing hazardous \nsubstances when disposing of REO property. \nD. LoanServ Processing for REO Sales \nLoanServ tracks the progress of REO sales and activities. Agency staff will access \nLoanServ and update activity on specific properties. \n16.2 CONTRACTING FOR SALESSERVICES \nAgency personnel may sell REO property when staffing and workload permit, but sales \nare normally handled through the services of real estate brokers. The preferred method for \nobtaining broker services is to enter into an exclusive contract with a single broker. However, \nthe Agency also may enter into open listing agreements that permit any licensed real estate \nbroker to provide sales services. Once a broker has been employed, the Agency will refer all \ninquiries to that broker or to the list of participating brokers."

In order to do business \nwith the Agency, brokers must be properly licensed in the State in which they do business. \nAttachment 16-A provides a sample solicitation package, sample broker qualifications, and \ncriteria that may be used to evaluate offers from prospective brokers. \nB. Announcing Open Listing \nWhen an open listing method is used to obtain broker services, any licensed real estate \nbroker can offer to provide the services.  At least annually, the Agency should announce that \nsales services are being requested by advertising in a newspaper of general circulation or sending \nnotices to all real estate brokers in the counties affected. Attachment 16-B provides a sample \nadvertisement.\nBrokers who respond in writing and are determined to be qualified will be designated as \n“participating brokers.” Each participating broker must execute Form 1955-42, Open Real \nProperty Master Listing Agreement, which provides the terms and conditions under which the \nsales services are to be provided. \nC. Commissions \nBroker’s commissions will be negotiated as part of the selection process and are not paid \nuntil the sale has closed and title has passed to the purchaser. Commissions should not exceed \nthe typical commissions paid for comparable services. \nD. Broker Purchases of REO Properties \nParticipating brokers must notify the Agency whenever a participating real estate broker, \nthe broker’s salesperson, a member of the broker’s or salesperson’s household, or a legal entity \nin which the broker or salesperson has an interest, buys REO property. \nIf Agency credit is required, no commission will be paid to participating brokers who \npurchase an REO property, and only half of the standard commission will be paid to a non-\nparticipating broker who purchases an REO property. \n16-3 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL PN \nRevised (11-03-17)  PN 505"

    "content": "HB-1-3550\n16-4 16.3 PRICING AND SALES SCHEDULES \nREO pricing for program properties is based upon the as-is market value stated in the \nappraisal multiplied by the liquidation value factors posted on SharePoint. The liquidation value \nfactors on SharePoint should not be applied to an appraisal report’s liquidation value, if \napplicable. Nonprogram properties are offered for sale at the lower of Net Recovery Value \n(NRV) or the appraised value multiplied by the applicable liquidation value factor. Additional \nadministrative price reductions may reduce the offering price to facilitate the sale. Mineral, \nwater, and similar rights are generally sold with the property and are not sold separately except \nwhen the Government’s security interest will not be jeopardized. Lease or royalty interests that \ndo not pass by deed are assigned to the buyer. \nA. Appraisals\nTo determine the property’s present market value, the Agency must arrange for an \nappraisal using the procedures described in Section 5 of Chapter 5. If repair or improvement is \nplanned, the appraisal must provide both as-is and as-improved values. Each as-improved \nappraisal must include a list of the planned repairs.  Any special flood or mudslide hazard areas \nor wetlands and any flood plain or wetland use restrictions must be reflected in the appraisal. All \nREO property considered for disposal or lease must be evaluated for possible contamination \nfrom hazardous substances or petroleum products through the process of due diligence and \ncompletion of Attachment 5-B as described in Paragraph 16.18.  This will normally be \ncompleted at the same time as the appraisal.\nA property must be reappraised whenever its condition has deteriorated, it has been \nsignificantly damaged or vandalized, additional repairs and improvements have been made, or \nthere has been a change in market conditions.  Be especially alert to potential contamination \nfrom unauthorized dumping while the property is owned by the Agency and, if necessary, update \nAttachment 5-B and the appraisal prior to sale or lease. The need for reappraisal should be \nestablished as quickly as possible so that the property is based upon its true value. Appraised \nvalue is not affected by administrative price reductions.\nAn appraisal with interior inspection should be ordered immediately after the Agency is \ninformed that the foreclosure sale was unsuccessful, and the Agency has made a determination \nthat the property will be offered initially to program eligible buyers. The appraisal must have an \n“as-is” market value and may include an “as-improved” value if repairs to the property are \nneeded."

The \nAgency may advertise directly or contract for \nadvertising services. Exclusive broker contracts \nmay include advertising services. All \nadvertisements must state occupancy or \nenvironmental restrictions. \nA. Fair Housing and Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan \nAll advertising must meet equal housing opportunity requirements and contain the equal \nhousing opportunity statement and logo.  An Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan is \nrequired whenever there are 5 or more REO properties for sale in the market area at the same \ntime. The plan remains in effect for 1 year or until all properties covered under the plan are sold, \nwhichever is later. When an exclusive broker contract is used, the plan is prepared by the broker \nand approved by the State Director or Servicing Office.  When a sale is conducted by the \nAgency or under an open listing agreement, the plan is prepared by the Agency and must be \napproved by the State Director or Servicing Office.

Exhibit 16-3 highlights these requirements. \nC. Advertising and MarketingMethods\nAdvertising efforts should be designed to reach a broad audience. The Agency should \nidentify appropriate marketing efforts and tailor them for each market area. At a minimum, the \nproperty should be posted on the USDA REO Sales website or designated site provided by \nResponsible Party and posted on the Agency office bulletin board.  Other marketing efforts that \nmay be appropriate include: Property on Tribal Allotted or Trust Land \n[7 CFR 3550.251(c)(3)] \nREO property located on tribal allotted or trust land \nwill be sold or otherwise disposed of only to an \neligible tribal member, the tribe, or to the Indian \nHousing Authority serving the tribe.

Buyer Incentives \nThe State Director or Servicing Office may authorize buyer incentives when a specific \nmarket area is depressed and the incentives are commonly offered to stimulate buyer interest. To \nauthorize buyer incentives, describe past efforts to sell similar properties and explain why the \nproposed incentives are expected to produce improved results. Incentives, such as offering to \nprovide one or more home appliances or to pay closing costs, may be appropriate for any \nproperty. Seller concessions for program applicants should not create overages where the buyer \nreceives cash at closing beyond their out-of-pocket expenses such as the earnest money, \ninspection costs, homeowner’s insurance, etc. Amortization schedules longer than the standard \nterm may be offered for nonprogram properties. \nB. Broker Incentives \nWhen an additional broker incentive is needed, such as when a very low-value property \noffers an inadequate commission, the State Director or Servicing Office may authorize a \nminimum commission or fixed-amount sale bonus. To authorize broker incentives, describe \nthe past efforts to sell the property and justify the amount and the purpose of the incentive. \nUpon the approval of the State Director or Servicing Office, a written offer of the incentive \nthat specifies the requirements and circumstances in which the incentive will be given must be \nprovided to the broker. \nC. Acquisition of Land, Easements, or Rights-of-Way to Effect Sale \nWhen it will help the sale of REO property and it is in the best interest of the \nGovernment, the State Director or Servicing Office may authorize the acquisition of adjacent \nland, easements, or rights-of-way in order to cure title defects or encroachments. Additional land \nmay not be acquired at a cost in excess of its appraised market value. \n16.6 REO PROPERTY NOT MEETING AGENCY STANDARDS \n[7 CFR 3550.251(c) (2)] \nWhen REO property does not meet the Agency’s standards of being decent, safe and \nsanitary (DSS) and it is not economically feasible for the Government to repair it, the property is \nlisted, advertised, and sold with specific occupancy restrictions.\n16-10"

The proposed disposal of REO property will normally \nqualify as a categorical exclusion. However, an environmental assessment, and when necessary an \nEIS, is required for any proposed disposal of REO property that meets one of the following \ncriteria: \n The Agency has reason to believe the transaction would result in a change in use of \nthe REO property within the reasonably foreseeable future. \n There is a violation of applicable Federal, state, or local statutory, regulatory, or \npermit requirements for environment, safety, and health. \n Conditions on the site are likely to cause uncontrolled or unpermitted releases of \nhazardous substances, pollutants, contaminants, or petroleum and natural gas \nproducts. \n There is an existence of controversy based on effects to the human environment \nbrought to the Agency’s attention by a Federal, tribal, state, or local government \nagency. \n The property has an adverse effect on the following environmentalresources:\no Historic properties; \no Federally listed threatened or endangered species, critical habitat, Federally \nproposed or candidate species; \no Wetlands (those actions that propose to convert or propose new construction in \nwetlands will require consideration of alternatives to avoid adverse effects and \nunwarranted conversions of wetlands); \noFloodplains (those actions that introduce fill or structures into a floodplain or \npropose substantial improvements to structures within a floodplain will require \nconsideration of alternatives to avoid adverse effects and incompatible \ndevelopment in floodplains.

    "content": "DETERMINATION  OF AMOUNT OF UNAUTHORIZED  ASSISTANCE   \n \nA. When the recipient was at fault, choose the interest rate (from page 5 \nor 6 of this appendix) that was in effect when the loan was approved and \ncompute interest on the entire loan at that interest rate from the date the loan was closed to the date the letter to the borrower of unauthorized \nassistance is sent. Add the interest to the beginning principal balance, and \nsubtract that from any payments the borrower has made on the loan.\n The \nresult is the amount of unauthorized assistance. \n \nB. When the recipient received interest credits to which he or she was not \nentitled, the amount of unauthorized assistance is considered to be the monthly amount of unauthorized interest credit times the number of months the \nincorrect agreement has been (or was) in effect, without the addition of \ninterest. This formula will be used both in cases where the recipient was at \nfault and where the recipient was not at fault. \n \nC. When the recipient was not at fault and: \n \n1. The entire loan was unauthorized, the amount of unauthorized \nassistance is the outstanding balance (principal and interest) due as of the \ndate of the repayment.  The interest rate will be the rate set in the note. \n \n2. The entire loan was made at the wrong interest rate, the amount of \nunauthorized assistance will be computed as follows: \n \nOutstanding principal balance x (correct rate - note rate) x length of \ntime the loan was outstanding. For example, suppose a borrower received a \n$35,000 loan on February 1, 1982, at 11 percent. The loan should have been \nmade at 13 percent. The borrower has made several payments and reduced the \noutstanding principal balance to $33,500.  The borrower will repay the loan \non February 1, 1984.  To figure the amount of unauthorized assistance; \nmultiply $33,500 x 2 percent x 2 years. The 2 percent is the difference \nbetween the current rate and the note rate. If the borrower was properly \ngranted interest credits, the unauthorized assistance for the time the interest credit agreement was in effect will be zero. For example, suppose a \nborrower's note should have been written at 13 percent but was improperly written at 11 percent.\n The borrower was granted interest credits and has \nbeen repaying at a rate of 1 percent.  It makes no difference what the note \nand the current rates were; the borrower was entitled to repay the loan at 1 \npercent, in accordance with the interest credit agreement. \n \n   \n \n   \n \n \n_ \n \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL PN  \nAppendix 4, Page 5 of 9 \nRevised (07-11-22) SPECIAL PN"

PURPOSE  \nThe following provides general  guidance to Agency  staff for appropriate action  following a \ndisaster covered by a Presidential Disaster Declaration ( Major Disaster Declaration or Fire \nManagement Declaration).  Additional guidance may be provided from the National Office \n(e.g., funding guidance and unique program type codes if special disaster funding is \nreceived).  \n \nField  Offices  should check  the Federal  Emergency  Management  Agency  (FEMA)  website \nat www.fema.gov  for Presidential Disaster Declarations in areas served.  This appendix \napplies to designated areas eligible for Individual and/or Public Assistance. \n \nUnless otherwise specified in this appendix, disaster assistance applications for Section \n502 Direct and Section 504 Loans and/or Grants should be accepted, evaluated, and closed following the same procedures as described in Chapters 2 through 10 and 12 of this Handbook. This applies  to existing  customers  returning for subsequent assistance or \nnew customers. The focus  by Agency  staff will be to serve those affected  by the disaster \nas quickly and efficiently as possible. Awareness of policies and procedures such as proper use of funds remain of the utmost importance. \n \nProcesses  specific  to disaster  assistance  include:  \n \n• Disaster victims should be directed to contact FEMA, the Small Business \nAdministration  (SBA),  their homeowner insurance  company, and other agencies \nor charitable organizations offering assistance.  \n• Agency staff must obtain certification statements from recipients that indicate they have not received  other benefits  for the same  purpose as the RD assistance.  \n• Funds received  from  FEMA  and other sources for disaster  relief  should not be \nconsidered in the net family assets."

This allowance only applies \none year from the declaration date. \n \n• Section  504 grant funds may not be used for cosmetic  improvements (e.g., ceiling \nfans, wall cabinets, or crown molding). \n \nII. ADDITIONAL  STATE/FIELD  OFFICE  ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES  \n \n• Designate an individual to coordinate Rural  Development  response and recovery \nefforts.  \n• Obtain  the State  Preliminary  Damage Assessment  from  FEMA.  \n• Plan and conduct outreach efforts  to reach  disaster  victims.  \n• Consider utilizing  Field  Offices  outside of the disaster  area to support \napplication processing activities.  \n• Coordinate assistance  from  local  appraisers,  insurance adjusters, and other \nagencies to verify losses when possible."

PORTFOLIO  MONITORING  \n \nImmediately following a disaster there is usually little application activity as most \nresidents  are in “recovery  mode”.  Outreach  efforts  take effect  over time,  applications \nbegin coming in, and supplemental funding may or may not become available. The \nfocus is on providing assistance to those in great need. State Offices need to monitor \nactivities of the affected Field Offices during this time.  \n \nItems  to consider include the following:  \n• Are there  outreach  efforts  in all affected  areas  of the designation?  \n• Are funds being  used for persons and families  affected  or displaced  by the presidential declared disaster?  \n• Are disaster  funds utilized  for eligible  purposes?  \n• Do applicants  meet  all 502 or 504 eligibility  requirements?  \n• Does  the property  meet  all 502 eligibility  requirements?  \n• Is FEMA’s  disaster  declaration  specified  in the case files?  \n• Is there certification  and follow up in the applicant’s  case file to indicate  the applicant has not received assistance through homeowner’s insurance, FEMA, SBA \nor other organizations for the same purpose?  \n• Are the disaster  loans and grants coded  properly  (as applicable)?  \nMonitoring by the State  Office  does not end with the file review.  Open  communication \nwith the staff of the affected Field Office(s) is important.  Communication and \ncoordination with other agencies  before,  during, and after  is important to  the success  of \nrecovery."

The \nServicing  Office will continue to  provide customers with  servicing  options and \ndecisions.   \n \nV. CUSTOMER SERVICE  AND LOANSERVICING  \n \nRural Development makes every effort to help existing borrowers who are victims of \ndisaster  to recover  from  the financial  hardship, to minimize  the potential for delinquency \nliquidation, and to protect the Government’s interest. The Servicing and Asset Management Office (Servicing Office) will take the lead. However, Field Office staff \nmay frequently be the first contact point. \n \nField  Staff  should refer  existing  customers  seeking  loan servicing  assistance  to \nServicing Office at:  \n \nUSDA Rural  Development \nServicing Office  \nAttn: Customer Assistance \nPost Office Box 66818 St. Louis, Missouri  63166 -6818 \nPhone: (800) 793-8861 \n \n \nUpon notice of a disaster declaration, collection calls and treasury offset will be \nsuspended for all borrowers  residing in the declaration  area.  In addition, the following \nservicing options will be available for borrowers affected by the natural disaster: \n \nInsured Losses: If security property is to be repaired, the borrower’s Rural \nDevelopment loan account must be current before insurance proceeds can be released. An authorized Field Office employee may release insurance proceeds less than $10,000 to the borrower when presented with the insurance company's repair list. Insurance proceeds of $10,000 or more must be forwarded to Servicing Office, Hazard Insurance Section, according to current claims handling procedures. A Field Office employee will inspect repairs when completed as required under 7 CFR 3550.110(d) (3) and RD Instruction 1924- A. If security property is not going to be repaired, insurance proceeds \nmust be applied  to pay off the loan. Recapture is calculated  based  on the market  value at \nthe time of the loss, according to 7 CFR 3550.162. If market  value is less  than the debt, \nServicing Office will apply the insurance proceeds to the amount of the debt, including recapture. Market value is determined by a recent file appraisal if documented that it represents an accurate indication of value at the time of the loss.  \n \n  \n \nAppendix 10, Page  5 of 6 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL PN \nRevised  (06-02-23) PN 583"

If a borrower incurs an uninsured loss, the Field Office will notify \nServicing Office through Task 285 of the estimated amount of damage to the property and the date of loss. I f a borrower  is unable  to pay off the debt or repair  the house  with \npersonal resources or other credit, the debt must be settled under 7 CFR 3550.253. \n \nMoratorium : Under the exception authority of 7 CFR 3550.8, Servicing Office is \nauthorized to grant a moratorium for a period not to exceed 180 days for 502 and 504 borrowers  located  in the declared  area.  Borrowers  who have  lost employment, sustained \nsevere property damage or medical expenses, should contact Servicing Office for an extension for up to 18 additional months, not to exceed a total of 24 months. After the \ncompletion of the moratorium period, the account will automatically be reamortized.  \nEscrow  will not be required.  \n \nReamortization : Since SBA is statutorily prohibited from making disaster loans  \nto persons delinquent on a federal debt, Servicing Office is authorized to  \nreamortize a delinquent 502 Direct account when a borrower shows evidence of application for a disaster loan from the SBA. \n \nThe primary servicing actions in the natural disaster area will continue to be the \nresponsibility  at Servicing  Office  as described  in this Handbook;  however, assistance \nmay be needed from the Field so that Servicing Office can adequately service the \nloan."

At the decisional phases, the immediate supervis or must attest to the LAO’s decision before the decision can be \nofficially rendered.  Once the immediate supervisor is comfortable with the decisions \nbeing rendered by the LAO, they will: \no Submit a minimum of five Section 502 and four Section 504 files to the State Office for their review. In both programs, one rejected application must be provided in that total. The Section 502 closed loans should include existing homes with repairs and construction (or purchase new); the Sect ion 504 closed loans/grants must include at \nleast one combo.  \n Upon submittal of a minimum of seven  eligibility recommendations (including \nfive eligible and  two ineligible recommendations) to the State Office for their \nreview , conditional authority may be granted to issue  Form 1944- 59, Certificate \nof Eligibility  or Handbook Letter 15, Standardized Adverse Decision Letter,  as \nappropriate, until such time full approval authority is granted.   \n Upon submittal of three closed 502 files of any type (e.g., existing, existing with repairs, new construction, purchase new), conditional loan approval authority \nfor Section 502 may be granted subject to the remaining file reviews to be completed when the next applica ble file type is available for each of them. \n \n For example, if a LAO  submits three closed files that are a combination of \npurchase existing (no repairs) and purchase with repairs, conditional authority may be granted to approve purchase existing (with or without repairs), with the condition that the next new construction a vailable be \nsubmitted for review before being permitted to approve new constructions.   \nThe SFH LAO will still be required to seek supervisor approval before a \ndecision can be officially rendered on the loan and/or grant, they do not have the authority to sign themselves.  \n State Directors have the discretion  to accept an existing home with repairs \nwhich require a construction contract to  be substituted for a new \nconstruction loan. This may only be granted if there is a lack of new construction in the State. \n \n Upon s ubmit tal of  two closed  504 files of any type (e.g. grant -only, loan- only, \ncombo), conditional approval authority for Section 504 loans and grants may be granted subject to the remaining file reviews to be completed when the next applicable file type is available for each of them.

These guidelines are also expanded to accept \napplications from Section 502 self -help borrowers to refinance outstanding self- help loans \nwhich were closed in Fiscal Year (FY) 2020 or later; and to make the Deferred Mortgage \nPayments (DMP) program ( 7 CFR 3550.69) available to Section 502 very lo w-income self - \nhelp borrowers who closed in FYs 2020 or later.  \nThese guidelines are needed in response to the American  Rescue Plan Act (ARPA)  of 2021 to \nensure mortgage payments are more affordable for eligible Section 502 and Section 504 borrowers. Updat es include a fast -track processing option, guidance on determining market \nvalue, guidance on Deferred Mortgage Payments and other self-help guidance, and other clarifications throughout. \nT\nhe American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) of 2021 ( H.R. 1319, Section 3207) appropriated an \nadditional $39 million  of Budget Authority  (BA)  for section  502 and 504 direct  loans,  to remain \navailable until September 30, 2023.  IMPORTANT: However, this BA was rescinded  as part of \nthe Fiscal Responsibility Act which was signed into law by the President on June 3, 2023.  In \norder to provide a wind -down period following the expiration of the ARPA BA under the Fiscal \nResponsibility Act, the Agen cy continued acceptance of these refinance applications (in \naccordance with 7 CFR 3550.201) through June 30, 2023. The Agency will continue to prioritize the refinance applications received by this deadline until all are fully  processed.  \nI\nMPLEMENTATION RESPONSIBILITIES:  \nU\nnless the guidance in this Appendix is supplemented or revoked, the Agency will temporarily \naccept  applications through June 30, 2023, from  existing Section  502 and Section  504 direct loan \nborrowers, to refinance outstanding loans, whic h have been in an approved COVID-19 \nmoratorium or have built a home utilizing the Self-Help Housing Program and closed in FYs 2020 or later, as follows:  \nCOVID-19 Moratorium Status,  Net Tangible  Benefit,  and Borrower Outreach .

Subsidy recapture may be included in \nthe amount to be refinanced if requested by the borrower but should \nbe considered carefully. The analysis must include what the \nborrower’s total outlay will be on the recapture amount being refinanced  (by amortizing  the amount  as applicable)  and comparing to \nthe potential discount the borrower may be eligible for by refinancing the recapture amount (s ee HB -2-3550, Par. 2.25). The ARPA \nWorksheet includes additional information to assist with this  analysis. \nFor example, if a borrower owes $20,000 in recapture, they may receive a 25% discount for paying that off by borrowing new loan funds as part of the refinance; in which case they would need to borrow $15,000 to pay off the discounted recapture amount. Because \nthe $15,000 then becomes principal which  will be amortized  under  the \nnew loan, it must  be determined  whether  the amount  of interest  paid is \nlikely to exceed the amount the borrower saved through the discount.

The Self-Help  Program  is authorized  under  SEC. \n523. [42 U.S.C. 1490c] of the Housing Act of 1949, as amended and is further defined at 7 CFR 1944, \nSubpart  I as well as RD Instruction  1944 -I. The purpose  of this program  is to facilitate  the efforts  of both \npublic  and private  nonprofit  organizations  providing oversight  to low and very  low-income  families  who, \nwith the benefit of technical assistance, participate in Self- Help housing programs.  Section 523 grant \nrecipients  (hereafter  referred  to as  Grantee) use funds  primarily  for administrative  costs  to seek  out the \nland for construction, package loan applications for participants, acquire quotes for building materials, aid in the solicitation and selection of subcontracted labor, and direct program participants in tasks to \ncomplete 65% of the labor contributed to constructing the dwelling or for rehabilitation projects, plan labor tasks that will contribute to the owner realizing cost savings.  \n \nThe Section 502 Direct Home Loan Program is typically utilized by participants choosing to build their homes in the Self -Help Program. In some areas, the Section 502 Program is used to acquire and \nrehabilitate  existing  homes.  For owner  occupied  rehabilitation,  the Section  504 Program  is encouraged. \nProcessing steps for a 502 or 504 Self- Help loan follow the requirements of Handbook -1-3550 and RD \nInstruction 1924 -A unless otherwise addressed in this Appendix.  \nII. APPLICATION  PROCESSING  PRIORITY.  Chapter  3 of this Handbook  discusses  application \nprocessing priorities.  Self-Help applications receive a priority four.  They are priority four given the \nbenefit of this partnership to all involved and given that delays in loan processing adversely affect a \nGrantee’s  production  goals  for their  grant.  When  Grantees  are unable  to meet  their  production  goals \nfor a grant, the cost of that program rises.  Field Staff should consider these factors when processing \ncategory four applications.  \n \nIII. SELF -HELP  LOAN  APPLICATION  PACKAGING.  Part of the requirements  for Grantees  \nIs packaging 502  Direct  loan  applications  to Rural Development for Self-Help  Program  participants.  Self- \nHelp packaging is separate from the certified packaging process, but Grantee’s must follow the process \nfound in Attachment 3 -A of this handbook, including the use of the required applicant disclosure letter, \nApplication/Property Submittal Cover Letters, eForms for application submittal, etc.  As described in \nAttachment  3-A of this handbook,  all packagers  act as a “liaison”  between  the applicant  and the Agency, \nand it is important that the Field Staff keeps the Grantee informed throughout loan application \nprocessing.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAppendix  13, Page  1 of 7"

If the Grantee has another \nsource of Federal funding such as the Self -Help Opportunity Program (SHOP) funded by the U.S. \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Rural Development should coordinate with the other  Federal Agencies  to jointly  process  the ER. Guidance  for ERs is found  in RD Instruction  1970  series \n“Environmental” and Chapter 1, Paragraph 1.14 A. of this handbook.  \nV. APPRAISALS.  Appraisal ordered  by Grantees  will be accepted  provided  that:  \na. Rural Development  is notified  of the intent  to order  and the cost of the appraisal prior \nto any contractual commitment.  Once notified Rural Development will:  \ni. Within three business days of receiving this notification, issue the applicant a \nthird -party  appraisal Loan  Estimate (LE) and accompanying  tailored  Handbook \nLetter 5.  \nii. RD will list the cost of the appraisal as provided by the third party, which may \nexceed  the Agency’s  prevailing  appraisal fee in Paragraph  5.20 of this handbook.  \nb. Orders  the appraisal only  after:  \ni. Receiving  notification  from  Rural Development  to proceed  with  the order.  \nii. Explaining to the applicant that they are ordering the appraisal on the applicant’s  behalf  and that the applicant  will have  to cover  the fee, out-of- \npocket, if the loan does not close.  \n• The Grantee may  choose  to collect  the appraisal fee from  the applicant \nprior to ordering.  The appraisal fee, even  though  paid  to the Grantee,  is \nan allowable excess cost and is eligible to be reimbursed to the \nborrower from their loan proceeds at loan closing. A paid receipt must \nbe forwarded to the Field Office to ensure proper credit and disclosure \non the settlement statement.  \nc. The Grantee  will provide  a copy  of the paid  invoice  for the appraisal  along  with  a copy  of \nthe appraisal that:  \ni. Meets the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice and Agency appraisal standards,  as described  in Chapter  5, Paragraph  5.14 of this Handbook, \nand 7 CFR 3550, § 3550.62 Appraisals.  \nii. Lists  Rural Development as an “intended  user.”  \nd. The appraisal is reviewed  for acceptability  by Rural Development.  \ni. Rural Development  must  complete  Form  RD 1922 -15, “Administrative  Appraisal \nReview for Single Family Housing.”  \nii. At a minimum,  the first five appraisals  obtained  by a Grantee  will receive  a pre- \nclosing technical review.  \n \nAppendix  13, Page  2 of 7"

All appraisals  submitted  by Grantees,  which  are subject  to a technical  preclosing \nreview,  must be  entered  into the Appraisal Hub on SharePoint  to assist  with the \nmonitoring of performance and compliance.  \niv. RD staff appraisers  should  complete  their  review  within  three business  days.  At \nthe discretion of the appraisal staff, additional revisions or reviews may be \nrequired.  \nv. When  additional  revisions  are needed,  they  will be addressed  by RD staff \nappraisers, in coordination with the Field Staff, and the third party.  \ne. Once  the Administrative  Appraisal Review  (and  any applicable  technical  pre-closing \nreview)  determines  the appraisal is acceptable,  the RD processing Field  Office  must \nensure the applicant is promptly provided a copy.  \n \nLoan  funds  may  be used  to reimburse  the payor of the appraisal fee at loan  closing.  The amount \nof reimbursement for the appraisal may exceed the Agency’s standard appraisal fee (Chapter 5, Paragraph  5.20).

LOAN APPROVAL AND CLOSING.  Applicants for a self- help loan will be issued Handbook Letter \n16-A (3550), Eligibility of Self- Help Applicants  (valid for 180 days) , or Handbook Letter 16 -B, Eligibility of \nSelf-Help Applica nts - Owner Occupied Rehabilitation , as applicable .  UniFi may indicate the applicant \nqualifies for a higher loan amount than the actual cost of building a modest home using the self- help \nmethod or applicants may need to be considered for compensating factors and/or a 38 -year term to \nqualify for the loan amount necessary to participate in the program .  The dollar amount to be inserted in \nthe eligibility letter will be based the lesser of what they qualify for or on the following:  \n \na. The estimated cost to build the home; or  \nb. For acquisition rehabilitation, the cost to purchase and repair the home.     \nc. For owner occupied rehab  (Handbook Letter 16 -B), the estimated cost to repair the home.  \n \nVII. SELECTING A CONTRACTOR.  RD Instruction 1924 -A describes authorized construction \nmethods which are the contract, borrower, Mutual Self -Help, and owner -builder. The Mutual Self- Help \nmethod is defined as the performance of work by mutual labor under the direction of a construction \nsupervisor. The ways of doing the work, buying materials, and contracting for special services are like \nthose used in the borrower method whereby the owner acts as their own general contractor. In the \nMutual Self- Help method, a group agreement acts as the governing document between the builder and \nthe Grantee.  The group agreement is a vital document that outlines roles and responsibilities, labor \ncontribution requirements, subcontracting arrangements, grievance procedures, and other items  \nrelated  to the group  build.  The Loan  Approval  Official  must  be familiar  with  this agreement  which  is part \nof the approved Self -Help application docket. All changes must be reviewed by the Agency prior to use.  \n \n \nAppendix  13, Page  3 of 7 \n \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL PN \nRevised (06 -06-25) PN 643"

    "content": "HB-1-3550   \n Under the  Mutual Self- Help  method, the  Grantee is NOT a  contractor  and should  NOT  be asked  to sign  a \nconstruction contract or builder warranty. RD Instruction 1944 -I, § 1944.406 of this section, specifically \nprohibits  the Grantee  from  hiring  personnel  for the purpose  of performing  the participants’  construction \nwork on the homes. Construction supervisors assisting families in building homes can perform work \nalongside the families so long as they do not perform an entire task solely and their work is not the \ndetermining factor of completing the task.  \n \n Grantees  are vetted  through  the Section  523 approval process  and are not checked  as a \ncontractor through Do Not Pay (DNP).  \nVIII. CONSTRUCTION DOCUMENTS. The items listed below are submitted as part of the Section \n523 application  process  but must  be updated  as needed  and submitted  by the Grantees  as part of each \nSection 502 construction package as follows:  \n \n• Plans  and Specifications.  The building plans  and specifications  should  be signed  by the Grantee \nand the applicant on each page.  \n• Form  RD 1924 -2, Description  of Materials.  Required  to be submitted  for each  application  file. \n• Form RD 1924 -25, Plan Certification.  The plans, specifications, calculations, and any \nmodifications  must  be certified  by the design  professional  on Form  RD 1924 -25, to ensure  that \nthe appropriate codes and standards are met.  \n• Development Budget.  The development budget may include an amount for construction \ncontingencies  resulting  from  unusual  and unforeseen  circumstances  beyond  the contractor’s  or \nborrower’s control (refer to Chapter 5, Paragraph 5.23 A of this Handbook, for the allowable amount and conditions).  Form RD 1924 -1 “Development Plan” is not required, provided the \ndevelopment budget contains the same information that would be recorded on the form.  \nThe Grantee is responsible for subcontractor communication, and the Rural Development file does not \nneed  to contain  pre-construction  meeting  documents  as it would  with  new  construction  other  than  Self- \nHelp.  Construction may not begin until the loan has closed.  \nIX. SUBCONTRACTS. Grantees work with subcontractors and suppliers to procure the needed \nsupplies and skilled labor required to complete the homes.  The Grantee obtains bids and selects the \nbest available contractors/suppliers.  The borrowers’ 502 loan funds are then used to make the \npurchases and pay invoices.  To this end, contracts with subcontractors/vendors must be signed by the \nowner/builders but may be made individually with each owner/builder or as a group.  Group contracts \nmust  clearly  identify  the charge  to each  participant, allow  warranties  to be issued  directly  to the owner, \nand must allow homeowners to work directly with the subcontractor for warranty work. In either case, the group agreement, signed by participants, should specify which process(es) the Grantee will be \npermitted to use.  Subcontracts in Self -Help are unlike those in construction with a general contractor \nbecause  funds  are paid  directly  to the subcontractors.  For this reason,  it is reinforced  that the following \nare required for subcontracted work under the Self -Help Program:  \n \n \n \nAppendix  13, Page  4 of 7"

    "content": "HB-1-3550   \n • Do Not Pay.  Subcontracts  $25,000 or more require  clearance  through  the DNP  system. See \nParagraph 4.11 A for guidance on the DNP portal.  \n• Contractor’s Final Release and Waiver of Lien. Each subcontractor used during \nconstruction  must  sign Form  RD 1924- 9, “Contractor’s  Final Release  and Waiver of Lien.”  \n• Release of Claimant. Each subcontractor used during construction must signs Form RD \n1924- 10, “Release by Claimants.  Grantees”  will maintain  a list of subcontractors  for each \nbuild to ensure this form can be easily obtained prior to final payments being made.  \n• Builder’s  Warranty.  Individual  warranties  offered  on materials  and subcontracted  labor \nshould  be given  by the Grantee to the owner  with  a copy  to the Rural Development file. \nGrantees should not be asked to sign any warranty forms.  \n \nX. ADMINISTERING CONSTRUCTION FUNDS. In the Self -Help Program, Grantees are \nprohibited  from  using  Section  523 grant  funds  to pay  for the construction  of the homes.  Again,  the \nGrantee  is not  a contractor  so Field  Offices  should  advance  draws  to avoid  any need  to reimburse  a \nGrantee’s  unrestricted  funds  that may  have  been  used  to pay for home  construction  while  awaiting  \ndraws from the 502 accounts. To this end, draws against the 502 builders’ accounts will be guided by work in place and work to be completed in the next 30 days.  Self-Help draws are not subject to the \nrelease of funds based on 60 or 90 percent of the work in place which is required under the contract \nmethod for new construction with a contractor.  Grantees may request up to 100 percent of work in \nplace as well as an advance for large, planned purchases in the next 30 days.  At closing, an initial draw \nto cover  the land,  plans/specs,  permits,  and other  costs  which  will be incurred  within  the first 30 days  of \nclosing (such as opening the supervised or custodial account) maybe be issued.  Provided the borrower \nhas signed off on the draw request (see RD Instruction 1944 -I, 1944.425 (b)), treasury checks may be \nmade payable in the Grantee’s name alone when they have been approved to use a custodial bank \naccount in accordance with RD Instruction 1944 -I, 1944.425.  \nField Staff should be aware that group split items are permissible for required building costs \nshared by the group (e.g., shared outhouse, power bill, tool rental, nail buckets, etc.). Draw requests should be made no more than once a month and must  include documentation of the expenditures due \non a detailed coversheet. Copies of corresponding invoices, code inspection reports, and pictures of progress  should  be attached  to the detailed  coversheet,  as applicable  (note  that invoices coming  due in \nthe next 30 days may be unavailable at the time of the request and can be submitted with the next \nmonthly  draw).  The coversheet will be signed  by both  the Grantee  and the participating  family  before  it \nis submitted for processing.  A Rural Development inspection is not required for each draw, but Rural \nDevelopment staff should monitor construction progress as compared to funds drawn down to ensure their general alignment (e.g., if the house is 20% complete, draws should be approximately 20% of the construction costs).  RD Instruction 1944 -I, § 1944.425 of this section, provides requirements that must \nbe met before a Grantee is authorized to manage 502 account funds in a custodial or supervised account.  \nXI. SELF -HELP  INSPECTIONS. Inspection  requirements  are the same  for the Self-Help \nProgram.  An inspection report and pictures from a Grantee can be accepted as a third -party inspection; \nhowever, to avoid any conflict of interest, Grantee inspections should not be the only ones completed. Grantee inspection should be coupled with local county/city inspectors, RD inspections, or other approved  third -party  inspectors.  Inspections  that cause  a charge  to the 502 borrower  account  should  be \nused as a last resort.  Grantees should never be asked to pay for an inspection.  \n \nAppendix  13, Page  5 of 7 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL PN \nRevised  (04-19-24) PN 611"

    "content": "HB-1-3550   \n XII. POST CLOSING LEVERAGED LOANS/GRANTS. Self -Help is a partnership between Rural \nDevelopment and the Grantee and consistent communication is key to success.  If unforeseen \ncircumstances arise and additional funding is needed during construction, the Grantee should contact \nthe borrower and Rural Development immediately.  In some cases, the Grantee may have access to \naffordable home loan/grant products which could be used to cover cost overruns; however, an \nadditional loan/grant  adversely  impacts  a Self-Help builder’s  sweat  equity.  Grantees  who  regularly  \nplace second liens on Self -Help participant’s property is an indication that there is an issue with the \nGrantee’s management/oversight of the project.  State Offices should discuss these occurrences with \nthe National Office for further guidance.  Post -closing loans or grants should NOT  be provided to the \nborrower without notification to Rural Development.  \nXIII. PARTICIPANT WITHDRAWL. In rare cases, a Self- Help owner/builder may be unable to \ncomplete the program.  Grantees should communicate these issues to Rural Development. The group \nagreement  should  provide  instructions for  expelling a member  from  the group, or  a borrower  may  quit; \nhowever, once a loan is closed, the program participant is in ownership of the property and must make \ndecisions  as such.  In the event an owner/builder  will not complete  the home  through  the program,  final \ndecisions regarding how to move forward and complete the house must be made as follows:  \n1. Transfer to Another Self -Help Borrower - The borrower may wish to facilitate the sale of the \npartially built home to another very -low or low -income applicant on the Grantee’s waiting list. \nRural Development  can extend  new  loan  funds  to an eligible  borrower  for such  a transfer (when \nfunds are limited a new rates and terms assumption can be processed).  A purchase and sale \nagreement will need to be executed between the owner and the incoming Self -Help Program \nparticipant.  Parties should consider the closing costs required for the new loan when \nestablishing the sales price (e.g., the closing cost will be seller paid, the applicant will take out a \nsupplemental loan, or some other arrangement).  \n2. Contract  Method-  Some  borrowers  may  wish  to find a contractor to complete  their  home.  This \nwill likely cause the need for the borrower to qualify for a subsequent loan to cover the higher \ncost of building with a contractor.  \n \nThe owner  should  be notified  of their  option  in writing,  given a reasonable  timeframe  to respond  and be \nadvised that the loan must be converted to permeant and payments started if they do not respond.  \n \nXIV. CONSTRUCTION CLOSEOUT. Once construction or rehabilitation work is satisfactorily \ncompleted, Rural Development will coordinate with the Grantee to close out construction, including \nconverting the loan to permanent with payments starting 30 days after.  At least 60 days prior to \nconversion, Rural Development should work with the Grantee to obtain the necessary paperwork for \nconversion including updated income documents, taxes, insurance information, etc.  As with \nconstruction  under  the contract  method,  loan  conversion  MUST  happen  on the first of the month  after \nthe final inspection, issuance of the certificate of occupancy, or the new/repaired dwelling becomes \noccupied.  \nA. Funds Remaining After Completion. Any remaining loan funds which were deposited into the custodial/SBA  account  to pay final invoices  for the home  should  be reconciled  and closed  quickly \nafter conversion.  It is anticipated that any final invoice would be paid within 60 days and  \nunused loan funds will be returned to Rural Development as a curtailment of the loan balance.  \n \n \nAppendix  13, Page  6 of 7"

    "content": "HB-1-3550   \n B. Compensation for construction defects . RD Guide Letter 1924- 1, “Notification to Eligible \nBorrowers  of Benefits  Under  RD Instruction  1924- F” should  be provided  to the borrower by the \nField Office at conversion and will cover any materials/supplies as well as work completed by \nsubcontractors.  \n \nXV. SELF -HELP  TAKE -OUT  LOANS.  Using  the Section  502 Direct  Home  Loan  Program  as take- out- \nfinancing for self- help homes is highly discouraged.  A Grantee’s organizational risk is elevated when \nholding ownership  of the property  during construction.  If a Grantee  chooses  to process  take -out loans, \nRural Development assumes no liability for lack of available funding, unqualified applicants, ineligible \nproperties, etc.  Rural Development will not predetermine eligibility or obligate loan funds outside the \ninstruction of this handbook.  \n \nXVI. OTHER LOAN FINANCING.  There is no requirement for Self -Help Program participants \nto use Rural Development financing. Self -Help Program participants must be at or below Rural \nDevelopments low- income limit for the Grantee to charge the grant for the work completed \nand claim an equivalent unit under the grant. If an owner/builder is not receiving a Rural Development loan, they would not submit an application so Field Offices should refer to RD \nInstruction 1944 -I for information on what documents the Grantee should submit which will be \nkept in the Section 523 file to ensure they meet program requirements.  \n \nXVII. RURAL ELIGIBLITY REVIEWS.  If Section 523 grantee owns or is currently in processes of \nbuying land approved for site development prior to the newly designated non -rural area, \nSection 502 Loan and 504 Loan and Grant assistance may continue to be provided for new and \nexisting homes, within the boundaries of that site until either:  \n \n1) the terms of the grant agreement that concern the site development have been completed, or  \n2) two years has passed from the effective date of the revised designation.  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nAppendix  13, Page  7 of 7 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL PN \nRevised  (04-19-24) PN 611"
