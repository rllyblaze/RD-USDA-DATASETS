Servicing  is mostly  the role of the Servicing \nOffice; however, Field Staff participation is important to maintain quality customer service and to protect the Government\u2019s interest. \n \nWhenever  local  assistance  is needed  to support  a Servicing  Office  servicing action,  the \nServicing Office will request Field Staff support through the LoanServ work queue or via phone. These requests  will provide  direction  about  the work  to be accomplished.  Appendix 13 \ncontains  a Field  Office  Reference Guide  with  helpful  information  on working effectively  with \nthe Servicing Office.  \n \nSeveral  servicing  functions  have  been  permanently  assigned  to Field  Staff.  These include \ncertain borrower actions requiring approval, assessing the borrower\u2019s ability to refinance with private credit, managing Real Estate Owned (REO) and custodial property, the disposition of REO property, and providing satisfactions when loans are paid off. Borrower actions requiring approval and loan satisfactions are discussed in this chapter. The remaining functions are described in detail in the chapters that follow.  \n \nSection  1 of this chapter  describes  servicing  actions  in which  the Servicing  Office  may \nrequest assistance from Field Staff. This servicing action is the responsibility of the Servicing Office; however, assistance may be needed from the Field so that the Servicing Office can adequately service the loan.  \n \nSection 2 deals with servicing actions which are the responsibility of Field Staff with \nField  Staff  making the final decision. Section  3 involves  liquidation  responsibilities  after the \nServicing Office accelerates a loan.  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n13-1 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL  PN \nRevised  (03-09-22) SPECIAL PN\n \nCHAPTER  13: SERVICING  AND  LIQUIDATION \nFUNCTIONS  ",

After loan closing, those borrowers must make the \ntransition  to dealing  with the Servicing  Office.  Field  Staff  can help borrowers  with this transition \nby discussing the post -closing role of the Servicing Office with the applicant throughout the \norigination process,  and emphasizing, during the  applicant  orientation, the importance  of dealing \ndirectly with the Servicing Office. Once the loan is closed, the Servicing Office will contact the borrower in writing before the first billing statement to explain its role as servicer.  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n13-2 ",

Newly -Activated  Borrower  Account  \n \nWhen the Servicing Office receives a new borrower\u2019s loan docket, it will be reviewed to \nensure that the documents are correct, and that the information contained in the legal documents \nmatches the information that has been entered into LoanServ. \nThis will provide a check on the accuracy of all data entry, as well as offering an \nopportunity to identify  and correct clerical errors  that could otherwise result in unauthorized \nassistance.  When  the Servicing  Office  encounters  apparent  discrepancies,  Field  Staff  may be \nasked to assist in correcting problems. \n \nB. Payments  \nField  Staff  should help  borrowers  understand the importance of dealing  directly  with  the \nServicing Office, while still providing appropriate levels of assistance. If a borrower brings a payment to the Field Office, Field Staff should remind the borrower that payments must be sent to the lockbox. Field Staff can forward a payment to the lockbox on the borrower\u2019s behalf; however, the borrower should be advised  that bringing the payment to the Field  Office  will only \ndelay arrival at the correct destination, and the borrower will be m ore likely to incur a late fee \nthan if the payment is sent directly. Late fees are set at 4 percent of the borrower\u2019s scheduled payment for principal and interest and are assessed if the scheduled payment is more than 15 day s \npast due. \nFees on payments accepted by the Field Office will be recorded on Form RD 1951-49, \n\u201cRegister of Collections,\u201d and will be safeguarded in accordance with RD Instruction 1951- B \nand Form  RD 1951-44, \u201cManagement  Control and Review  of Field  Office  Collection  Activities, \nand related Forms Manual Insert.  \nC. Approval Actions  \nThe Servicing Office must approve a variety of actions borrowers may wish to take \nduring the course of their loans, including leasing mineral rights, obtaining a partial release of security,  transferring  title to someone who will assume the indebtedness, and obtaining Agency \nconsent to temporarily not occupy the property or subordinate the Agency loan. In some circumstances, these actions may require on -site expertise.  \n \n \n \n \n13-3 \n \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL  PN \nRevised  (11-06-24) PN 628",
  "page_4": " \n4  \n HB-1-3550  \nParagraph  13.3 Regular  Servicing  \n \nIf the borrower requests a partial release of security or authorization to lease mineral \nrights, Field  Staff  may be asked  to examine the site to determine  whether  the proposed  action \nwill have an adverse effect on the security property. A local perspective may be particularly \nuseful, for example, if Field Staff are familiar with nearby properties that have experienced similar mineral activity.  \n \nThe Servicing Office is responsible for most subordination requests and may request \nassistance from  the Field  Office.  The Field  Office  may  approve  a subordination in the case of a \nborrower who is obtaining private credit for repairs to the security property, and the lender requires a prior lien.  \nIn accordance with RD Instruction 1970- A, 1970.8 (e), \u201cservicing actions are directly \nrelated  to financial  assistance already  provided, do not require  separate NEPA review,  and are \nnot actions for the purposes of this part\u201d.  \nD. Appraisals  \n \nField  Staff  may be asked  to conduct  appraisals  for the  Servicing  Office.  In these cases, \nField Staff also are responsible for conducting administrative and technical reviews of these appraisals.  \n \nSection  5 of Chapter  5 of this Handbook provides  detailed  guidance  on conducting \nappraisals.  All appraisals done as part of a servicing action must include the appropriate level of \ndue diligence, which includes completing Chapter 5, Attachment 5 -B of this handbook. \nE. Insurance  Claims  \nBorrowers with insurance claims must contact the Servicing Office to establish a plan \nto repair or rehabilitate the security property. If the insurance claim proceeds will not be used to redevelop the security property, the amount received must be applied to the account. The responsibilities placed upon the Field Staff and the Servicing Office in the administering of an insurance  claim  fall within  one of the following three categories,  which  consider  the amount  of \nthe insurance claim, the repair or rehab co st and the risk to the government:  \n \n\u2022 Total  claim  of $7,500 or less and the borrower\u2019s  account  is curren t: Field  Staff \nendorses the check to the borrower after reviewing the adjuster\u2019s  worksheet. \n \n\u2022 Total  claim  exceeding  $7,500 but less than  $30,000 or claims  of $7,500 or  less and \nthe borrower\u2019s account is not current: Field Staff forwards insurance proceeds  to \nthe Servicing Office\u2019s insurance escrow, and inspects the work as requested by the Servicing Office. Field Staff should contact the SFH Assistance Section at 314- 457- \n5200 for further guidance. \n \n13-4",

The Field Staff also \nmanages all  steps of construction planning and performance in the same manner they \nwould development funded by loan proceeds following the standards contained in RD Instruction 1924- A. Work is inspected prior to any disbursements. \n \nFor construction contracts  exceeding  $10,000, Department  of Labor  requirements  also \napply.  \n \n1. Administering  Insurance  Proceeds  \n \nIn cases where the amount of the insurance loss claim check is $7,500 or less and the \naccount is current, Field Offices are authorized to endorse insurance claim checks without recourse provided the borrower  provides  a copy of the adjuster\u2019s  worksheet  and documentation \nthat repairs will be made or has been completed. If the borrower does not have this documentation, the Field Office will contact the SFH Assistance Section at 1 -314-457-5200 \nfor further guidance. Field Offices should first review the adjuster\u2019s worksheet to ensure that the check is the total claim disbursement.  \n \nWhen Field Offices have endorsed an insurance check for $7,500 or less, they will cue \nthe Servicing Office utilizing Task 285 and provide the claim check amount and date of the  \nloss. If a borrower notifies a Field Office of an uninsured loss, the Field Office will cue the Servicing  Office  utilizing  Task  285 and provide  the estimated  amount  of damage  to the property \nand the date of loss . The  Servicing  Office  may force place insurance  and submit a claim  to the \ncarrier.  The Servicing Office will cue the Field Office if further actions are needed  at the Field \nOffice level.  \n \nFor significant rehabilitation (a total claim of more than $30,000) all development will \nbe completed under the supervision of the local Field Office. The insurance proceeds may be provided to the Field  Office  to establish  a supervised bank account  or retained  for disbursement \nat the Servicing Office. Development will be managed by the Field Office in a like manner as development funded by loan proceeds. This should include Form RD 1924 -2, Description of \nMaterials, and Form RD 1924- 25, Plan Certification, or a building permit issued by the local \njurisdiction.  All repairs  and replacements  will be planned, performed,  inspected,  and paid for in \naccordance with RD Instruction 1924- A. Payment schedules will be establishe d in the \nindividual repair plan.  \n \n \n \n \n13-5 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL  PN \nRevised  (03-09-22) SPECIAL PN",

Otherwise, Form \nRD-1924- 1, Development  Plan,  or similar  form,  with cost estimates  and specifications,  may be \nused. Unless the borrower method is used, funds will not be advanced for materials or other purposes until work is completed. \n2. Inspecting  Repairs  and Authorizing  Payments  \n \nAs noted above, all repairs  and replacements  will be planned, performed, inspected,  and \npaid for in accordance with RD Instruction 1924- A. Section 6 of Chapter 5 further provides \nguidance regarding how inspections should be conducted and documented. Payment schedules will be established in the individual repair plan and the construction c ontract (if applicable).  \n \nWhen  the insurance  loss claim  is under  the purview  of the Servicing  Office,  Field  Offices \nwill be asked to inspect the repair work and complete Form RD 1924- 12, Inspection Report. \nBefore  each  inspection related  to a progress  payment, Field  Staff  should  request  a check  from  the \nServicing Office.  The check should be made payable to  the borrower and the contractor. If work \nhas been satisfactorily completed, Field Staff will instruct the borrower to endorse the check and give it to the contractor. If the inspection reveals that the work was not completed satisfactorily, Field Staff will void the check and return it to the Servicing Office. After each periodic inspection, Field Staff will send the inspection repor t to the Servicing Office and maintain a  \ncopy in the borrower\u2019s case file. Field Staff will follow up on the adjustment of all losses until satisfactory settlement has been made.  \n \nWhen  all work  has been  satisfactorily  completed,  Field  Staff  will release the final  check \nto the borrower and submit to the Servicing Office all documents required in RD Instruction 1924- A, including: a final Form RD 1924- 12, Inspection Report; Form RD 1924- 9, Certificate \nof Contractor\u2019s Release; Form RD 1924- 10, Release By Claimants; and Form RD 1924- 19, \nBuilder\u2019s Warranty.  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n13-6",

Reamortizations and Other Documents  Requiring  Borrower Signature  \nCertain servicing actions may require that a borrower sign a loan document which is \nimperative to continue servicing the loan. Most times, the Servicing Office will mail such \ndocuments to the borrower. In some cases, especially when the document will remain in the Field Office,  executing the document locally makes better sense. In these cases, the Servicing \nOffice  will advise the borrower to call and make an appointment with the local  Field  Office  to \nsign the documents. \n \nThe Servicing  Office  will also notify the Field  Office  and will provide specific \ninstructions on what actions must be taken. For example, when a loan is reamortized, the borrower must execute Form RD 3550-18, Reamortization Agreement. The Servicing Office will prepare  the form and  contact both the borrower and Field Office with instructions on \nexecuting this form. Since the form modifies some terms of the promissory note, upon execution, the Field Office would file Form  RD 3550- 18 with the borrower\u2019s  original \npromissory note, provide a copy to the borrower, and notify the Servicing Office that the borrower has executed the document. \nFor reamortizations,  the Field  Office  will type the following statement  below the \nsignatures on the original note or assumption agreement: \n\u201cA Reamortization Agreement dated  in the principal sum of $   \nhas been given to modify the payment schedule of this note.\u201d \n \nG. Payoffs  \nGenerally,  a request  for a loan payoff balance is made directly  to the Servicing  Office.  In \ncertain cases, Field or State Offices may need to obtain a payoff statement on a borrower\u2019s account.  When  needed, Field  /State  Offices  should submit Attachment  13-A, Request  for Payoff \nStatement, to the Payoff Unit at the Servicing Office. If the payoff statement is to be used for internal purposes only, the documentation for determining market value, capital improvements, and closing costs should be maintained in the Field State Office. If the payoff statement is to be provided to a third party, all documentation should be faxed to the Servicing Office along with the attachment.  \nAttachment 13 -A of this Chapter along with supporting documentation must be \nreviewed by a person other than the Rural Development employee making the request. The reviewer should be the first line supervisor, or designee, of the Rural Development employee making the request. The name and initials  of the person making the request,  and the reviewer  \nmust be on the attachment.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n13-8",
  "page_9": " \n HB-1-3550  \nParagraph  13.3 Regular  Servicing  \n \nH. Final  Payments  and Satisfactions  \nWhen a borrower makes a final payment, the Servicing Office will notify the Field \nOffice. Since the methods and forms for releasing security instruments vary by State, the Field \nOffice is responsible for preparing the necessary satisfaction or other release documents. When the account  is fully  satisfied,  including any subsidy  recapture,  the Field  Office  will submit  these \ndocuments to the borrower, along with the satisfied note and mortgage, unless requested to submit them to another lender or closing agent, as appropriate. In States where the security instruments are not released when the borrower refinances their debt (including an Agency refinance as a special servicing action), but are assigned to the new lender, Field Staff may execute the necessary documents to authorize the assignment. The borrowe r\u2019s case file must be \nretained for 1 full fiscal year after the account is satisfied.  \n \nIn cases where the account is not fully satisfied, such as in the case of a borrower who \nhas elected to defer the repayment of recapture, the security instruments are not released. In these cases, the Servicing Office may advise the Field Office to prepare a subordination of the \nsecurity  instruments.  Field  Offices  need  to follow  the Servicing  Office  instructions  carefully  to \nensure that the correct documents are executed when releasing any security. Satisfaction documents are never sent to a borrower who ha s deferred payment of recapture until the \nrecapture amount is paid in full. \n \nI. Recapture Receivable  Accounts  \n \nDelinquent tax notices/pending tax sale notices from taxing authorities on recapture \nreceivable accounts should be forwarded to the Tax Unit at the Servicing Office for handling. The notices can be faxed to (314) 457- 4535. Upon receipt of a notice of pendi ng tax sale, the \nServicing Office will review the recapture receivable account to determine if it is in the best interest of the Agency to pay the taxes to avoid the tax sale and protect the Government\u2019s interest  in the property. The Servicing  Office  may request  assistance from  the Field  Staff  when \nmaking this decision. A visit to the property may be necessary to determine the condition of the property and an estimated market value. If the taxes are paid the Servicing Office will demand payment from the borrower. If payment is not made a foreclosure action will pursue.  \n \n13.4 SPECIAL  SERVICING  ACTIONS  \n \nA. Borrower  Counseling  \n \nIf a borrower notifies Field Staff that there may be a problem with loan  repayment, Field \nStaff  must  not offer special  servicing  options  or counsel  the borrower  about  specific alternatives. \nInstead, Field Staff should help the borrower place a call to the Servicing Office to obtain this type of assistance.  \n \n \n13-9 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL  PN \nRevised  (03-09-22) SPECIAL PN",
  "page_10": " \n  \nHB-1-3550  \nParagraph  13.4 Special  Servicing  Actions  \n \nIt is important  for Field  Staff  to understand the servicing  tools  available to the Servicing \nOffice in order to be able to refer borrowers most effectively. However, it is the responsibility \nof the Servicing  Office  to provide  specific  information  and counseling to borrowers.  Field  Staff \nmust use extreme caution in providing information to borrowers, since detailed information about changes in servicing procedures will be disseminated primarily at the Servicing Office.  \n \nThe Rural  Development  portion of a leveraged/participation  loan is eligible  for the same \nservicing actions as Section 502 and 504 loans. However, servicing strategies may be different because of the Agency\u2019s lien position and the need to coordinate servicing actions with the leveraged/participation lender.  \n \nThe Servicing Office has the primary responsibility of servicing these accounts. On \noccasion, it may be necessary to request the Field Office to provide information on the leveraged/participation lender that is otherwise not available. Likewise, if the leveraged/participation  lender  contacts  the Field  Office  regarding  a specific  account,  they may \nwish to refer the lender to the Servicing Office for assistance.  \n \nB. Protective Advances  \n \nWhen  the Servicing  Office  is contemplating  a protective  advance  for physical  repairs \nbased on a borrower\u2019s report that the  property is in need of repairs, Field Staff  may be  asked \nto visit the property to determine whether the repair is actually needed, and whether the condition of the property warrants additional investment. The Servicing Office also may request that Field Staff conduct inspections of work completed with a pr otective advance.  \n \nField  Staff  who notice  significant  damage or deterioration  in a property that secures  an \nAgency loan should report that information to the Servicing Office. The Servicing Office can then contact the borrower to discuss the condition of the property and determine whether additional action is warranted. Potential contamination from hazardous substances, hazardous wastes, or petroleum products should be reported promptly to the State Environmental Coordinator for further evaluation and guidance.  \n \nC. Refinancing  \n \nBorrowers with Agency nonprogram loans (nonprogram assumptions or credit sales), \nabove -moderate  loans,  or initial Section  502 program  loans  with a term less than 25 years  are not \neligible for payment subsidy. If a borrower with one of these types of loans experiences \ndifficulty, is in danger of losing the home, and it appears that the borrower would otherwise qualify for payment subsidy, Field Staff may be asked by the Servicing Office to consider refinancing the loan.  \n \n \n13-10 ",
  "page_11": " \n HB-1-3550  \nParagraph  13.4 Special  Servicing  Actions  \n \nAgency  debt, including subsidy recapture,  may be refinanced  as a special  servicing  action \nincluding, but  not limited  to, at  the end of a moratorium. When  an existing  Agency  loan  is being \nrefinanced as a special servicing action, the household\u2019s adjusted income must not exceed the \napplicable moderate- income limit for the area at the time of loan approval and closing.  The \nAgency may limit the number of direct loans made for refinancing purposes based on the availability of funds and Agency priorities.  \nD. Subsequent  Loans  \n \nOriginating  subsequent  loans  is always  the responsibility  of Field  Staff.  However,  there \nmay be times when the Servicing Office becomes aware the borrower may need a subsequent loan and will refer the borrower to the Field Office. \n \nE. Bankruptcies  \n \nIf a borrower\u2019s  bankruptcy petition  is received  in the Field  Office,  it should be forwarded \nimmediately to the Servicing Office.  \n \nF. Missing  Borrowers  \n \nWhen the Servicing Office is unable to locate a borrower, Field Staff may be asked to \nuse local  connections  in an effort  to find them.  This might  include  checking  with neighbors  or \nfriends, contacting local utilities, or checking with area schools. If the borrower cannot be located, Field Staff may be asked to take custody of the property to protect the Government\u2019s interest.  \n \nProcedures  for managing  custodial  property are described  in Chapter  15 of this Handbook.  \n \nG. Payment  Subsidy  Renewals  \n \nPayment subsidy renewals are the responsibility of the Servicing Office. On occasion, it \nmay be necessary to request that the Field Office make a personal contact with the borrower to assist  with the payment  subsidy renewal  process. Personal  contact  by the field is necessary  when \nthe Servicing Office has not received required documentation from the borrower to renew the payment subsidy and the Servicing Office has been unable to make a personal contact. A personal  contact  is made  when  verbal  communication is made with the borrower  either  by phone \nor through a face -to-face meeting or through written communication from the borrower.  \n \n \n \n \n13-11 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL  PN \nRevised  (03-09-22) SPECIAL PN  \n \n ",

For the Agency, a sale to another party avoids the potential costs of liquidation, as well as costs related to owning and disposing of a property. For the borrower, it offers the best opportunity for being released from the debt without a major credit history blemish. A borrower may sell a property to a third party even afte r the account is \naccelerated. Field Offices may become aware of a borrower who desires to sell their property through notification  from  the Servicing  Office  or directly  from  the borrower. If the initial contact \nwas not made through the Servicing Office, the Field Office should notify the Servicing Office of the proposed sale. If it appears that the sale of the property may not pay the debt in full, the Field Office should provide the borrower with a Debt Settlement Packet. \nIf a borrower proposes to sell the property for an amount which may be insufficient to \npay the Agency  debt, prior  liens,  and authorized  selling  expenses,  the Agency may consent  to the \nsale when it is determined to be in the best interests of the Agency. The  Agency  may also \nadvance  authorized selling expenses to facilitate the sale. To determine if the proposed sale is in \nthe Agency\u2019s best interest, a copy of the sales contract, appraisal, and sales expenses are needed. Another lender\u2019s appraisal may be used if it meets Agency appraisal guideli nes. \n  \n \n13-14 ",

The homeowner  is to be made  fully  aware that \nwhile the Agency is agreeing to release the lien,  they are still responsible for any remaining \ndebt, which can be settled through the debt settlement process.  \nThe denial  letter  should state,  at a minimum,  that the Agency  has reviewed  the request  for \nconsent to sell the property for the proposed sale price and provide specific reasons why the Agency does not consent to the sale. The Field Office should be listed as the contact.  \nIn cases  where a  junior  lien exists,  the State  Director  may approve  settlement of  a junior \nlien to effect  sale of the property  when  it is determined  to be in the Agency\u2019s  best interest.  Field \nStaff will negotiate the lowest cost to have the junior lien released from the security property, \nbearing in mind the Agency only seeks to have the lien released (and not necessarily satisfied). The junior lienholder may still seek recovery from the debtor, if permitted by State law. \n \nThe Agency\u2019s objective is to \nminimize any potential loss to the Government and to the borrower. The \nAgency may consent to a sale for as low as the market value of the property, minus the prior liens and authorized sales expenses. When  the proposed  sales  price is less than the \nmarket value, a net recovery valuation is required. Either action is handled in the Field Office and the final decision to concur with the proposed sale lies with  a Loan  Approval Official.  \n \n  \n \n \n \n13-15 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL  PN \nRevised  (03-09-22) SPECIAL PN  \n  \n \n \n \n Example  - Sale for Less Than Debt  \n \nA borrower\u2019s  debt is $30,000,  the sales  price  of the \nproperty is $28,000, authorized sales expenses are  \n$3,000, and the market value is $28,000.  In this case, \nthe Loan  Approval  Official may consent  to the proposed \nsale since it will net the Agency $25,000 ($28,000  \nminus $3,000 in authorized selling expenses).

Since these actions involve security property, they are \nhandled in Field Offices. Key actions that require approval from the Agency include subordination, lease of mineral rights, partial  release of security, lease of security property, and \nassumption of indebtedness. \n \nWhen  the Servicing Office becomes  aware of borrower  actions  requiring approval, they \nwill cue the local  Field  Office  and provide  any necessary  information  to facilitate  processing of \nthe borrower\u2019s request. Field Offices will approve or disapprove the actions outlined in this section and will cue the Servicing Office with the outcome. \n \nThis section  first covers  general  guidelines  and procedures  for evaluating  a borrower\u2019s \nrequest  for approval of  an action, with the exception of assumptions of  indebtedness. Specific \nguidelines for each of the actions, including assumptions, follow the discussion of general guidelines.  \n \n13.9 GENERAL  GUIDELINES  \n \nA. Reviewing  Requests  \n \nTo request approval for subordination, mineral leases, partial release of security, and \nlease of security property, a borrower must submit Form RD 465- 1, Application for Partial \nRelease,  Subordination, or Consent. If the information provided is not sufficient  to allow  for a \nthorough evaluation, the Field Office must request additional information from the borrower.  \n \nB. Obtaining  an Appraisal  and an Environmental  Review  \n \nAn appraisal  is required  for the Agency  to subordinate  its interests  or to approve  a partial \nrelease of security  if the amount  of consideration exceeds  $5,000. The borrower  must  pay for the \nappraisal, although the cost for an appraisal can be charged to the borrower\u2019s account. \n \nAn existing appraisal may be used if it is less than 1 year old and appears to reflect \nmarket  value.  An Agency  appraisal  is not required  if a lender  is involved and can provide  an \nappraisal that adequately reflects market value.  \n \n \n \n13-18 ",

Evaluating and Approving  the Request  \n \nOnce the information  needed  to evaluate the request  has been  submitted,  the Field  Office \nmust analyze the effect of the proposed action on the security property and document the \nconclusions on Form RD 465- 1. Some factors to consider in the analysis include:  \n\u2022 The market  value  of the property before  and after  the transaction;  \n\u2022 The physical  effects  of the action  on the security  property;  and \n\u2022 The assignment  of initial and subsequent  payment  proceeds.  \nIf the analysis  indicates  that the Agency\u2019s  security  will not be put at risk by the action,  an \napproval official may sign Form RD 465- 1. The Office of the General Counsel (OGC) or the \nState Office may need  to provide relevant forms needed to complete the  approval.

Such requests are rare but do occur in situations such as a property in a town located above a coal mine or a property located on a water source. OGC shoul d be involved in \nmineral  lease decisions because State  and local  laws vary. In  addition, an environmental review \nis required in accordance with RD Instruction 1970 series \u201cEnvironmental\u201d, prior to approval. Subordination of an Agency loan to a mineral lease does not entitle the leaseholder to any proceeds  from the sale of the security property. If the  lease of mineral rights is approved, rental \nproceeds not assigned to the Agency are treated as income and any payment subsidy must be adjusted accordingly. \n \nThe Agency should consent to the lease of mineral rights and the subordination of its \nliens  to the lessee\u2019s  rights and interests  in the mineral activity  if the security  property will remain \nsuitable as a residence, and the Government\u2019s security interest will not be adversely affected.  \n \nTo make this determination, the Agency must consider the effects of leasing on the \nsecurity  property including the potential for the lessee\u2019s  rights of surface  entry  on the property. \nThe Agency  also must ensure that the property remains  decent,  safe, and sanitary  and the value \nof the security property is not decreased below the amount of the loan. \n \n\u2022 No decrease in value. If the proposal is not likely to decrease the value of the \nsecurity  property, the lease  may be approved if the borrower agrees:  (1) to use any \ndamage compensation received from the lessee to repair damage to the site or dwelling; or (2) to assign it to the Agency to be applied to reduce principal.  \n \n \n13-21 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL  PN \nRevised  (02-02-18) PN 508",

Advances will bear interest at the promissory note rate of the loan against which \nthey are charged. Advances for borrowers with multiple loans secured by the same property should be charged against the largest loan.  \n \n1. Determining  the Need  for Repairs  \n \nThe need  for repairs  may be identified  by the borrower,  Field  Office,  or the Servicing \nOffice. Field Offices are responsible for completing an inspection of the property, \ndeveloping a description of the work required, preparing a cost estimate, and approving the protective advance.  \n \n2. Alternative  Sources  of Funding  \n \nBefore processing the advance, the Field Office \nmust first determine whether it appears that the borrower qualifies for a subsequent loan. If a subsequent loan appears feasible, a loan application will be processed immediately. If the need  for a \nprotective  advance is so urgent, clearly  \napparent that the borrower would not qualify for a loan, is uncooperative, or that a protective  \nadvance is  more appropriate, the Field Office  must document  why  alternatives were not \nfeasible and why the repairs are needed to protective the Government\u2019s interest when processing an advance.

After acceleration and \nany ensuing appeals, the case is sent to the State Office for completion of the liquidation. Once \nlegal proceedings have concluded, the property will be sold at a fore closure sale. To complete \nthe foreclosure process, the State Office must determine how much to bid and enter that bid at the sale. A net recovery valuation is required. Estimated net recovery value represents the amount that the Agency could expect to recover from a property if it was liquidated after considering all costs  associated  with liquidating, holding, and selling  the property. Handbook-2- \n3550, Attachment  6-A contains  a net recovery  value worksheet to aid in this calculation.  Actual \nnet recovery value is the amount the Agency in fact does recover from the sale of a property, after accounting for all costs.  \n \n13.17  NET  RECOVERY VALUE  \n \nA. Establishing  Market  Value  \n \nThe market value of the property is the \nfundamental basis for establishing the estimated net recovery  value.  All calculations  undertaken on the net \nrecovery value worksheet provide additions or deductions from market value. In no case will a  \n\u201cdistressed sale\u201d or similar reduced value be used, resulting in a \u201cdouble discount\u201d and less recovery for the Government. Costs of liquidation and ownership are considered as deductions from  the market  value in the net recovery  value calculation.  Conversely, likely  major  costs,  such \nas lead -based paint assessment and abatement on an older home or other major repairs, must be \nincluded to accurately determine the Government\u2019s costs of ownership. \n \nB. Environmental Considerations  \n \nThe estimate of market value must take into consideration potential environmental \nhazards that may pose a liability issue for the Agency and the presence of environmental resources for which the Agency will have an affirmative responsibility to take protec tive \nmeasures  once it owns the property. Exhibit 13-3 of this Chapter provides a partial  list of \nenvironmental factors for consideration. \n \nIn order to minimize Agency liability, the Agency must ensure, prior to acquiring \nproperty through foreclosure, that the property has been examined for potential contamination from  hazardous substances,  hazardous wastes,  and petroleum products, including underground \n \n \n13-29 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL PN  \nRevised ( 03-09-22) SPECIAL PN  \n Calculation  of Net Recovery  Value  \n \nMarket  value  (less)  Costs \n(plus) Income  \nNet recovery  value  ",

The Acceleration  Notice  \n \nIf the Servicing Office determines that the appropriate approach to liquidation is \nforeclosure, the process begins with an acceleration notice. The acceleration notice \ndemands full payment of the account including unpaid principal and interest,  advances, \nand subsidy subject to recapture. It notifies the borrower of: (1) the reason for the \nacceleration;  (2) the amount due; (3) the method of payment; (4) the opportunity for an \ninformal discussion with the decision maker; and (5) the process for requesting an administrative appeal hearing. The notice gives the borrower 30 days to pay in full or \nrequest a hearing.  \n \nThe notice must be sent to the borrower and any cosigners simultaneously  by both \nregular mail and certified mail. If the property address is different from the address of the borrower, the notice should be sent to the property address as well. \n \n2. Treatment  of Payment Subsidy  \n \nIf a borrower is  receiving payment subsidy, the payment subsidy agreement will not \nbe canceled  when  the debt is  accelerated,  but the agreement  will not be renewed  when  it \nexpires unless the account is reinstated.  \n \n3. Special  Servicing  \n \nAfter  a borrower\u2019s  account  has been  accelerated,  the borrower is no longer eligible \nfor any of the special servicing actions described in Chapter 5. \n \n4. Assignment  of Security  Instruments  \n \nAssignment of promissory notes and security instruments is authorized when an \naccount has been accelerated, all appeals have been exhausted, the case has been accepted  by OGC  for foreclosure,  and the Agency  is being paid at least the net recovery \nvalue of the security property. \n5. Offers  to Pay \n \nField  Offices  will refer offers  to cure the default  to the Servicing  Office.  The \nborrower is permitted to cure the default and retain the loan under the following conditions:  \n________________________________________________________________ \n13-37 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL  PN \nRevised ( 03-09-22) SPECIAL PN  ",

If appropriate, the \nState/Field Office will interact with the Office of the General Counsel/U.S. Attorney\u2019s office  to determine  if a cure can be accepted  and document  the recommendation  in global \nnotes. State/Field Offices may calculate the cure amount or if assistance is needed, contact the Servicing Office, SFH Assistance Section . All funds to cure an account must \nbe certified or remitted using electronic funds (Western Union Quick Collect or Money Gram). The use of Customer Initiated Payments (CIP) or \u201ccheck by phone\u201d will not be used to cure an account, as these funds are not gu aranteed.  \n \nWhen an offer is made to pay less than the full amount to cure the default, \nAttachment 13 -C must be completed. The attachment, including concurrence by the \nState Director will be sent to the Deputy Administrator, the Servicing Office, for approval  along with any supporting documentation. A request  to reamortize  the account \nmust also be submitted at this time if the borrower is unable to pay the shortage within 30 days from acceptance of the offer. The request for approval of the offer should be submitted to  the Servicing Office, SFH Assistance Section . \nIf approved, the State/Field  Office  will submit  the certified  funds  agreed  upon along \nwith a payment assistance package (if payment assistance has expired). If the borrower can pay the shortage  within  30 days  and a reamortization  is not necessary,  this should be \nnoted on the funds transmittal. The State/Field Office is responsible for ensuring the borrower pays the approved cure amount as agreed. If the account is reamortized, an escrow will be established, if not already in place.  \n \nWhen  the State/Field  Office determines  it is not in the best interest  of the Agency  to \naccept a cure, Task #802 will be sent to the Servicing Office to have the account coded to prevent future cures.

The lockbox address is USDA/RHS, P.O. Box \n790300, St. Louis, MO 63179.

Review  of the Acceleration  Decision  \nSeveral  remedies  are available to borrowers  who believe their accounts  should not have \nbeen accelerated. These include an informal administrative review at the Servicing Office, mediation or a formal appeal with the NAD. Chapter 1 , Paragraph 1.9 of this Handbook \ndescribes the appeal and review process in detail.  \n \nD. Initiating  Legal  Proceedings  \nField  Offices  should continue  the foreclosure  process  30 days after  the acceleration  notice \nis sent if the borrower does not request an informal review  or appeal the acceleration decision, or \nas soon as NAD upholds the Agency\u2019s decision to foreclose.  \n \nThe Agency  will only seek a deficiency  judgment  (in those  States  where available)  when \nforeclosure is initiated,  and the Agency determines the borrower has or will have assets from \nwhich a deficiency judgment could be recovered. Deficiency judgments will never be sought in the following situations: (1) acceleration is due to an unpaid recapture amount; (2) the borrower was granted a moratorium at any time during the course of the loan and faithfully tried to meet \nthe loan obligations; (3) State law does not permit a personal deficiency; (4) in nonjudicial \nforeclosure States, the United States Attorney will not accept  a referral for the deficiency; or (5) the \nAgency has determined after consultation with OGC that it is not cost effective to seek a deficiency on a particular case.  \n \n13-39 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL PN  \nRevised ( 11-06-24) PN 628  ",

This offer is made \nafter the account has been accelerated, the appeals process has been concluded and the case sent to \nthe respective State Office.  \n \nE. The Foreclosure Sale \nOnce legal proceedings have concluded, the property will be sold at a foreclosure sale. To \ncomplete  the foreclosure process,  Field  Offices must  determine  how much  to bid and enter  that bid at \nthe sale.  \n \n1. Establishing  a Bid Amount  \nThe Agency\u2019s bid will be the lesser  of the Agency\u2019s gross investment or the estimated  net \nrecovery value of the security property. \nGross investment is the sum of: \n\u2022 The unpaid balance,  defined as: \n\u25ca In states  with judicial  foreclosure, the judgment account established  as a result of the \nforeclosure judgment. \n\u25ca In states  with non-judicial  foreclosure, the borrower\u2019s account balance reflecting \nsecured loans and advances. \n\u2022 All outstanding  advances and fees charged  to the borrower\u2019s account. \n\u2022 Total subsidy  received.  \n\u2022 Bidding  at the Foreclosure Sale \nProcedures for bidding at a sale will vary by locality and a local presence may be \nrequired. If the Agency is the high bidder, the property will become REO property, which will be managed and disposed of by the Field Office. In order to acquire the property through the LoanServ System, send Task #229 to the Servicing Office noting the Agency \nwas the successful bidder at the sale. The Servicing Office will  then create the foreclosure \ntemplate  to allow  the field to acquire the property. The Field  Office will be responsible for \nupdating the tasks on the template. \nIf the amount received  through the foreclosure sale is less than the borrower\u2019s \noutstanding debt,  the Servicing Office  will handle the debt settlement procedures.  \n \n \n \n \n \n   \n13-40 ",
