  "page_1": " \n  \n \n15.1 OVERVIEW  \n \nThe Agency assumes management responsibility for 2 types of properties: custodial and \nreal estate owned (REO). Custodial property is borrower -owned property which has been \nabandoned. REO is Agency- owned property t o which the Agency has acquired title, either as a \nresult of foreclosure or conveyance by deed in lieu of foreclosure. This chapter outlines the \nrequirements for management of each type of property.  \nCurrent responsibilities of on -site management activities are split between the Field \nOffices and the Servicing and Asset Management Office (Servicing Office) during the \nliquidation process for custodial properties. The Servicing Off ice continues to be responsible for \nthe financial management.  \nResponsibilities f or oversight of on -site management is now referred to the Responsible \nParty. The Responsible Party may be both the Servicing Office, the Field Office or an independent authoriz ed government contractor.  \nThe goal of property management is to protect the Gove rnment\u2019s interest; consequently, \nefforts to secure property should begin as soon as the Agency has control.  \n \nSECTION 1: PROPERTY MANAGEMENT METHODS AND ACTIVITIES  \n \n15.2 MANAGEMENT M ETHODS AND CONTRACTS  \nThe Agency may conduct the management activities discussed in this chapter using \nAgency staff or may contract with qualified entities to perform them. The method of management depends on such factors as the number of properties to be managed, their location, condition, the necessary maintenance, and the availabili ty of qualified staff. In some cases, a simple maintenance \ncontract is all that is needed; in others, the Agency may require a complete management contract where a contractor provides all property management services, including, but not necessarily \nlimited  to securing and cleaning up the structure, yard work, arranging for and inspecting repairs, \npaying utilities, and coordinating with contractors, potential buyers or brokers for access to the property.  \nA. Selecting a Management  Contractor  \nManagement contracto rs must be selected in accordance with Agency procurement procedures \nunder RD Instruction 2024- A. \n \n \n15-1 \n(01-23-03)  SPECIAL PN  \nRevised ( 03-09-22)  SPECIAL PN  \nCHAPTER 15: MANAGING CUSTODIAL AND \nREO PROPERTY HB-1-3550  ",
  "page_2": " \n HB-1-3550 \nParagraph 15.2 Management Methods and Contracts  \n \nB. Management Contract Requirements \n \nAt a minimum, management contracts must:  \n \n\u2022 Allow for properties to be added or removed from the contractor\u2019s assignment, \nwhenever necessar y, such as when a property is taken into custody, acquired or sold \nduring the period of a contract; and \n \n\u2022 Prohibit the pre parer or his/her associates from doing any of the repair work when a \ncontract calls for specification writing  services.  \n \nIf a contract includes marketing or broker services and involves management of 5 or more \nsingle family homes in the same subdivision, t he contractor must develop and obtain Agency \napproval of an Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan, as  described in RD Instru ction 1901- E. \nThe contracting official approves the plan, however, any questions that might arise with respect to \nan Affirmative F air Housing Marketing Plan should be directed to the Civil Rights Coordinator in \nthe State Office.  \n \n15.3 TAKING  POSSESSION  \n \nA. Taking  Custodial Possession  \n \nThe Agency may need to take custody of security property when a borrower becomes \nincapacitated, dies or has abandoned a security property. When the Servicing Office  is unable to \ncontact a borrower, the Responsible Party will be reque sted to inspect the property to determine \nits status and to attempt to contact the borrower.  When the Field Office believes that a  property \nmay be abandoned, it will report to the Servicing Office . \n \n1. Determining Whether A Property Has Been  Abandoned  \n \nThe d etermination that a property has been abandoned requires significant \ninvestigation and documentation.  In addition to the  actions described in this \nparagraph, the Responsible Party  must follow any procedures required by State or \nlocal law in order to confirm the determination of abandonment and to take custodial possession. A property is not considered abandoned if the borrower occupi es the \nproperty, even if it is not being well maintained. Similarly, a property is not considered abandoned when the borrower  does not occupy the dwelling but has made \narrangements for its care. The Agency cannot act to obtain possession of a property as long as a lien holder has possession of the property, or the borrower or the lien holder \nhas a right to lease proceeds.  As a minimum, the Responsible Party  must:  \n \n15-2 ",

Recommendation for Taking  Custody  \n \nThe Responsible Party will submit a repor t of its finding to the Servicing Office  with a \ncopy to the State Director advising that it appears the property has been abandoned and the \nAgency needs to assume responsibility for it in order to protect the security. Alternatively, if the Responsible Par ty reports that the property is occupied, the report will give details as \nto whether the occupant is under a lease or is unauthorized. The Responsible Party  will \nprovide any other relevant details and make the decision to take custodial possession of the property, as appropriate.  The Responsibl e Party  will notify the Servicing Office  when \nthe action has been taken.  \n \n3. Liquidation  \n \nThe need to take custodial possession of a property may occur before or after a loan has \nbeen accelerated. If liquidation is not already in progress, taking custodial possession should initiate the process. The responsibility for conducting liquidation act ivities remains \nwith the Servicing Office , supported by Field Office staff as required.  \n \nB. Acquisition of an REO Property  \n \nOnce the Agency acquires a property a new  REO case file should be created f rom the \noriginal case file by removing and placing into the new file the title to the property, and recent inspection reports, appraisals, or other documentation related to the physical condition or value of the property.  No information related to the borrower is needed in the REO file.  Any documents relating to due diligence and response actions (clean- up activities) should also be placed in the \nREO file; however, these documents must be retained indefinitely to minimize Agency liability and should be so labeled.  \n15-3 ",
  "page_4": "15-4  \n  \n15.4 INSPECTING AND SECURING CUSTODIAL AND REO  PROPERTY  \n \nInspection should be made of acquired property as soon as feasible after the foreclosure \nsale or other means of acquisiti on\u2014usually within seven days. The Responsible Party must \ninspect the property to:  \n \n\u2022 Determine what steps need to be taken to further ensure its security and maintain its \nvalue.  \n\u2022 Identify  whether  the property  is occupied  and, if occupied, the intent of the occupants.  \n\u2022 Classify the property as program and nonprogram and evaluate the need for  repairs.  \nA. Inspecting and Classifying the Property [7 CFR  3550.251(c)(1)]  \n \nThe Responsible Party must designate REO property as program or nonprogram (NP) \nproperty after consi dering factors such as size, design, possible health and/or safety hazards, and \nobsolescence due to functional, economic, or locational  conditions. A property that meets the \nrequirements for program property, as described in Chapter 5, is classified as pro gram property. \nProperty that has been enlarged or improved, so that its value is clearly above program standards, \nor a property that would require major redesign or renovation to be brought to program standards, should be classified as NP property. REO property in an area no longer designated rural is treated as if it were still in a rural area.  \n \nFor program property, a listing of needed repairs or improvements will be prepared. For \nNP properties, a listing should be prepared of any health and safety hazards which must be removed to release deed restriction. Repairs, if required, are typically a condition of sale and repair lists should be  incorporated with the sale listing for all REO.  \n \nIf the REO is occupied, preparation of the repair list may need to be delayed until the \nproperty is vacated, depending on the cooperation of the occupants. In this case, the status of the property should be monitored regularly. \n \nThe basis for classification as program or nonprogram must be thoroughly documented. \nImproper clas sification of the REO could result in an unsound loan if, for example, the remaining \nlife of the property is less than the term of the loan. (A manufactured home with 15 -20 years \nremaining life is not sound security for a subsidized loan with a minimum ter m of 25 years.) \nClassification as NP may significantly reduce the amount the Government could recover (especially if the REO i s then leased) or could deprive a program -eligible family of an affordable \nhome.

Securing Custodial and REO  Property  \n \nWhen the Agency assumes management responsibility and takes possession of either a \ncustodial or REO property, immediate steps must be taken to inspect and secure the property \nwhether by the R esponsible Party.  \n \n1. Physical Security of Vacant Properties  \n \nIf the property is vacant, it should be locked or otherwise secured and a no trespassing \nnotice should be posted to prevent entry by unauthorized persons. For REO only, after an inspection determines utility systems are in safe operable condition, utility companies should be contacted to maintain or reinstate utility service. An inventory should be made of any nonsecurity personal property left on the premises and efforts made to identify any owner s or lien holders.  \n \n2. Occupied REO Properties  \n \nREO property may be occupied by a tenant under a lease with the former borrower or \nby the borrower. The Agency may decide to honor an existing lease if it is in the Government\u2019s interest, or it may have to evict an unauthorized tenant.  \n \nWhen an REO property is under an existing lease and the Agency decides to continue \nthe lease, the lessee must be notified, in writing, that the Agency has acquired the former lessor\u2019s rights under the lease and that all payments should be remitted to the Servicing Office . If a lease is to be terminated, the lessee must be notified, in writing, that their \nlease is being terminated in 30 days , and they must vacate.  \n \nLease payments due, payable, and received before the date the Agency  acquired the \nproperty are applied to the borrower\u2019s account. If there is a surplus, it is refunded to the former borrower. Lease payments due and payable after the date the Agency acquired the property are applied to a lease account established by the Ser vicing Office  in the name of the \nlessee.  \n \nThe Office of the General Counsel (OGC) should be contacted for advice and \nassistance when it is necessary to evict a tenant in order to obtain possession of REO property particularly if it is leased.  A State Supp lement will provide explicit instructions.  \n \n15.5 DISPOSITION OF NONSECURITY PROPERTY  \nThe Agency has no legal claim on nonsecurity property.

The Responsible Party must comply with any State or local \nrequirements, as well as the procedures discussed in this paragraph. If the owner or lien holder of any personal property that remains in custodial or REO property can be identified and located, the \nResponsible Party must offer them a reasonable opportunity to remove the property. Any verbal conversations with the owner of the property should be confirmed in writ ing. \n \nA. Custodial Property  \n \nThe Agenc y cannot remove nonsecurity personal property from custodial properties, unless \nit cannot be safely stored, there are hazards that threaten the personal property (such as a leaking roof), or the personal property itself p resents a hazard (such as flammables or explosives).  \n \nB. REO Property  \n \n1. Notice to Owners or Lien Holders of Personal  Property  \n \nIf the property is not retrieved after the initial notification, a certified letter should be \nsent, return receipt requested, notifying the owner or lien holder of the date on which the \nAgency will dispose of the property, that the property may be retrieved before the disposition upon payment of any expenses incurred by the Agency related to the personal property, such as advertisement or storage.  \n \n2. Disposal of Unclaimed  Property  \n \nThe Responsible Party will dispose of unclaimed property in accordance with its \nvalue and conforming with local practices. For example, if there are items of significant value, an advertisement may be placed in the local newspaper.  \n \n3. Income from  Disposition  \n \nProceeds from the s ale of items under lien should be paid to any owner or lien holder \nafter deducting Agency selling expenses. If there is no known owner or lien holder, proceeds are applied to the REO account. \n \n15.6 TAXES AND INSURANCE  \n \nA.

The Responsible Party  will \nnotify the taxing authority, in writing, when title to real estate is  acquired  \nParagraph 15.6  Taxes and Insurance  \n \nand provide the Servicing Office  address to which tax bills should be sent during Agency ownership.  \n \nIf the value of the property is significantly less than the value at which it is being taxed, as \nsoon as i t is acquired, the Agency may request a new assessment by the local taxing authority.  \n \nIf property is acquired subject to a prior lien, before the Agency pays taxes, the \nResponsible Party will contact the prior lien holder to determine if that lien holder will pay the taxes.  Taxes on program property are paid when due. Taxes on nonprogram property may be deferred until the property is sold if the taxes that accrue before disposition may ex ceed the value \nof the property. If the taxing authority schedules a tax sale before the Agency can sel l the property, \nthe Responsible Party should calculate and compare the net recovery values that would result from \npaying the taxes and continuing sales ef forts or letting the property be sold for delinquent taxes to \ndetermine which approach is in the Gover nment\u2019s best interest. See Handbook- 2-3550, \nAttachment 6 -A for a net recovery value worksheet.  \n \nB. Insurance \n \n1. Custodial Property  \n \nInsurance on custodial property w ill not be canceled. The Agency will not pay \nadditional premiums to continue coverage.  \n \n2. REO Prop erty \n \nInsurance will not be canceled when property is acquired.

Refer to RD \nInstruction 1970 series \u201cEnvironmental\u201d for further direction.  \n \nWhen certain environmental resources are p resent, or when certain extraordinary \ncircumstances exist, specific limitations or con straints are imposed by environmental law on the \nAgency\u2019s repair and maintenance, selling and leasing activities. In such cases, an Environmental \nAssessment (EA) rather t han a categorical exclusion, may be required to address the situation \nproperly. Consul tation with RD Instruction 1970 series \u201cEnvironmental\u201d, as well as the State \nEnvironmental Coordinator, is recommended  before  proceeding in the following circum stances.  \n \nA.

Historic and Archaeological  Resources  \n \nProperties that are listed or eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places, \nin whole or in part, will be repaired as neces sary to protect their historic integrity after \nconsulta tion with the State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) and the Advisory Council on \nHistoric Pr eservation. If a property is listed or eligible for listing on the Register and also is \nlocated within th e CBRS, the property cannot be repaired without the pri or approval of the \nUSFWS.  \n \nThe Responsible Party will review the current Register to determine if the property is \nlisted. If the property is not listed, the Responsible Party  will consult with the SHPO  when the \nproperty is considered potentially eligible f or the Register. A property is considered potentially \neligible if it contains a structure more than 50 years of age or, regardless of age, if the property is \nknown to be of historic or archeological im portance, or has apparent significant architectural \nfeatures.  \n \nAdditionally, for properties located on Tribal land or in Indian country, consultation w ill \nbe made with the Tribal Historic Preservation Officer (THPO) to determine if the property is \nknown to be of historic or archeological importance.  \n \n3. Floodplai ns and Wetlands  \n \nIf the Agency is considering a substantial improvement or repair to custodial o r REO \nproperty located in a flood plain or wetland, the Agency must first consider whether there \nare practicable alternatives to such further investment in the floodplain or wetland area. \nFor example: \n \n\u2022 Could the property be sold \u201cas is\u201d with notice of floodplain/wetland  hazard?  \n\u2022 Could the property be sold \u201cas is\u201d with a requirement that the structure be re moved \nfrom the  site? \n \n\u2022 Could the Agency remove the structur e first and sell the land with notice of  hazard?  \n \n HB-1-3550  ",

The cost of compliance with \nhealth, sanitary and safety codes is not included in the calculation of the substantial improvem ent \ncost, nor is the cost of repair to an historic structure included. If the repairs do not qua lify as \nsubstantial, the Agency does not need to search for alternatives or mitigation measures.  \n \n4. Reportable Underground Storage  Tanks  \nProperties that contain c ertain types of underground storage  tanks must be reported to \nthe State agency identified by the  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) within 30 \ndays of Agency acquisition.

However, in special cases, such as \nwhen custodial proper ty is subject to lengthy liquidation proceedings or legal problems prohibit the \nimmediate sale of an REO property, the property may be leased. Custodial propert y cannot be \nleased if extensive repairs are necessary in order for it to be inhabitable. Propert ies subject to \nredemption rights cannot be leased unless the Responsible Party obtains prior approval from OGC. \nProperty which does not meet de cent, safe and sa nitary standards will not be leased.  \nIt is preferable to lease the property to an intended buyer . The Agency may require a \nprospective renter to make a purchase offer, and submit an application for credit and a credit report paid for by the applicant. The rent charged should be a market rent equivalent to rents of similar properties in the area. If t he lessee is a program applicant, the monthly rent may be based on the \nestimated monthly loan payment taking into consideration any payment ass istance, plus 1/12 the \nsum of the estimated real estate taxes, property insurance, and maintenance payable by a homeowner. In no case will a lease be for a token amount, even if the tenant is willing to barter for maintenance or repair services.  \nA lease fo rm approved by OG C will be used. A copy of the lease should be sent to the \nServicing Office , where a lease accoun t will be established in the lessee\u2019s name.  \nWhen a lease is terminated, or when the property is sold before expiration of the term \nshown on the  lease submitted to the Servicing Office , the Responsible Party must notify the \nServicing Office  of the termination and the effective date of the termination. \nA. Security Deposits  \nThe Agency requires a security deposit of one month\u2019s rent, except from nonprofit \norganizations or public bodies. Security deposits are remitted to the Servicing Office . When a \ntenant vacates the property, the Responsible Party  sends a memorandum to the Se rvicing Office  \nasking for the return of the deposit to the Responsible Party for delivery to the  lessee. If the \ndeposit is to be retained by the Agency, it is applied to the borrower\u2019s account  for custodial \nproperty or to the REO account, as appropriate.  \nB. Costs and  Income  \nExpenditures on leased custodial properties are charged to the borrower\u2019s  accoun t. \nExpenditures on REO property are charged to the REO account. The Agency does not pay utilitie s or any other costs of operation of leased property. Lease proc eeds for custodial \nproperties are applied to the borrower\u2019s account. Proceeds for custodial properties are applied to the borrower\u2019s account.  ",

Transitional Housing for th e Homeless  \n \nThe Agency has entered into a Memorandum of Understanding with the U.S. Department \nof Health and Human Services (HHS) (see Attachment 15 -B) that sta tes that HHS will direct \ncommunity groups to the Agency to identify specific REO properties that  may be available as \nshelter projects. REO property  may be leased for up to 10 years to nonprofit organizations as \ntransitional housing for the homeless for $1.00 with prior approval from the Deputy \nAdministrator, Single Family Housing in accordance with 4 2 U.S.C 11408a . The lessee assumes \nresponsibility f or real estate taxes on the leased property, any needed repairs to the property, and \nregular maintenance of t he property.  \n \nLeases executed under this program must make the local nonprofit organization responsible \nfor all liabilities and costs arising out o f the habitation of the property. The Agency must inspect \nthe property after the lease is executed to ensure that property is being maintained and used for its \nintended purposes.  Inspections should be mad e at least yearly thereafter.  \n \nAttachment 15- C incl udes a fact sheet that can be used by both the Agency and entities \ninterested in using REO property for the homeless and Attachment 15 -D contains a sample lease.  \n \nB. Use by Federal Emergency Management Agency  (FEMA)  \n \nBy a Memorandum of Understanding between the Agency and FEMA (see Attachment 15 - \nE), REO property which is not under lease or sales agreement is availa ble to shelter disaster \nvictims in an area designated as a major disaster area by the President.  In such an event, FEMA \nassumes responsibility for all costs associated with inhabiting the dwelling.  \n \nFEMA and the Agency must sign a \u201cLetter of Assignment,\u201d ( see Attachment 15 -F) which \nincludes a mutually agreed upon inspection report outlining the condi tion of the property being \nassigned to FEMA. Field Staff should retain the Letter of Assignment in the REO file. No rent is \npaid by FEMA for the first 12 months  from the date of the letter of assignment of the housing.  \nBeyond that, FEMA pays the monthly fa ir market rental value as de termined by the Agency. \n \nC. Mineral Leases  \n \nWhen it is in the best interest of the Government, the Agency may lease mineral rights.  \nOGC should be contacted for assistance in preparing the lease agreement. The appropriate level of environmental review must be completed prior to any agreement to lease mineral rights.  Since such actions may be controversial and may have the potential for s ignificant impact on the \nenvironment, prior consultation with the State Environmental Coordinato r is required.  ",

This Task Force, which includes \nrepresentation from several Government Agencies including the Rural Housing Service (RHS) (formerly FmHA), is responsible for dev elopi ng and examining Federal resources such as \nGovernment inventory properties which may be utilized by the homeless. A Memorandum of Understanding was establi shed between the Department of Agriculture and the Department of \nHealth and Human Services to make av ailable vacant single family houses, by lease, to public \nbodies and nonprofit organizations for transitional housing for the homeless. In lieu of cash rent , \nthe entity is required to maintain the property, pay real estate taxes and maintain property insura nce. \n \nRHS is committed to working with community based organizations in this regard to the \nextent practicable.  \n \nGeneral Guidelines  \n \n1.
