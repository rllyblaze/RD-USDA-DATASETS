  "page_28": "HB-3-3560 \nSECTION 2:  OVERVIEW OF THE \nAGENCY\u2019S MULTI -FAMILY HOUSING PROGRAMS  \n1.4   GOALS OF RHS MULTI -FAMILY HOUSING PROGRAMS  \nThe purpose of the Agency\u2019s Multi -Family Housing programs is to provide adequate, \naffordable, decent, safe, and sanitary rental units for very low -, low -, and moderate -income \nhouseholds in rural areas.  In providing this service, the Agency strives to meet several goals.  \n\u2022 Customer service.   The Agency is committed to providing customer -friendly, \nstreamlined service.  The Agency will administer its programs fairly and in \naccordance with both the letter and the spirit of all equal opportunity and fair housing legislation and applicable Execut ive Orders.  \n\u2022 Partnerships.   The Agency seeks to enhance its ability to serve eligible households \nby working with its partners, such as borrowers, property management agents, tenants, other lenders, nonprofit organizations, and State and Local agencies.  \n\u2022 Effective use of resources.   As publicly funded initiatives, the Agency\u2019s Multi -\nFamily Housing programs must use tax dollars efficiently.  The Agency aims to minimize administrative costs, underwrite loans responsibly, and leverage funding with private sources of credit to the exten t possible. \n1.5   SECTION 515 PROGRAM \u2014OVERVIEW  \nThe Section 515 direct loan program [7 CFR Part 3560] provides financing to support \nthe development of rental units in rural areas that need housing affordable for very low -, low -, \nand moderate -income households, and where this housing is unlikely to be provided through \nother means.  \nSection 515 loans can be used to build, acquire and rehabilitate, or improve dwellings in \nrural areas.  The term for loans is tied to the expected useful life of the property, and the standard term for an initial Section 515 loan is 30 years with a 50 -year amortization period.  However, the \nterm for subsequent loans and loans for special types of properties, such as manufactured housing, may be made for a shorter term based on the project\u2019s expected useful life.  \nEach loan is made at a note rate established by the Agency as prescribed in \nRD Instruction 440.1.  Borrowers approved for initial and/or subsequent loans receive interest credit that reduces the effective interest rate for the Agency\u2019s financing, thereby lowering the property\u2019s rents.  In  return for this below -market rate financing, the borrower agrees to lease the \nproject\u2019s rental units to income -eligible households at rents approved by the Agency. \n1.6  SECTION 514/516 PROGRAMS \u2014OVERVIEW  \nSection 514/516 direct loan and grant programs provide funds to support the development \nof adequate, affordable housing for farmworkers that is unlikely to be provided through other means.  \n1-5 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623  ",
  "page_29": "HB-3-3560 \nA.  Section 514 Loans and Section 516 Grants for Off -Farm Housing  \nSection 514 loans and Section 516 grants can be used for the same purposes as \nSection 515 loans to finance rental housing for farmworkers.  Unlike Section 515 \nprojects, off -farm labor housing projects may be built outside rural areas, as long as the \nprojec t addresses a need for affordable housing for farmworkers.  These projects are \neligible for financing at terms comparable to Section 515 loans, a grant to cover a significant share of the development cost, or a loan/grant combination finance package.  The maximum term for an Off- Farm Labor Housing loan is 33 years, and the effective \ninterest rate is 1 percent.   For Off- Farm Labor Housing grants, the grant period of \nperformance is five (5) years, which starts on the date the agreement is executed by the Agency and the grantee and ends five (5) years from the date the grant agreement is executed by the Agency and the grantee. The grant agreement will remain in effect for as \nlong as there is a need for the housing, as determined by the Agency. Tenants not only must be income eligible, but also receive priority based on the proportion of their income received from farm work.  \nB.  Section 514 Loans for On -Farm Housing  \nSection 514 loans can also be used to finance the development of adequate housing \nfor farmworkers involved in a specific farm operation \u2014On -Farm Labor Housing \nprojects.  These projects are treated as part of the farming operation, and the occupants do not pay shelter cost (rent & utilities) unless the shelter cost is approved by the Agency  \nLabor housing borrowers who are providing shelter for domestic farm housing that is \nrestricted for use by eligible residents supporting the borrower\u2019s farming operation may \nchoose to provide that housing to residents without imposing charges for rent or ut ilities \nor may choose to impose charges for rent, utilities, or rent and utilities subject to Agency approval.  All other labor housing borrowers who are providing shelter in support of \nfarming operations in the community at large are expected to operate t he program in \naccordance with Agency regulations governing the approval of charges for rent, utilities, \nor rent and utilities subject to Agency approval.  \n1-6 \n  ",

Prohibits discrimination in a Federally \nassisted program on the basis of age.  \n \n\u2022 Executive Order 11063 as Amended by Executive Order 12259.

Nondiscrimination  \nThe various civil rights laws prohibit the denial of loans, grants, services, and benefits \nprovided under the Section 515 and 514/516 programs to any person on the basis of race, \ncolor, national origin, sex, religion, marital status, familial status, age, physical or mental disability, or source of income, or because the applicant has, in good faith, exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 U.S.C. 1601).  Discrimination in employment pr actices also is prohibited.  These same requirements also apply to program \nparticipants.  Agency oversight of borrower compliance with civil rights laws is covered in Chapter 4 of HB -2-3560.  C omplaints filed by tenants will be  handled by the Agency \nin accordance with RD Instruction 2000- GGG and Attachment 1 -A. \nEffective management and consistent \nprocedures are good business practices that help ensure that all applicants are treated fairly.  Poor program implementation, whether discrimination is intended, has possible civil rights consequences.  \nB.  Reasonable Accommodations for Persons with Disabilities \nIn addition to avoiding discrimination, the Agency and loan and grant recipients must \nmake reasonable accommodations to permit persons with disabilities to apply for and benefit from Agency programs.  Reasonable accommodations may include providing modific ations to the dwellings and facilities so that they are physically accessible.  \nReasonable accommodations may also include effective communication and outreach tools so that all applicants can obtain program information (e.g., a Telecommunications Device f or the Deaf [TDD]).  \nC.  Limited English Proficiency [7 CFR 3560.2]  \nBorrowers and grantees must take reasonable steps to ensure that Limited English \nProficiency (LEP) persons receive the language assistance necessary to afford them meaningful access to USDA programs and activities, free of charge.  Failure to ensure that L EP persons can effectively participate in or benefit from federally  assisted programs \nand activities may violate the prohibition under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000d, and Title VI regulations against national origin discrimination.  USDA has issued guidance to clarify the responsibilities of recipients and subrecipients who receive financial assistance from USDA and assist them in fulfilling their responsibilities to LEP persons under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, as amended, and implementing regulations.    \nD.

Adverse decisions must be based upon regulations that are published in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR).

Informing Program Participants of Their Rights  \nWhenever an Agency official makes a decision that will adversely affect a program \nparticipant, the official must inform the participant in writing that an informal review with the person who made the decision may be requested. If the decision is appealable , \nthe participant will also be informed of their rights to seek mediation or Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) and to request a hearing with NAD; Attachment 1 -B is used \nfor this purpose.  If the decision cannot be appealed, participants will be informed  of their \nrights to have NAD review the accuracy of the Agency\u2019s finding that the decision cannot be appealed; Attachment 1 -C is used for this purpose. Mediation or ADR rights are not \nprovided on decisions that cannot be appealed. Attachment 1 -C is used for this purpose.  \nLetters notifying participants of adverse decisions must contain the required \ninformation regarding an informal meeting, mediation or ADR, rights to NAD, and civil rights.  Attachment 1 -A includes only the specific civil rights language that must be \ncontained in any adverse decision letter. Attachments 1 -B through 1- I contain, as \nnecessary, the civil rights language and include information on requesting an informal review, mediation or ADR, and rights to NAD.  The attachments are all titled to assist Agency staff in selecting the correct attachment for the decision being made. The attachments do not need to be used when a form, handbook letter, or other document already includes the appropriate participant rights.  \nB.  Adverse Decisions That Cannot Be Appealed  \nCertain decisions made by the Agency cannot be appealed. In these cases, the \nparticipant is still provided the opportunity for an informal review; however, rights to an \nNAD appeal and rights to mediation or ADR are not offered. Participants will be \n1-9 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623 ",

Decisions that cannot be appealed include:  \n\u2022 Decisions made by parties outside the Agency, even when these decisions are used as a basis for Agency decisions (such as when an applicant disagrees with a private lender\u2019s decision not to provide credit for a leveraged loan);  \n\u2022 An official\u2019s refusal to request an administrative waiver under the provisions of \nParagraph 1.12 of this handbook, or a waiver authorized by any applicable regulation;  \n\u2022 Denials of credit due to lack of funds; and  \n\u2022 Rural area designations.  \nWhen one or more of the reasons for an adverse decision are reasons that cannot be \nappealed, the adverse decision cannot be appealed. In these cases, the letter containing \nthe adverse decision will include only the items that cannot be appealed as the reason why the decision cannot be appealed. If other reasons also exist for the adverse decision, they will be listed separately in the decision letter as other reasons the assistance could not be granted.  \nC.  Informal Review  \nParticipants who want to request an informal review with the person who made the \ndecision must do so within 15 days  of the date of the Agency\u2019s letter notifying the \nparticipant of the adverse decision. The participant must make a request for an informal \nreview in writing, and the request will be retained in the participant\u2019s case file. The informal review can be conduc ted, at the discretion of the Agency, by telephone or \nthrough a face -to-face meeting. The informal review can also be conducted by a \nrepresen tative of the person who made the decision. The purpose of the informal review \nis to further explain the Agency\u2019s reasons for the adverse decision, listen to why the participant feels the decision may be incorrect, and obtain any further information from the participant to support their request. The review must be completed within 45 days  of \nthe request, and the participant is notified in writing of the results. The Leadership Designee may require that the decision be reviewed by the next -level supervisor o r other \ndesignated Rural Development Staff before the participant is notified of the decision. Attachment 1 -D will be used if the adverse decision is not reversed as a result of the \ninformal review. If the decision is reversed, a letter will be sent to the participant notifying them of the decision and next steps.  \nParticipants may skip an informal review and, if applicable, request mediation or \nADR, or an NAD appeal. In doing so, participants automatically waive their rights to an informal review.  \n \n1-10 \n  \n ",
  "page_34": "HB-3-3560 \n   \nD.  Mediation or ADR  \nAdverse decisions that are appealable to NAD also require that the participant be \ngiven the opportunity to seek mediation or ADR prior to having a hearing with NAD. The \npurpose of mediation or ADR is to resolve disputes through the use of a neutral mediato r.  \nParticipants may skip mediation or ADR and request a NAD appeal. In doing so, they \nautomatically waive their rights to mediation or ADR.  \n1.  Requests for Mediation or ADR  \nAfter receiving Attachment 1 -B or 1-D, a program participant may request mediation \nor ADR services. Upon receipt of the program participant\u2019s request for mediation or ADR, Attachment 1 -E, 1-G, or 1 -H is sent to the participant to start the process.  The \nAttachments used depends upon whether the State in which the action applies is covered by a USDA- sponsored mediation program. These Attachments are generally sent by the \nLeadership Designee since costs are involved; however, they can be sent directly by Agency staff  at the discretion of the Leadership Designee.  \n2.  Cost of Mediation or ADR  \nThere are generally costs associated with participation in mediation or ADR. When \nthere are costs, they will be shared equally between the Agency and the program participant, if Agency funds are available. Where Agency funds are not available, the \nAgency w ill participate in mediation or ADR if requested by the program participant; \nhowever, the program participant will be notified in advance of the portion of the cost that the Agency will pay (if any) and their estimated cost for this service. The Leadership  \nDesignee will ensure that all participants requesting mediation or ADR in their State are treated consistently and pay the same percentage of the cost toward this service. The Leadership Designee may also consent to pay a larger percentage (up to 100 percent) of \nthe cost of mediation or ADR for participants with incomes below the poverty level.  The \nAgency will notify the mediation or ADR sources of how the cost of such service will be paid. Attachments 1 -E, 1-F, 1-G, and 1- H include language to meet this requirement.  \n3.  Mediation in States with a USDA -Sponsored Mediation Program  \nMany States have a USDA -sponsored mediation program.  These programs are \nfunded, in part, by USDA and were established primarily to mediate cases originating from the Farm Service Agency (FSA). If program participants are unsure if a USDA -\nsponsored mediati on program exists in their State, they should contact their Leadership \nDesignee. In States with a USDA -sponsored mediation program, program participants \nwho are provided appeal rights generally will be referred to the USDA -sponsored \nmediation program. ADR is not applicable in these States. Attachment 1 -E may be sent \n1-11 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623 ",
  "page_35": "HB-3-3560 \nto the program participant to acknowledge their request, and Attachment 1 -F may be \nused to refer the case to the USDA -sponsored mediation program.  In States where \nalternative mediation sources are readily available at a lower cost than the USDA -\nsponsored mediation program, the State will follow the guidance for States without a \nUSDA- sponsored mediation program, and include the USDA -sponsored mediation \nprogram on the list of acceptable providers.  \n4.  Mediation or ADR in States without a USDA -Sponsored Mediation Program  \nIn States without a USDA -sponsored mediation program, Agency officials are \nresponsible for maintaining a list of mediators or ADR providers. The Agency will generally maintain this list as program participants are referred to the Leadership Designee to initiate mediation or ADR.  FSA can generally provide a list of acceptable mediation or ADR sources in a State. Other contacts include the American Association of Arbitrators (AAA) or State bar association. When making contacts with these sources, the Agency must request the services of a mediator and not an arbitrator.  (A mediator resolves disputes by negotiating a resolution through mutual agreement; an arbitrator resolves disputes through hearing both parties and then rendering a binding decision and shoul d not be used.)  The list of mediators will contain the approximate \ncost of each service provider, if known. States may handle the list of mediation and ADR sources as follows:  \n\u2022 The Agen cy may select a mediator or ADR provider from the list, provided there is \nnot a significant variation in the cost of service providers.  The list will be maintained \nalphabetically and sources selected in sequential order. Attachment 1 -G may be sent \nto the program participant to acknowledge their request for mediation or ADR, and \nAttachment 1 -F may be used to refer the case to the provider.  The Agency will need \nto maintain documentation to ensure that mediators and ADR providers receive and equal number of referrals. If there is a significant variation in cost among service providers, this option will not be used.  \n\u2022 The Agency may provide the list of mediators or ADR providers to the participant and request the participant to select the source or provide the name of another acceptable source of mediation or ADR. The list will contain the approximate cost of each service provider , if known. Attachment 1 -H is used for this purpose and \nprovides the participant with 10 days  to select a service provider. After selection, \nAttachment 1 -F will be used to refer the case to the mediator or ADR provider. If the \nprogram participan t does not provide the name of a mediator or ADR provider within \n10 days , their request for mediation or ADR will be considered withdrawn. \nWithdrawal or cancellation of mediation or ADR does not extinguish the participant\u2019s right to an appeal with NAD.  \n 5.   Timing of Mediation or ADR  \nMediation or ADR must be completed within 45 days  after the case is referred to the \nmediation or ADR source, unless the complexity of the case warrants a longer timeframe and all parties agree to a specific timeframe. A mediator or ADR provider will generally \n1-12 \n  ",

The Agency encourages the use of a pre- mediation conference \nsince many adverse decisions in the Multi -Family Housing program may not lend \nthems elves to mediation.  Regardless, the Agency will not refuse to participate in \nmediation or ADR if requested to do so by the program participant.  \nMediation or ADR occurs prior to having a hearing with NAD. Requests for \nmediation or ADR made prior to filing an appeal with NAD stop the clock on the 30- day \nperiod during which a participant may appeal to NAD. After mediation or ADR has concluded, any da ys that remain from the 30 -day period are available to the participant to \nrequest an appeal to NAD.  Attachment 1 -I is used for this purpose.  The person \ncompleting Attachment 1 -I will need to determine the number of days the participant \ntook to request me diation or ADR. Hearing dates for participants who request mediation \nor ADR after filing an appeal must be selected with 45 days  of the conclusion of \nmediation or ADR. Participants may also request mediation or ADR after filing an appeal with NAD but prior to the hearing.  \nE.  Appeal  \nParticipants who wish to appeal an adverse decision must submit a written request to \nNAD within 30 days  of receiving notice of an adverse decision. The request must be \nsigned by the participant and include: (1) a copy of the adverse decision to be appealed, and (2) a brief statement describing why the participant believes the decision is wrong.  \nUpon receiving a notice from NAD that an appeal has been filed, the Agency will \npromptly provide NAD with a copy of the Agency record, specific references in 7 CFR Part 3560 to support the adverse decision, and any other pertinent information.  A copy will also be provided to the program participant.  \nIn accordance with NAD regulations, the program participant has the right to a face -\nto-face hearing in the participant\u2019s State of residence. The program participant also has \nthe right to request that the hearing be handled by teleconference. An adverse dec ision \nmade by the Agency may result in an appeal hearing and may require a face- to-face \nhearing.  In these cases, the Leadership Designee will determine who will attend the hearing and represent the Agency.  The Leadership Designee  will provide sufficient \ndocumentation and phone resources to the person (s) selected by the Leadership Designee \nto adequately represent the Agency in the case.  \nNAD will notify the participant and the Agency once it has made a final \ndetermination.  If NAD reverses the Agency\u2019s decision, the next loan processing action that would have occurred had no adverse decision been made must be taken within 30 days after the effective date of the notice from NAD; unless the Agency requests a review of the case by the Director of NAD.

You will be advised directly by the mediation or ADR source if they can mediate your case. Once you request mediation or ADR, it stops the running of the 30- day period in \nwhich you may request an appeal (described in Option 2).

Under these programs, the Agency provides direct \nloans and grants to support the development of affordable rental housing that ser ves rural areas.  \nThe Section 538 Multi -Family Housing Guarantee program \u2014the Agency\u2019s third Multi -Family \nHousing program that guarantees loans made by private lenders \u2014is covered in a separate \nregulation [7 CFR Part 3565]  and HB -1-3565.  \nThis chapter also describes the key project servicing procedures that the Agency uses to \nadminister the terms of the Agency loan or grant agreement for the program.  These procedures provide MFH Servicing official s with a consistent basis for conducting servicing actions and \nassisting borrowers in meeting their responsibilities.  \nSection 1 of this chapter introduces the types of loans and other forms of assistance \navailable through the Section 515 program and the Agency\u2019s objectives in providing this assistance.  Section 2 of this chapter describes the loans, grants, and other assi stance available to \nincrease the supply of affordable housing specifically targeted toward farm labor.  The chapter concludes with Section 3, which introduces the major project servicing activities, as well as the key parties involved.  \nSECTION 1:  SECTION 515 PROGRAM  \n2.2   OVERVIEW  \nThe Section 515 program offers direct loans to eligible borrowers to provide \neconomically designed and constructed housing and related facilities for very low -, low -, and \nmoderate- income households; elderly households; and persons with disabilities living in rural \nareas.  This section of the chapter describes:  \n\u2022 The types of projects allowed;  \n\u2022 The types of loans available; and \n\u2022 Rental assistance available from the Agency.  \n2.3   TYPES OF PROJECTS  \nThere are four basic types of rental projects that can be developed using Section 515 \nloans:  \n\u2022 Family projects;  \n\u2022 Elderly projects;  \n2-1 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623 ",
  "page_63": "HB-3-3560  \n \u2022 Congregate projects; and  \n\u2022 Group homes.  \nIn addition, Section 515 loans can be used to finance rural cooperative housing projects.  \nThe Agency also services existing mixed projects that contain both family and elderly units.  \nThe housing must be economical and must not include elaborate features, but it must be \nadequate to meet tenants\u2019 needs.  The project should be of average quality and cost.  With the \nexception of off -farm labor housing, all projects must be developed in loc ations that qualify as \nrural areas.  \nA.  Family Projects  \nA family housing project is a rental property developed for occupancy by eligible \nvery low -, low -, or moderate -income households.   \nB.  Elderly Projects  \nAn elderly project is a rental property that is developed for occupancy solely by \neligible elderly households that include a tenant or cotenant that is disabled or age 62 years or older.   \nC.  Congregate Projects  \nCongregate projects are rental properties developed for occupancy by eligible very \nlow-, low -, and moderate income elderly households that need meals or other services to \nassist them in performing activities of daily living.  Congregate projects consist of  private \napartments and central dining facilities in which a number of allowable preestablished services are provided to tenants.  These projects are not  designed to be nursing homes \nand, therefore, are not allowed to pay for the cost of medical - or health care-related \nservices.   \nD.  Group Homes  \n A group home is housing that is occupied by eligible very low -, low -, or moderate -\nincome elderly persons or individuals with disabilities who share living space within a rental unit and in which a resident assistant may be required.  \nE.  Rural Cooperative Housing  \nSection 515 loans may be used to finance rural cooperative housing projects operated \nby nonprofit consumer cooperatives for the benefit of eligible very low -, low - and \nmoderate- income members.  \n  \n2-2 \n  ",
  "page_64": "HB-3-3560  \n F.  Mixed Projects  \nMixed projects are properties developed with a portion of the units designated as \nfamily units and the remainder of the units established as elderly units.  At the time the \nproject is developed, the borrower must designate the units that will be operated as family units and those that will be operated as elderly units.   NOTE:  Rural Development no \nlonger finances mixed projects. \n2.4   TYPES OF LOANS  \nThe rules governing the origination of Section 515 loans differ slightly, depending upon \nthe type of loan being made.  The types of loans available under Section 515 include:  \n\u2022 Initial loans;  \n\u2022 Subsequent loans; and \n\u2022 Assumed loans. \nThis section describes the three types of loans and how they differ.  The first two types \nare discussed in further detail in HB -1-3560.  The requirements and procedures for assumed \nloans and equity loans are covered in Chapter 7.  \nA.  Initial Loans  \nInitial loans are made to projects with no existing Agency loan.  Most initial loans are \nmade to build new properties.  However, the Agency makes initial loans for the \nrehabilitation of existing properties when it is in the Agency\u2019s best interest.  \nThe interest rate for these loans is set at the note rate established by the Agency in \nRD Instruction 440.1.  The Agency then provides interest credit assistance, which \nreduces the effective interest rate to 1 percent\n1.  Interest credit is only provided for units \noccupied by eligible tenants paying at least 30 percent of their income for rent.  The administration of interest credit is covered in this handbook and HB -2-3560. \nThe Agency establishes the term of these loans to correspond to the expected useful \nlife of the property.  The maximum term is 30 years with an amortization period not to exceed 50 years.  Generally, initial loans are made for a term of 50 years, with the exception of properties where the expected useful life is a shorter period (e.g., manufactured housing).  \n \n1 Some existing projects do not receive interest credit, while others receive interest credit that reduces the interest \nrate to three percent.  However, all initial loans made by the Agency following the publication of this handbook will \nreceive interest cr edit as described here.  \n__________________________________________________________________________________________  \n2-3 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623 ",
  "page_65": "HB-3-3560  \n B.  Subsequent Loans  \nSubsequent loans can be issued during the term of an Agency loan to help an existing \nborrower pay for repairs or improvements to the property or in conjunction with the \ntransfer of a property where the purchaser is assuming the initial Agency loan.  The ke y \ndifferences between processing requirements for subsequent and initial Section 515 loans \nare discussed in Chapter 10 of HB -1-3560.  Guidance regarding the requirements and \nprocedures for processing project transfers is covered in Chapter 7.  Subsequent l oans \nmay also be used to finance equity to avert prepayment of the project.  \nC.  Assumed Loans  \nSection 515 loans may be assumed in conjunction with the transfer of ownership of \nthe property.  The terms and conditions of the assumption depend upon the needs of the \nproject at the time of the transfer.  The procedures for processing transfers and \nassum ptions are presented in Chapter 5. \n1.  New Rates and Terms Assumption  \nMost assumptions of Section 515 loans are new rates and terms assumptions \u2014that is, \nthe purchaser assumes responsibility for all or a portion of the remaining debt.  To conserve the Agency\u2019s budgetary resources, the transaction does not involve paying off the old loan and issuing a new initial loan.  Instead, the purchaser assumes the \noutstanding debt, which is reamortized at new rates and terms.  New rates and terms assumptions are used when the purchaser will experience financial difficulties under the terms of the initial loan or when a change in rates and terms is necessary to facilitate the \ntransfer.  Purchasers may apply for subsequent loans to make up the difference between the amount of debt assumed and the purchase price or to address physical needs at the project.  \n2.  Same Rates and Terms Assumption  \nTransfers may also take place in conjunction with a same rates and terms assumption.  \nUnder this type of assumption, the existing note terms, including the interest rate and the remaining repayment period, do not change.  \n2.5   AGENCY RENTAL ASSISTANCE  \nOwners of projects located in areas where prospective tenants are likely to be rent \noverburdened or existing tenants are already overburdened can apply for rental assistance administered by the Agency.  This rental subsidy assists tenants by allowing them to pay 30 percent of adjusted income for rent, thereby reducing the financial burden on the household.  The Agency pays the difference between the tenant contribution and the approved shelter costs for the unit through the rental assistance contract with t he borrower.  \n \n2-4 \n  ",
  "page_66": "HB-3-3560  \n 2.6   PREFERENCE FOR PROJECTS THAT LEVERAGE OTHER FUNDS  \nTo maximize the number of units produced with Section 515 loan funds, the Agency \ngives preference to project applications for new loans that leverage other funds, thereby reducing \nthe amount of Section 515 loan funds needed to develop the project.  The greater the leveraging proposed in a project application, the greater the  preference for funding.  Examples of funds that \ncount as leveraged funds include borrower resources beyond the minimum required amount, \nequity generated by the sale of low -income housing tax credits (LIHTCs), a second loan from \nanother lender, or a grant from a State or Local public agency or other source.  \n2-5 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623 ",

Section 514/516 assistance differs from the Section 515 \nloans in the following ways:  \n\u2022 The objective of the program is to provide housing for farmworkers;  \n\u2022 There are no rural restrictions; and  \n\u2022 Agency grants are available to support the development of these projects. \nSection 514/516 assistance may be used for off -farm labor housing projects and Section 514 \nassistance may be used only for on- farm labor housing projects.  Only Section 514 assistance \nmay be used in conjunction with Federal LIHTCs.  \nA.  Off- Farm Labor Housing  \nThe Agency is authorized to make loans and grants for financing off -farm labor \nhousing to broad- based nonprofit organizations; nonprofit organizations of farmworkers; \nFederally recognized Indian tribes, agencies, or political subdivisions of State or Local  \nGovernment; and public agencies, such as local housing authorities. Section 514 loans can be made to limited partnerships in which the general partner is a nonprofit entity. \nB.  On -Farm Labor Housing  \nOn-farm labor housing is designed to provide adequate housing for farmworkers \ninvolved in a specific farming operation.  Individual farmers, family farm corporations or \npartnerships, or associations of farmers may develop these projects but must operate them \non a nonprofit basis.  To qualify for occupancy, an individual or a household must simply be employed as part of the farming operation.  There is no income restriction governing occupancy.  However, immediate family members of individuals with an owners hip \ninterest in the farm are prohibited from living in this housing.  \n2.8   LOANS AND GRANTS  \nThe Agency offers loans and grants to finance Farm Labor Housing projects. Chapter 12 \nof HB -1-3560 provides more information about the origination process for these loans and \ngrants. \nA.  Farm Labor Housing Loans  \nSection 514 loans for farm labor housing projects are very similar to Section 515 \nloans, but they differ in two important ways:  \n\u2022 These loans carry a 1 percent effective interest rate (i.e., there is no interest credit).  \n2-7 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623 ",

Today, lending decisions regarding loans for off -farm labor housing \nprojects are handled through a competitive Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) \nprocess, while loans for on- farm labor housing projects are still processed in the order \nthat they are received.  \nB.  Farm Labor Housing Grants  \nSection 516 grants may only be used to support the development of off -farm labor \nhousing projects.  These grants may be used for the same purposes as Section 514 loans when there is reasonable doubt that the housing would not be provided without the grant. \n2.9   RENTAL ASSISTANCE  \nApplicants for Section 514/516 assistance for off -farm labor housing projects may also \napply for rental assistance administered by the Agency.  The requirements for obtaining rental assistance are the same as for Section 515 projects.  On -farm labor housing projects are not \neligible for this rental assistance.  \n2.10   PREFERENCE FOR PROJECTS THAT LEVERAGE OTHER FUNDS  \nLike the Section 515 program, the Agency gives preference to applications for off -farm \nlabor housing projects that leverage other sources of funds.  There is no leveraging preference for \non-farm labor housing applications. \n2-8 \n ",

  "page_73": "HB-3-3560  \n CHAPTER 3:  AUTOMATED SYSTEMS  \n3.1   INTRODUCTION \nMany of the Agency\u2019s account servicing activities are dependent on data submitted to the \nAgency by tenants and borrowers.  These data are tracked by the Agency  using automated \nsystems.  This section describes the Agency\u2019s four primary automated information management \nsystems\u2014the Management Agent Interactive Network Connection (MINC), the Automated Multi- Family Housing Accounting System (AMAS), the Multi -Family I nformation System \n(MFIS), and the Prepayment Tracking and Concurrence (Pre -Trac) \u2014including their purpose and \ncapabilities, staff responsibilities, and training and certification requirements.  \nIt is important to understand that while this section identifies the specific activities that \nmay be accomplished using the various automated systems, many of the activities listed for a particular system cannot be accomplished without inputs from one or m ore of the others.  For \ninstance, monthly loan payment amounts are tracked using AMAS, but those amounts cannot be determined without inputs from MFIS.  Similarly, while MFIS is used to identify and track the status of borrower noncompliance, the standards  by which compliance is measured come from \nAMAS.  \nEvery MFH Servicing official  is required to be familiar with each of the Agency\u2019s \nautomated systems.  This includes gaining familiarity with not only the basic information in this chapter, but the more detailed user manuals for each system and periodic training offered to staff.  \n3.2   MANAGEMENT INTERACTIVE NETWORK CONNECTION \nMINC is  a database used by t he Agency to reduce the cost of compliance and increase the \neffectiveness of supervisory actions in the Multi -Family Housing program. \nA.  Background  \nBefore a borrower can submit a payment to the Agency for review and processing, \nthe Agency needs to determine and inform the borrower of the correct payment amount.  \nBefore the payment amount can be determined, the borrower needs to collect and submit to the Agency the tenant data that is used in the calculation of rental assistance, interest \ncredit, and ultimately, the \u201cnet\u201d payment amount that must be submitted by the borrower.  To make the required calculations, tenant data are entered into MFIS, and the  outputs \nfrom MFIS are ultimately entered into AMAS for tracking.  It is crucial that tenant data be correct, because over $1 billion in tenant subsidy is awarded annually based on each \ntenant\u2019s status.  \nPreviously borrowers have submitted tenant data to the Agency by mailing paper \ncopies to the Servicing Office each month to reflect current occupancy status.  Borrowers now must submit data through an automated interface  with the Agency \u2013 MINC . \n3-1 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623 ",
  "page_74": "HB-3-3560  \nB.  Purpose and Capabilities  \nMINC enables management agents to transmit tenant data electronically, via the \nInternet.  In addition to tenant data, management agents can transmit Form RD 3560- 7, \nMultiple Family Housing Project Budget/Utility Allowance , and Form RD 3560- 10, \nBorrower Balance Sheet .  Data that are transmitted correctly, and contain changes that \nare within the allowable parameters, are automatically uploaded into MFIS. Data that are \ntransmitted incorrectly, or that does not comply with Agency regulations, are \u201crejected\u201d \nby MINC.  Questionable data transactions, containing changes requiring review by the Agency , are held in a \u201cpending\u201d status in the MFIS electronic transmission web page.  A \nmessage is  sent to the management agent, detailing the result of each transaction \ntransmitted such as accepted, rejected, pending, etc.  The Agency  reviews transmitted \ntransactions, through the use of a \u201cDaily Report,\u201d to determine if there is any action necessary on the Agency\u2019s part . MINC provides the capability of  Borrowers to view, \napprove and submit their Form RD 3560- 29 to the Agency.  If the borrower discovers any \ndiscrepancies in the report, a correcting transaction is transmitted or the Servicing Office is contacted for guidance.  Once the report is determined to be correct, the borrower approves and submits the payme nt. \nC.  Staff Responsibilities  \nIn accordance with 7 CFR Part 3560, all borrowers are required to electronically \ntransmit their tenant and financial data and process their payments, for projects with eight units or more.  Agency  Staff should contact all borrowers/management agents, and \nprovide them with instructions for accessing a nd using MINC.  The steps involved in this \nprocess are as follows:  \n\u2022 Contact the borrower/management agent, and verify that the taxpayer identification number on file with the Agency is correct for the management agent;  \n\u2022 Validate that all projects for said management agent are associated to the taxpayer identification number;  \n\u2022 Inform the borrower/management agent to access the MINC Web site at https://usdaminc.sc.egov.usda.gov, and print a copy of the training handbook; and \n\u2022 Instruct the borrower/management agent to follow the step -by-step instructions \ncontained in the training handbook to obtain a MINC access code and password.  The help manual should be consulted for any problems they encounter while completing this process.  In the event that questions still exist after having consulted the help \nmanual, the borrower/management agent should then contact the Servicing Office for assistance.  \nThe borrower/management agent will be required to electronically accept an \nautomated version of the Trading Partner Agreement (TPA) while obtaining their MINC access code and password.  The date of acceptance is stored within the system should this informa tion be needed at a later date.  \n3-2 \n ",
  "page_75": "HB-3-3560  \n  The Servicing Office goals are to:  \n\u2022 Maintain project information on MFIS, completing primary processing of \nsubmissions of changes to tenant data between the first and tenth days of each month;  \n\u2022 Provide MFIS reports in a timely manner, or as requested by the borrower/management agent; and  \n\u2022 Confirm the receipt of data transmission when asked. \nThe Servicing Office should refer borrowers/management agents to vendors to \ntroubleshoot software as needed.  Some borrowers/management agents with small \nprojects do not use vendor software; instead, they transmit through MINC using the \u201cFill -\na-Form\u201d optio n and may need more assistance from the Servicing Office.  Any \nautomation or program -related issues that are discovered by the Servicing Office should \nbe reported to the Leadership Designee.  \nD.  Benefits of MINC  \nMINC benefits all parties involved.  Electronic submission of data saves borrowers \nthe burden and cost of generating and mailing paper documentation to the Agency.  The \nAgency saves the burden and cost of handling mail, sorting and copying paper documentat ion, and reentering tenant data by hand.  Freeing staff from clerical tasks \nallows them to focus on analytical responsibilities, such as reviewing occupancy patterns to uncover civil rights violations, tenant fraud, unacceptable management practices, and warning signs of occupancy problems.  \nIn addition, MINC allows borrowers more time to meet deadlines.  Changes \nsubmitted through MINC are required to be filed by the tenth of the month, an extension \nof 10 days.  For borrowers, this provides more time to ensure that their information is assembled properly, and is complete and accurate.  More accurate information results in fewer mistakes to correct with the borrower.  Even if there are m istakes, MINC allows \nfor next -day response by the Agency.  As a result, corrections can be made while the \nborrower\u2019s memory is still fresh.  \nMINC also reduces the chance that borrowers will be charged overage for late \ncertifications, which can result in a substantial penalty for borrowers, management agents, and site managers.  Extended submission deadlines and faster turnaround on submission r eviews reduce the possibility of overage being charged for late data.  \nMINC reduces the chance that borrowers will be charged a late fee due to the receipt \nof their mortgage payment being delayed by delivery issues such as mail routing errors and incorrect postage.  Borrowers have the ability to review the accuracy of their Form RD 3560- 29 online, making any corrections and approving it for processing.  Borrowers \nwho are required to submit a payment with their Form RD 3560- 29 can sign up for Pre -\nAuthorized Debit (PAD), which electronically transfers the funds owed from the borrower\u2019s bank account to Rural Development.  Borrowers who receive an RA check \n3-3 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623 ",

Staff Training and Certification Requirements  \nBeyond gaining familiarity with the functions of the system, there are few formal \ntraining or certification requirements for MFH S ervicing officials  using MINC. \n3.3   AUTOMATED MULTI -FAMILY HOUSING ACCOUNTING SYSTEM  \nA.  Purpose and Capabilities  \nAMAS maintains loan account information, tracks loan status, and disburses project \nsubsidy.  AMAS has been operational since 1985 and is located on the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Kansas City mainframe.  The Systems Development Division in St. Lo uis administers AMAS.  \nAMAS is the Agency\u2019s primary financial accounting system.  Any data relating to a \nborrower\u2019s account (e.g., payment amount, payment due date, account status) are tracked using AMAS.  In addition, payment entry, verification, and reconciliation are accompli shed using AMAS. \nB.  Staff Responsibilities  \nAgency staff  using AMAS are responsible for the following activities:  \n\u2022 Closing loans, including reamortized loans;  \n\u2022 Disbursing loan funds;  \n\u2022 Determining note, rental assistance, and interest credit payment amounts;  \n\u2022 Determining payment due dates;  \n\u2022 Verify loan payment processing;  \n\u2022 Converting accounts from Daily Interest Accrual System (DIAS) to Predetermined Amortization Schedule System (PASS);  \n\u2022 Determining current loan balances for transfer;  \n\u2022 Obligating loan funds;  \n\u2022 Adjusting accounts in response to unauthorized assistance;  \n\u2022 Processing recaptured unauthorized assistance;  \n\u2022 Adjusting accounts for interest rate changes;  \n3-4 \n  ",

Staff Training and Certification Requirements  \nMFH Servicing officials  must be certified by the Leadership Designee  to process \npayments in AMAS.  The AMAS Coordinator is responsible for the payment processing \ncertification process and will make recommendations to the Leadership Designee , based \non certification examination.  Uncertified staff may access the view -only screens within \nthe system, but cannot alter any of the data.  \n1.  Basic Skills Required  \nThe basic areas a Loan Servicer must master to receive certification include the \nfollowing:  \n\u2022 The employee must successfully review and process payments for three call dates;  \n\u2022 The employee must understand the process for verifying that payment processed in MFIS is updated correctly in AMAS; and \n\u2022 For offices on the wholesale lockbox system, the employee must properly prepare the Field Office Remittance Reconciliation Report and all related forms for submission to the wholesale lockbox.  \n2.  Procedures for Certification Training  \nThe procedures for certification training are as follows:  \n\u2022 The employee will be trained by the AMAS Coordinator, or by a qualified Agency  \nemployee.  The training must cover the following areas:  \n\u25ca Release Form RD 3560- 29 for borrower\u2019s review;  \n\u25ca Reviewing and processing the borrower\u2019s payment transmittal;  \n\u25ca Establish and maintain PAD accounts;  \n\u25ca Understanding the payment logic;  \n\u25ca Signing onto the AMAS Cash System (AMAS -CSH);  \n3-5 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623   ",

The envelope will be marked \u201cPayment Certification for (trainee name)\u201d and submitted to the AMAS Coordinator. \n3.  Recommendation of Certification  \nThe AMAS Coordinator will review the balanced blocks and the accounting data \nenvelope prepared for the examination.  When the employee has demonstrated an understanding of the payment process and proficiency in all steps listed above, the AMAS Coordinator will recommend certification to the Leadership Designee.  The Leadership Designee  will: \n\u2022 Instruct the IRM to notify the Security Officer in the Finance Office to add AMAS payment process to the employee\u2019s user identification number; and \n\u2022 Notify the Loan Servicer and employee, by letter, of the employee\u2019s certification to process payments.  The letter must list the possible reasons for withdrawal of certification.  \n4.  Monitoring Payment Processing  \nAfter certification, the AMAS Coordinator will periodically monitor Field Office \npayment proc essing activities to ensure that payments are being input properly and \nverified.  For newly certified employees, monitoring should be daily for a 30 -day period.  \nFor experienced employees, monitoring should be no less than monthly, provided monitoring reports do not indicate any of the problems that could lead to withdrawal of certification.  \nA log of each monitoring activity should be kept by the AMAS Coordinator for \ndocumentation using Form RD 3560- 64, Online Payment Certification Monitoring Log.  \n5.  Withdrawal of Certification and Recertification  \nCertification may be withdrawn from an employee if the effective date of the \npayment and the call date differ by more than 3 days and there is not sufficient justification (e.g., office was closed on the regularly scheduled work day that the payment was re ceived; weekend and holidays caused a 3 -day delay before the payment could be \nprocessed).  \nAfter the third occurrence of any of the above errors in a 12- month period, the \nLeadership Designee  will notify the Loan Servicer and employee in writing that \n3-6 \n ",

The notice will include plans and requirements for \nremedial training.  \nThe Leadership Designee  will withdraw certification after the fourth occurrence in a \n12-month period of any of the above errors.  The Leadership Designee will notify the \nLoan Servicer and employee in writing, with a copy to the IRM for the State.  The IRM will notify the Security Office in the Finance Office to remove online payment authority from the employee\u2019s identification number.  \n6.  Retraining  \nAn employee should be retrained immediately when a payment processing problem \noccurs as a result of an employee error.  This training should cover the areas causing problems and should prevent recurrence of the error.  After certification has been withdraw n, the Leadership Designee  must determine whether it is desirable for the \nemployee to process payments.  If so, the retraining should be performed immediately.  The employee may be recertified if retraining has been completed, the employee demonstrates the  necessary skills to process payments, the AMAS Coordinator \nrecommends recertification, and the Leadership Designee concurs.  \n3.4   MULTI -FAMILY INFORMATION SYSTEM  \nA.  Purpose and Capabilities  \nMFIS assists MFH Servicing officials  in monitoring the Multi -Family Housing \nprogram, maintains data on clients, and provides comprehensive and flexible reporting.  MFIS was designed to improve management and supervision routines of MFH Servicing officials .  It is the monitoring and scheduling system used  by the Agency  and provides \nthe analytical tools to review budgets and financial information.  MFIS has a classification system that uses information entered during normal supervisory activities to identify projects needing additional servicing attention.   \nMFIS is used by the Agency to track tenant data, and it is employed mainly to ensure \nthat each tenant receives the correct amount of subsidy.  MFIS uses the tenant data to calculate tenant rents and rental assistance, which drive many subsequent account servicing activities.  MFIS is also the source for occupancy statistics used to describe \nMulti- Family Housing program beneficiaries.  \nMFIS is the primary tool used by the Agency to track the status of borrowers\u2019 \ncompliance with loan agreements and all other program requirements.  Account status data from AMAS are transferred to MFIS, where  MFH Servicing officials  use them to \nmonitor the status of borrower compliance.  For instance, the system holds data on project classification based on compliance status (i.e., Classification codes A, B, C, or D).  In addition, the system tracks the status of project budgets (i.e ., when they are due, whe n \nthey are received, and when they are approved).  \nThe goal of using MFIS for tracking is to identify borrower compliance violations, as \nwell as to track the status of servicing letters, workout agreements, and other Agency \n3-7 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623   ",
  "page_80": "HB-3-3560  \nservicing actions.  For instance, MFIS tracks the 15 -day period for responses to servicing \nletters or monitoring letters and alerts staff to the need for follow -up when that period has \nexpired.  \nMFIS also is used to track each  team\u2019s  performance in meeting Agency goals, and \nevaluates  those teams that may need additional assistance in determining solutions to \nproblem accounts and the effectiveness of actions previously taken.  The Agency uses  the \ninformation from MFIS in monthly staff meetings and to provide information to \nborrowers.  MFIS allows for timely assembly of this information with minimal effort from the MFH Servicing official . \nAll regular borrower payments are processed through MFIS.  MFIS maintains a \ncollection history for each borrower.  \nB.  Major Components of MFIS  \nThe MFIS home page displays icons that each represents  a Web page of their own \nthat link to each other and are capable of interacting by accessing the data contained \ntherein.  The five main icons a MFH Servicing official  should be concerned with are \nProjects, Project Payments, C ustomers, Reports, Electronic Transmissions, and Message \nBoard.  Each web page contains links for data input and analysis of important multi -\nfamily housing portfolio issues such as borrower compliance with their loan agreement/resolu tion, management efficiency, financial stability, occupancy trends, rent \nstructures, and identities -of-interest, as well as program strengths and deficiencies.  \nMoreover, MFIS archives a history of the multi -family housing portfolio nationwide, \nproviding i nformation necessary for determining the need for program changes and/or \nenhancements as well as funding needs.  \n\u2022 Projects.  This page is used when working on information specific to a single project.  It contains the data on the borrower, management agent, project tenants, type of project, and the like.  Basically it contains all information that was formerly contained on the M anagement Card System for each project.  Any incorrect information on this \npage could lead to improper calculations on Form RD 3560- 29, Notice of Payment \nDue Report , that the borrower uses to make their monthly/annual installment from, \nthus caus ing unnecessary delinquencies.  \nThe Projects page is also where the Agency  maintains information concerning \nborrower/management agent compliance with Agency regulations.  One link on this page is Supervisory Activities.  Supervisory Activities, when properly populated, can serve as an excellent tickler system to let the MFH Servicing official know when action is needed on their part.  The same is true for the link Servicing Efforts, Findings, Financial Instruments, and Rents.  When all components are analyzed, a clear and concise picture of the needs of the project can easily be determined. \n\u2022 Project Payments.  This page is used to perform activities related to payment processing.  These functions include scheduling the release of Form Rd 3560- 29 to \nborrowers, processing payments, and review payments.  In addition, users can view \n3-8 \n ",
  "page_81": "HB-3-3560  \n and make adjustments for a specific pay period, monitor uncollectible returns, review \nand edit RA Obligations tracking for projects receiving RA units due to an obligation or transfer of units.  The Project Payments page can be a very valuable tool when evaluating the feasibility of various servicing actions, providing collection history for \na specific project at any given time.  \n\u2022 Customers.   This page should be used when working on information across projects \nor specific only to the borrower, key member, or management agent.  This is the page used to enter the key members of the borrower and management agent.  It also allows the user to access all of the projects managed by a particular management agent, enabling an identical change to multiple projects with ease.  \n\u2022 Reports.  This page contains predesigned reports by category, such as borrower, financials, findings, management agent, project, project summary, tenant, and tracking.  Under each category, several different reports that may be generated are listed.  The user is al lowed to complete various data fields to allow one to zero in on \nthe particular information that is desired.  The accuracy of these reports is based on the information that has been input into the Projects and Customer Web pages. \n\u2022 Electronic Transmissions.  This page allows the MFIS user to view the individual transactions that have been electronically transmitted by the borrower/management agent.  It is an important tool in assisting the borrower/management agent in correctly transmitting the data necessary to reflect the correct tenant and/or financial data.  \n\u2022 Message Board.  Below the icons for the individual Web pages is a link to the message board.  Each user of MFIS is encouraged to view the message board on a \nregular basis.  This shows information on changes that have been made to the system.  Step-by-step instructions for  the input of all requested and/or required data are \nprovided in the training manuals that are accessible from the message board. \nC.  Staff Responsibilities  \nMFH Servicing officials  are responsible for populating all data fields contained in the \nMFIS system with accurate and current information.  The upgrading of the MFIS system is an ongoing process.  It is extremely important that the information contained in MFIS III for each borrower/management agent/project be input and accurate.  \n3.5   PREPAYMENT TRACKING AND CONCURRENCE  \nPre-Trac is a Web -based automated application that allows the Agency to significantly \nreduce the reporting burden required to process and monitor Multi -Family Housing prepayment \nactivity.  This means that the Agency enters prepayment -tracking information once for use by all \nadministrative levels.  The Agency uses  Pre-Trac to process all prepayment requests to meet the \nAgency\u2019s requirements.

  "page_83": "HB-3-3560  \n CHAPTER 4:  ACCOUNT SERVICING  \n4.1   INTRODUCTION \nTo ensure that program objectives are met and that borrowers do not default on their \nloans, the Agency has specific procedures for servicing borrower accounts.  These procedures \nare designed to ensure that loan payments are received on time and in the proper amounts; payments are properly applied to the appropriate account; past due accounts are serviced correctly; late fees are assessed for late paymen ts; and procedures for final loan payments are \nfollowed. Diligent management of the account servicing process through promptly and accurately recording payments and tracking late payments is an effective method to reduce unnecessary delinquencies. \nThis chapter presents the Agency\u2019s procedures for servicing borrower accounts.  It \ndescribes the procedures that all MFH Servicing official s must follow when servicing accounts \nto protect the Government\u2019s interest in the loan and the property.  \n4.2   OVERVIEW  \nAgency regulations in 7 CFR 3560.401 through 7 CFR 3560.403 establish borrowers\u2019 \nresponsibilities and the actions the Agency may take to collect timely loan payments from \nborrowers, protect its interests and the security of its loan, and assist borrowers i n meeting the \nobjectives and requirements of the loan.  These regulations require that borrowers repay their \nloans to the Agency according to the specific provisions of their debt instruments and operate their facilities in accordance with requirements of the rule and other applicable Federal, State, \nand Local laws.  The Agency may reject any servicing request by a borrower if it is not in the best interest of the Government or tenants.  \nMost servicing requirements and procedures are the same for Daily Interest Accrual \nSystem (DIAS) accounts and Predetermined Amortization Schedule System (PASS) accounts, with the exception of the assessment of late fees, which only applies to PASS accounts .  \nPayments under DIAS are not assessed late fees because additional interest is charged automatically, based on the number of days the past due balance is outstanding. \nSECTION 1:  ACCOUNT SERVICING REQUIREMENTS  \n[7 CFR 3560.403 AND 7 CFR 3560.404]  \nThe Agency\u2019s regular account servicing requirements cover the following major topic \nareas: loan payments, late fees, waivers, servicing past due accounts, conversion of accounts from DIAS to PASS, and final loan payments.  This section describes the regula tory \nrequirements for each area.  \n4.3   LOAN PAYMENTS  \nBorrower loan payments are due on the first day of each month unless otherwise \nestablished in the debt instrument executed with the Agency.  A borrower is in default of loan \n4-1 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623 ",
  "page_84": "HB-3-3560  \nagreements when the Agency has not received the full payment by the first day of the month.  \nThe Agency is under no obligation to offer borrowers loan servicing other than actions consistent with debt instruments and other agreements.  However, the Agency does not pursue legal action to cure the default until a borrower is 60 days delinquent.  If a borrower with a PASS account has not paid the full amount by the tenth day of the month, a late fee may be incurred.  \n4.4   LATE FEES (PASS ACCOUNTS ONLY)  \nThe Agency will charge a fee for late payments under PASS accounts, equal to 6 percent \nof the note installment.  Late fees are charged if any portion of a note payment exceeding $15 is late (i.e., outstanding after the tenth day of the month).  The Agency may charge late fees only once for each regular installment or portion thereof. \nLate fees are an owner expense and, as such, may not be charged to the project. The \namount of the late fees is no t appealable.  The Finance Office notifies all late borrowers with \nPASS accounts of late fees and the payment due , not including overage and rental assistance \ncalculations.  The MFH Servicing official  should follow up with the borrower on this notification \nin an effort to collect the amount due before an account becomes 30 days past due. \n4.5   LATE FEE WAIVERS  \nThe Leadership Designee  may waive late fees only for circumstances beyond a \nborrower\u2019s control or when granting the waiver is in the best interest of the Government.  \nWaivers are issued at the Agency\u2019s discretion and the Agency is  under no obligation to grant \nwaivers.  \n4.6   PAST DUE ACCOUNTS  \nA.  Past Due Payments  \nThe Agency considers a borrower to be delinquent if any past due amount remains \nafter the payment due date.  If a delinquency exists, the Agency immediately contacts the borrower and attempts to collect the amount due.  \n4-2 \n  ",
  "page_85": "HB-3-3560  \nB.  Interest on Past Due Payments \n(PASS Accounts Only)  \nWhen a regular payment continues \nto be past due on the first day of the month following the payment due date, \nthe Agency charges interest at the note \nrate on the unpaid delinquent principal \namount.  Interest is charged from the date the principal was due u ntil all \napplicable payments are current in accordance with the number of full installments required by the Form RD 3560- 52, Promissory Note , and is in \naddition to the scheduled interest of the regular payment.  The interest on delinquent principal, the unpaid delinquent principal, any applicable late fees, and recoverable cost charges are added to the regular payment amount due for the next month to determine the total amount due as of the first of the month following the delinquency. \nC.  Special Servicing Action  \nBorrowers with accounts 30 days past due may be subject to the special servicing \nprovisions outlined in Chapters 10 and 12 of this handbook. \n4.7   CONVERSION FROM DIAS TO PASS  \nTo facilitate and standardize its servicing efforts, the Agency requires that all new loans \nbe closed and serviced using PASS.  The only exceptions are off -farm and on- farm labor housing \nloans, which may be closed on either DIAS or PASS. Farm labor loans m ay be closed on DIAS \nif the farm operation is such that the annual payment corresponds to the timing of usual farm \nincome.  \nBorrowers with DIAS accounts, except for farm labor housing loans, must convert to \nPASS if they request servicing actions that involve a change in the terms of their loan (e.g., credit sales, reamortizations, equity incentive loans, loan consolidations, and project transfers) or if they request subsequent loans. Example  \u2013 Determining Days for Past Due \nAccounts  \nIf a borrower fails to make a scheduled \npayment in full due on June 1, the following \nexample demonstrates how the Agency \ncalculates past due charges:  \nJune 1 \u2013  Payment due date.  \nJune 2 \u2013  Payment is 1 day past due.  No \nAgency action taken.  \nJune 11 \u2013 Payment is 11 days past due.  Late \ncharge applied on overdue payments.  \nJune 30 \u2013 Borrower is delinquent and 30 days \npast due.

  "page_86": "HB-3-3560  \n4.8   FINAL LOAN PAYMENTS  \nBefore the MFH Servicing official  begins the final loan payment process, they must \ndetermine if the final loan payment is a prepayment, as covered in Chapter 15. \nA borrower\u2019s final loan payment must include repayment of all outstanding obligations to \nthe Agency.  The Agency will apply any remaining supervised funds to the borrower\u2019s account  \nor return such funds to the borrower following acceptance of final payment. At the borrower\u2019s \nrequest, the Agency will provide a written statement indicating the amount necessary to pay the \naccount in full.  \nSuitable forms of payment include cashier\u2019s check, money order, or bank draft.  If a \nborrower uses forms of payment that require special handling, the borrower is responsible for the \ncost of such handling.  When payment is provided in a form that is not the equivalent of cash, the \nAgency will consider a payment to be received at the time the funds have been successfully \ntransferred to the Agency.  This can now be accomplished electronically through Pre -Authorized \nDebit (PAD).  \nThe Agency will release security instruments when full payment of all outstanding \nobligations to the Agency have been re ceived and accepted.  If the Agency and the borrower \nagree to settle the account for less than the full amount owed, the Agency may release security instruments when the borrower has paid all agreed -upon obligations in full.  Recording costs for \nthe releas e of the security instruments will be the responsibility of the borrower, except where \nState law requires the mortgagee to record or fil e the satisfaction.  \nIf the entire principal of the loan is refunded after the loan is closed, the borrower must \npay interest from the date of the note to the date of receipt of the refund.  \nThe Agency may collect any account balance that results from an error by the Agency in \nhandling final payments.  \n4-4 \n  ",

The Agency may charge borrowers overage and withhold rental assistance payments for units without a valid and current tenant certification.  These requirements protect the Government\u2019s interest by ensuring that only eligible units benefit from Agency subsidy payments.  They also protect tenants\u2019 interest by reserving subsi dy benefits for those who actually qualify for them.  \n4.11   GENERAL PROCEDURES  \nA.  Timely Submission and Overage Charges for Late Submissions  \nBorrowers must submit tenant certifications for new tenants and required \nrecertifications for existing tenants no later than the tenth day of the month for the \ncertification to be effective for that month.  This deadline applies regardless of whether the certifications are being submitted through electronic transmission or in hard copy.  Tenant certifications received after the tenth day of the month will be considered late. Borrowers are not eligible for interest credit or rental assistance for units with late certifications, and the Agency will charge the appropriate amount of overage until valid certifications are received in a timely manner for all units.  \nThe tenth -day-of-the-month deadline applie s regardless of whether the late \ncertification in question relates to a new certification or a recertification.  Any changes to tenant certifications that are effective as of the first day of the month must be submitted to the Agency by the tenth day of that month for the affected units to qualify for interest credit or rental assistance.  If the changes are submitted after the tenth day of the month, the Agency will charge overage and the changes will be effective the first day of the following month.  The Agency may remove a management agent if there is a pattern of failure to submit tenant certifications on time that results in excessive overage charges.  \nB.  Waivers of Overage  \nThe Leadership Designee  may grant a waiver of overage charges resulting only from \nthe late submission of tenant certifications in the following instances: \n\u2022 Circumstances existed that were beyond the borrower\u2019s control (e.g., natural disaster or undetected transmission failures due to network interruption);  \n      4-5 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623 ",

For \neach waiver requested, the borrower must provide a written explanation of the \ncircumstances that caused the late submission of the tenant certification, proof that these circumstances were beyond the borrower\u2019s control and a description of the actions taken to prevent the situation from occurring in the future. \nTo recommend the approval of a request for waiver of overage, the Servicing Official \nwill attach a completed copy of  Form RD 3560- 23, Multi -Family Housing Waiver of \nOverage, to the borrower\u2019s request and forward to the Leadership Designee .  Only the \nLeadership Designee  has the authority to grant a waiver of overage.  Once the waiver is \napproved, the  MFH Servicing official  is responsible for making the appropriate entries in \nAMAS and MFIS.  \nIf a request for waiver of overage is denied, the charge must be paid as a borrower \nexpense.  With prior Agency approval, nonprofit borrowers and cooperatives may treat the charge as a project expense.  If a request for an overage waiver is denied, the borrower will be given appeal rights. \nC.  Verification and Processing of Certifications  \nIn the case of projects with eight units or more, Borrowers are required to provide the \ndata for all tenant certification forms to the Agency through electronic transmission via MINC. Borrowers with less than eight units may submit hard copies.    The MFH Servicing official  process es these transmissions through the Industry Interface page of \nMFIS, providing assistance where needed with rejected entries.  In the event of the receipt of hard copies of Form RD 3560- 8, the MFH Servicing official  will process \nmanually the data into MFIS.  MFIS calculates interest credit and rental assistance due the borrower, as well as overage due the Agency in cases of late certifications.  These calculations are reflected on Form RD 3560- 29.  All subsidy payments are based on \ntenants\u2019 occupying the units as of the first day of the month prior to the payment due date.  For example, a payment due on July 1 is based on tenants\u2019 occupying the units June 1. \nThe MFH Servicing official  verifies the accuracy of the tenant data transmitted by the \nborrower through a random review of selected tenant files during the Supervisory Visit.  Corrective action is initiated for any discrepancies revealed during this review.  \n4-6 \n  ",
  "page_89": "HB-3-3560  \nD.  Approval of Subsidy \nThe Agency will certify for interest credit or rental assistance only those tenants with \ncurrent tenant certifications showing on MFIS when payments are being processed.  \nMFIS retains a copy of Form RD 3560- 29, to document the approved subsidies.   \nSECTION 3:  LOAN PAYMENT PROCESSING  \n4.12   OVERVIEW  \nThe Agency processes loan payments and subsidy requests according to the servicing and \ncollection requirements of the individual loan.  The requirements are established by the loan agreement or loan resolution, and Form RD 3560- 52.  There are a number of steps common to \nthe processing of any loan payment, as outlined below. \n4.13   NOTIFICATION TO BORROWERS OF PAYMENTS DUE  \nA.  Factors Used to Determine Payment Amount  \nThe amount of each borrower\u2019s monthly payment is automatically calculated by \nMFIS based on the tenant information received from the borrower and summarized on \nForm RD 3560- 29.  The Agency  releases this form to MINC on or about the seventeenth \nday of the month, where borrowers are able to view and approve the information for processing.  \nB.  Calculating Payment Amount  \nTo determine the amount of the payment that is due from the borrower, MFIS sums \nthe total of the following components:  \n\u2022 Audit receivables (e.g., excess rental as sistance, unauthorized assistance) as \ndetermined by MFIS;  \n\u2022 Late fees as determined by AMAS;  \n\u2022 Unamortized cost items (e.g., taxes, insurance, protective advances) as determined by AMAS;  \n\u2022 Amortized cost item loan installments as determined by AMAS and reflected on the \nMFIS Form RD 3560- 29 (included in the project payment) and in the project payment \namount on Form RD 3560- 29; \n\u2022 Overage; and  \n\u2022 Debt service (i.e., interest and principal as determined by AMAS).  \nNote that audit receivables and cost items may be either unamortized or amortized.

The remaining balance is the net \namount due. \nExhibit 4- 1 illustrates how rental assistance and overage are calculated and the impact \nthey have on the tenant\u2019s rent and the borrower\u2019s loan payment.  If the amount of rental \nassistance exceeds the borrower\u2019s loan payment, the Agency will make a rental assistance payment to the borrower.

Subsidy \ncredit will be applied first to accrued interest and then to principal after all interest is paid.  Subsidy credit will not be applied to late fees, audit receivables, or recoverable cost charges;  \n\u2022 After a payment has been processed, any change in application that does not \ninvolve changes in cash may be made in the Servicing Office by properly trained and certified staff.  If changes need to be made in a cash field, the AMAS Coordinator can process t he charge after performing a cursory review of account \ninformation; and \n\u2022 Make modifications to the payment as necessary.  Some examples of situations \nwhere modifications might be made include wrong date of credit, key punch errors, incorrect recording of rental assistance, and duplicate payments (see AMAS instructions for more information).  \nWhen a borrower remits a payment, AMAS will net enough rental assistance to bring \nthe account status current and pay any unpaid overage, late fees, or interest on delinquent principal based on the date payment is received.  If the account is on or ahead of  schedule \nwhen the payment is received, enough rental assistance will be netted to pay one full installment and any unpaid overage, interest, or other obligation. \nB.  Borrower Submission  \nBorrowers must prepare and submit Form RD 3560- 29 providing the following \ninformation:  \n\u2022 Only tenants\u2019 occupying units the first day of the month prior to the payment due \ndate;  \n\u2022 Interest credit and rental assistance only for tenants with current tenant certifications;  \n\u2022 Overage up to the market rent that must be paid to the Agency by the borrower for tenants without current tenant certifications unless there is a formal eviction in process.

Advance regular payments are applied as such only \n4-12 ",
  "page_95": "HB-3-3560  \nwhen the loan account is current.  The payment effective date will be the due date of the \nnext regular payment that is not fully paid.

The \nAgency charges late fees on PASS payments received after the tenth day of the month.  The \nFinance Office automatically notifies each borrower of late fees for PASS payments that were outstanding as of the tenth day of the month.

Agency Approval of Waivers Procedures for Granting Late Fee Waivers  \nWaivers to late fee charges may be granted only as follows:  \n\u2022 The Leadership Designee  may grant a waiver for as many late fee charges as are \njustified by the facts of the case, based on a determination that the late fees would place an unfair burden on the borrower.  For each waiver requested, the borrower must provide a written explanatio n of the circumstances that caused the late payment, \nproof that they were beyond the borrower\u2019s control, and a description of what actions will be taken to bring the account current.  Waivers are granted on a case -by-case \nbasis;  \n\u2022 There are only two circumstances under which the Agency will grant a waiver to late \nfees.  The first is when the borrower is a board- managed nonprofit or cooperative, \nbecause they are the only entities on which the assessment of late fees would place an unfair burden.  The second is where the Agency has agreed to accept deferred payments or partial payments as part of an approved workout agreement.  In such cases, the Leadership Designee  can grant as many waivers as are justified by the facts \nof the case (i .e., there is no annual limit on the number of waivers that may be \ngranted);  \n4-13 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623 \n  ",

Required Submissions from Borrower to Receive a Waiver  \nBorrowers must submit a number of items to the Agency in order to receive a waiver.  \nThese include:  \n\u2022 A written explanation of the circumstances that caused the late payment;  \n\u2022 A description of the factors beyond the borrower\u2019s control (e.g., natural disaster); and  \n\u2022 A description of the actions that will be taken to bring the account current.  \nIf the late payment is due to Agency error, the borrower need not submit the above -\nlisted items.  In such cases, providing notification to the Agency of its error will suffice, and loan services will promptly correct the error in the appropriate automated system(s).  \nC.

Recoverable and Nonrecoverable Cost Items  \nThe MFH Servicing official  will service recoverable and nonrecoverable cost items \naccording to the procedures outlined in 7 CFR 3560.403 and RD  Instruction 2024- A. \n \nSECTION 4:  ACCOUNT TRACKING AND SERVICING  \n4.18   OVERVIEW  \nThe Agency must track borrower accounts to ensure that all payments are up- to-date and \nto identify any problems that could lead to delinquencies or defaults.  Any transaction that affects \nan account must be tracked to ensure that it has been processed corr ectly and that it has not had a \nnegative impact on the interests of the borrower, tenants, or the Government. \nThe Agency has sought to facilitate and standardize the account tracking process by \nrequiring that all new loans, and many existing loans, be closed and serviced using PASS.  \n4.19   ACCOUNT TRACKING PROCEDURES  \nA.  Conditions for Conversion from DIAS to PASS  \nConversion of accounts from DIAS to PASS may be either voluntary or involuntary.   \nAn involuntary conversion may occur at the time of a servicing action such as a subsequent loan, transfer, or reamortization.  In such cases, the MFH Servicing official  \ncompletes Form RD 3560- 50, Conversion Agreement, and submits it to the State AMAS \nCoordinator for entry into AMAS.  The terms for the converted loan will be the same as for the original loan.  \nB.  Procedures for Conversion from DIAS to PASS  \nThe following actions must be taken to convert an account from DIAS to PASS:  \n\u2022 The MFH Servicing official  will complete Form RD 3560- 50, except for loans \nconverted on Form RD 3560- 21, Assumption Agreement , or Form RD 3560 -16, \nReamortization Agreement  (which converts the account to PASS);  \n\u2022 When the borrower will continue to receive interest credit following conversion, the current interest credit plan type will be passed through to the PASS loan.

Account Reviews  \nThe foundation for proper and timely debt payment is sound budgeting and monthly \nreview of income and expenses by the borrower and, as necessary, by MFH Servicing \nofficial s.  Account maintenance must begin with initial planning and must be an integral \npart of ongoing analysis, planning, and follow -up management assistance.  \nMFH Servicing official s must review each loan account at least monthly by accessing \nAMAS and carefully reviewing the status screens showing account status and other \nrelevant account information.  Accounts that are 30 days past due are subject to special servicing actions, as outlined in Paragraph 4.21 and in Chapter 10 of this handbook. \n4.20   SERVICING ACCOUNTS THAT ARE 30 DAYS PAST DUE  \nWhen tracking borrowers\u2019 accounts, MFH Servicing official s must identify all accounts \nthat are 30 days past due.  The MFH Servicing official  will service these delinquent accounts \naccording to the procedures in this handbook, with guidance and assistance as necessary from the \nLeadership Designee .  If a borrower\u2019s delinquency is not corrected by the time the account is 60 \ndays past due, the Agency initiates legal action to cure the borrower\u2019s default.  In such cases, MFH Servicing official s will follow the p rocedures described in Chapter 10 and any additional \nprocedures established by the Leadership Designee  for the particular type of loan.  \n4.21   SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES  \nA.  Same Terms Transfers  \nSame terms transfers, when the transferor has been converted to PASS, must take \nplace in a current loan status on the date of the transfer.  Borrowers must bring current any delinquent principal and interest before the conversion can occur.  \nB.  Overpayments and Advance Regular Payments  \nOverpayments and advance regular payments made on PASS accounts result in the \ncreation of a \u201cfuture paid\u201d status account under AMAS.  MFH Servicing official s must \nreverse and apply such advance payments to the transferor\u2019s principal balance prior to determining the loan balance to be transferred.  If the future payments have been made through RA, they must be refunded to the transferor and reapplied in the fo rm of cash on \nthe loan balance.  \n4-16 \n ",

The Agency\u2019s procedures ensure that payments are received in the proper amount and suitable form, that security instruments are released only when all obligations are satisfied, and that special circumstances are handled appropriately.  \nBefore the MFH Servicing official  begins the final loan payment process, they must \ndetermine if the final loan payment is a prepayment, as covered in Chapter 15.  If the final payment is an advanced payment of the account, the borrower must complete the prepayment process as outlined in 7 CFR part 3560, subpart N, and Chapter 15 of this handbook before the \nAgency will process a final loan payment.   \n4.23   PROCESSING FINAL LOAN PAYMENTS  \nThere are a number of steps that MFH Servicing official s must follow when accepting \nand processing a final loan payment. \nA.  Payment Amount Determined  \nThe MFH Servicing official  will obtain and provide to the borrower the amount to be \ncollected for payment in full of all loans by accessing the relevant AMAS status inquiry screens . MFH Servicing officials  will furnish requests for payoff balances on all accounts \nin writing.  Such requests require verification of the payoff amount by two employees . \nB.  Funds from Supervised Bank Account  \nWhen a borrower is ready to pay a loan in full, MFH Servicing official s must \nwithdraw any funds remaining in the supervised bank account for the initial loan and remit this amount for application to the borrower\u2019s account.  Note:   This requirement \ndoes not include the supervised bank account for reserves.  Any amount remaining in the reserve account above the required level and unused is the borrower\u2019s money and may be released to the borrower following receipt of the initial paym ent. \nC.  Forms Processed  \nWhen the Agency  receives final payment, the MFH Servicing official  processes it in \nAMAS as a paid -in-full payment.

If not, the Agency will release the documents after a 30- day waiting period. \n2.  Loans Secured by Both Real Estate and Chattels  \nIf a loan secured by both real estate and chattels is paid in full, the chattel security \ninstrument will be satisfied or released by the MFH Servicing official  in accordance with \nRD Instruction 1962- A. \n3.  Loans Where Mortgagee Is Required to Record or File a Satisfaction  \nIf State law requires the mortgagee to record or file a satisfaction, the Agency will do \nso consistent with the State supplement.

For instance, partnerships \nmay dissolve, or substitute individuals or entities may obtain an ownership interest in a property due to business reorganizations, retirements, or other reasons.  To  address these situations, the \nAgency has developed requirements and procedures for receiving notification of and reviewing \nproposed changes, as well as granting approval for such changes to ensure that the Agency\u2019s \nsecurity interest is protected.  \nThis chapter covers the Agency\u2019s requirements regarding changes in a borrower\u2019s \nownership structure and Agency procedures for reviewing and accepting such changes. \n5.2   OVERVIEW OF CHANGES REQUIRING PRIOR AGENCY CONSENT  \nThe Agency imposes specific requirements on certain proposed changes in the structure \nof the borrower entity to ensure the adequacy of the new or substitute interests and thus protect \nthe interests of tenants and the Government.  \nThe Agency requires that borrowers obtain prior Agency consent to organizational \nchanges involving the controlling interests of the borrower entity to ensure that such changes will continue to serve the needs of tenants and protect the interest of the Gove rnment.  For example, \nif one partner in a borrower entity decides to sell their interest to a new individual from outside the existing organizational structure, the Agency needs to review that individual\u2019s prior history and qualifications to ensure that the person is eligible to participate in the program (i.e., is not under suspension, debarred, under Office of the Inspector General (OIG) review, or known to be \nin default on any Agency loan[s]).  The purpose of this review is to evaluate that the borrower entity will continue to be eligible under program requirements and that any changes in the organizational structure do not adversely affect the Agency\u2019s security interests.  \n5.3   REQUIREMENTS FOR OBTAINING AGENCY CONSENT  \nA.  Overview  \nCertain changes in the structure and ownership interests in the borrower entity require \nAgency consent before they become effective.  These include:  \n\u2022 Any changes in the controlling interests of the borrower entity;  \n\u2022 Changes in the ownership interests of the borrower entity that involve the transfer of \nstock to any individual or organization not previously listed in the ownership \ndocuments submitted to the Agency; or  \n5-1 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623 \nRevised (03-31-25)  PN 636 ",

Next, \nthey perform a review to determine whether the new individuals or organizations \nproposed meet eligibility criteria (i.e., the same criteria required to qualify for a new \nAgency loan as set forth i n the HB -1-3560).  To determine that approval of the \ntransaction will not adversely affect the objectives of the loan or the property, the Leadership Designee must consider past performance, experience, qualifications, and abilities of any individual or organization obtaining an interest in the borrower organization.  Finally, MFH Servicing officials  review all documentation to determine if \nthe substitute general partners propose to assume all liability that had been assumed by the withdrawing entity.  \nWhen the initial review has been completed, MFH Servicing officials  process and \nsubmit Form  RD 3560- 1 to the Leadership Designee , who either approves or rejects the \nproposed transfers or changes.  In cases where proposed membership changes are not covered in the organizational documents or appear to be in conflict with applicable regulatory requirements, MFH Servicing officials  may submit case files to OGC for \nreview and concurrence regarding a borrower\u2019s legal sufficiency to assume the proposed role in the  new organization.  OGC does not override the decisions made by the Agency \nwith regard to organizational changes. \n5.6   DOCUMENTATION OF CHANGES  \nTo ensure that there is a running history of all changes made to the organization of a \nborrower entity, the Agency requires that all changes be adequately documented through both written notification to borrowers and maintenance of case files.  MFH Servicing officials  must \nrespond to all requests for Agency consent to changes in a formal letter, a copy of which is placed in the borrower\u2019s case file.  Documentation allows the Agency to track the legality of the changes and the suitability of any new individuals or organizations added to the borrower entity over time.

The goal of the assessment is to position the property for long term \nviability and participation in RD programs.  Preservation of RD assets should be prioritized as an outcome of the property assessment, using all RD preservation and asset servicing tools at our disposal to achieve a preservation outcome.  \nMany of the  property and marketing factors  that support the P ortfolio A ssessment will also provide \nindications of whether a property should remain in the program or be removed .

Health or safety issues are most often identified or documented during a \nphysical inspection or environmental assessment of the property.  While a majority of violations can be fixed through maintenance, repairs, or even a rehabilitation loan to pay for rehabilitation, some violations are more difficult to resolve.  A compliance violation that is identified on the P hysical Inspection R eport may be considered a health \nor safety issue.  However, most of these violations will never lead to a concern of suitability.  For example, broken windows, a leaking roof, or exposed wiring are all easily corrected if funds are available.  Health or safety issues that do affect suitability will likely pertain to the entire property and either cannot be repaired, or repair is too costly.  For example, a property with a damaged and unst able \nfoundation may not be repairable or repaired at an expense beyond that which is fiscally responsible.  \n Consider whether the property is experiencing problems that are of a health or safety nature that the owner/management has been unsuccessful in resolving.  This may involve a recurring condition and/or a situation that the owner/management has failed to adequately address.  Some health or safety issues such as structural problems and extensive mold may be so pervasive that there is no financially- feasible \nremediation, at which point the account may need to be accelerated.  \n Factor 4 :  Physical Standards/Obsolesce.  Determine whether there is evidence of physical deterioration \nand extensive deferred maintenance.  Signs of physical stress are unresolved physical condition problems identified during annual inspections or supervisory visi ts (also known as \u201copen physical \nfindings\u201d), media reports of the property\u2019s poor conditions , and tenant complaints. \n The MFH Servicing official  must also determine whether the problem can be solved through special \nservicing, workout agreement, or revitalization funding or that solving the problem is not in the Agency\u2019s best financial interest.  \n If the issues from any of these property and marketing factors are not addressed in a timely manner, the property may be considered obsolete as compared to similar properties in the market area.  The MFH Servicing official  must also consider the issue of need when determining if a property is obsolete.  The \noutcome of the need determination does not affect the result of the obsolescence determination, but it may influence how the Agency implements the result.  Exhibit 6- 3 lists helpful questions to use in \nmaking this determination. \n There are three reasons that a prope rty may be considered obsolete:  \n \n\u2022 The property poses a health or safety risk to the tenants;  \n\u2022 The building has structural or design characteristics that make the property economically infeasible; or  \n\u2022 The site is no longer economically viable because of local economic conditions (such as the transportation infrastructure).  \n   \n6-6 ",
  "page_112": " HB-3-3560  \n \nThe MFH Servicing official  should go through the following process to determine if the property (i.e., \nthe site and the building) poses a health or safety threat, has physical characteristics that cannot be addressed economically, or faces adverse local economic co nditions. \n Physical characteristics that make the property obsolete or economically infeasible are usually documented either through a physical inspection or with a market study.  \n Factor 5 :  Transition Events .  Identify whether the property is eligible to prepay the mortgage; is \nreaching the expiration of tax credit eligibility; or is coming up on the natural maturity of the mortgage.  Factor 6 :  Revitalization Cost vs. New Construction/Replacement Cost .  Consider the cost to \nrehabilitate the property compared to building a new, comparable property.  The Agency\u2019s  share of \nrehabilitation costs, including a rehabilitation loan and the cost of revitalization loan tools if available, should not exceed 50 percent of the cost of new construction.  The property may still be needed in the market, but it is too expensive for Rural Development to fund.  Conversely, preservation funding may not be available even for a property for which the Agency\u2019s  \nportion of the  cost is less than 50 percent. \n An alternative to consider is subordinating the Agency\u2019s  position to enable the B orrower to obtain \nrehabilitation financing from a third -party.  Low -Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC) are one form of \nfinancing.  Subordinations can only occur if the requirements of 7 CFR \u00a73560.409 are met.  \n  \n                  \n \n6-7 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623  ",

Data on \nenvironmental \nconditions.   \u2022 The need for an environmental review, assessment, or due \ndiligence is based on the condition of the property and must be conducted in accordance with RD Instruction 1970 Part .   \n\u2022 Due diligence is to be accomplished prior to appraisal to assure that any adverse conditions are considered in valuation.   \n\u2022 In cases when contamination is found, the State Environmental \nCoordinator should be consulted on further actions.  \n2.

  "page_115": " \n \n   HB-3-3560  \n \nFactor 7:   Market Demand/Vacancy Rates.  Consider whether the market demand for the property has \ndecreased significantly creating a high vacancy rate, i.e. a rate in excess of 15 percent over the last two years.  The high vacancy rate may have resulted in a lack of  adequate cash flow, and drained the \nproperty of financial resources.   Determine whether there are other RD -financed properties within the \nmarket area (e.g., the county) or within a reasonable distance from the property, and whether those properti es are also experiencing high vacancy rates.  \n If other RD -financed properties are experiencing high vacancies, the MFH Servicing official  should \nconsider which of the properties in that market area should be considered for Category 3.  Evaluate the status of waiting lists, unit turnover frequency, and downtime so that the remaining portfoli o will have \nsufficient demand.  \n The MFH Servicing official  should have the following information to determine need:  \n \n1) The Agency should obtain a market study.  If the Agency has a market study covering the property area that is less than 12 months old, the MFH Servicing official  may use this market \nstudy and update  any information as necessary.  \n2) If not included in the market study, the MFH Servicing official  may need to obtain local \neconomic indicators, such as local employment and economic trends to judge the short - and \nlong- term prospects for change.  \n3) The MFH Servicing official  should have the property\u2019s updated budget, including a record of \naccounts receivable and accounts payabl e. \n4) The MFH Servicing official  should also seek community input to get information on the \ncommunity\u2019s interest in retaining the property and the community perception of the need for the \nproperty.  \n There are two components to the needs analysis:  impact and economic viability.  The MFH Servicing official  must consider both components to determine if there is a need for a property.  \n The Agency  must determine if removing the property from the portfolio would have a negative impact \non tenants.  This analysis is the same impact analysis as conducted in response to a prepayment request.  See Chapter 15 of this Handbook for a detailed discussion on determining impact.  The objective of this analysis is to determine if tenants will lose their units, suffer from rent overburden, or be unable to find comparable housing in the community if the designation is changed.  \n Also consider whether the property is located in close proximity to other subsidized, affordable housing units (Tax Credit, Section 538 Guaranteed Rural Rental Housing, Section 8, or even market -rate \nproperties) that, in effect, reduce the demand for RD -financed property units, i.e., the need for the \nproperty is no longer there.  This condition may be ongoing, or the property may be just beginning to experience vacancies as a result of new development within the immediate vicinity.  \n    \n6-10 ",
  "page_116": " HB-3-3560  \n \nConsider, for this specific property, what is the true market area:  i.e., where would existing tenants go for new housing?  Include consideration of the Rural Development Voucher Program, the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s ( HUD)  Section 8, tax credit, etc., which is available \nto low -income tenants of Section 515 properties that prepay or are foreclosed by the Agency.  \n Consider whether the property was located in an eligible rural area when constructed but, due to population growth, is now located in an ineligible area.  \n Determine whether there is still a market need for this property, now likely to be in a high rent area.  If the property has a vacancy problem, it may be an indication of a lack of market need for the property, or it could indicate a management problem.  \n If subsidy is no longer needed for the benefit of tenants the Agency  may, upon written notice, suspend, \nmodify or terminate the Interest C redit A greement for the property, using form RD -3560- 9 \u201cMultiple \nFamily Housing Interest Credit Agreement \u201d. \n Consider whether the property is located in an area that is in the process of or has experienced a significant population change that has a negative effect on its continued successful operation.  \n Examples include:  \n \n1) the population in the area has declined, which likely will reduce the demand for housing;  \n2) the population will decline in the future, likely reducing housing demand in the coming years; and  \n3) a local factor that will reduce population or housing demand such as a plant closing that causes families to move out of the area, the effects of a natural disaster, and/or an economic crisis impacting the area.  \n Population change could also be an increase.  To the extent that this information is available, consider the population age groups that have increased or decreased as this may affect the market for the property.  In some areas, the overall population is st able but the portion of the population that is most \nlikely to use RD -financed properties is declining, and this will negatively affect housing demand.  \n           \n6-11 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623   ",
  "page_117": " \n \n   HB-3-3560  \n \nThe MFH Servicing official  should use the market study to consider the following:  \n \n\u2022 The tenant\u2019s ability to stay in the property.  This analysis depends on the proposed use of the \nproperty after leaving the program and CRCU ; \n\u2022 The availability of alternative housing if the proposed use of the property or increase in rents will \ncause rent overburden.  The alternative housing must be comparable in size, amenities, and rent to keep property tenants in the local community; and \n\u2022 If the property has RA , the MFH Servicing official  must identify comparable units with RA  or \nother rental subsidies, such as HUD Section 8. \n Factor 8:   Economic Viability .  Consider whether the property is economically viable.  Does it have a \ndifficult time generating sufficient income to pay essential expenses, fund the reserve account, and make loan payments?  Evaluate financial stresses on the property and their cause, and consider whether they can be resolved.  \n The MFH Servicing official  must determine if the property is economically viable.  If the property  \ncannot generate sufficient income to pay essential expenses, fund accounts, and make loan payments -  \ndespite appropriate loan servicing actions, budgeting, and marketing -  the property may no longer be \neconomically viable.  Economic viability problems are usually associated with a change in local economic conditions and the inability of the property to maintain a sufficient occupancy rate even with aggressive marketing.   \n For example, if a 20 -unit property has a 50 percent vacancy rate and has been steadily losing tenants as \nthe area\u2019 s population declines due to the closing of a factory, the property  may not be economically \nviable.  It may not be in the Agency\u2019s interest to spend limited resources on a property that cannot meet \nthe financial requirements of the program.  Physical characteristics of a property that impact on viability are considered under obsolescence, but utilize the same basic analysis.  \n Types of questions to consider regarding economic viability include:  \n \n\u2022 Has the market changed due to changing demographics or local economic conditions such that there is no longer demand for the units?  \n\u2022 Is there a need for a different bedroom mix than the property has to offer?  \n\u2022 In the case of Section 514 on- farm Farm Labor Housing, is the operator still farming?  \n\u2022 Have there been significant vacancies that cannot be reduced with aggressive marketing?  \n         \n6-12 ",

The market study should identify any known changes in \nthe local economy to assist the MFH Servicing official  in understanding the short - and medium -\nterm impacts.

Transfer of any RD project \nrequires  RD\u2019s  prior  approval. RD may approve  a project  transfer  [7 CFR 3560.406 (b)] if that \nproject continues to further the objectives of the program, if the transaction  is in the best \ninterest of Government and the tenants, and if RD\u2019s security is protected.  \n \nThe Agency's Transfer Application Process (TAP) strives to balance the needs of RD \nand its customers.  This chapter elaborates on Agency policies and defines thresholds to \naccomplish  this goal. The Agency review  process  relies on accurate  information  being  timely \nprovided from  all parties.  This chapter  outlines  the requirements  for project transfers  and RD\u2019s \nprocedures for reviewing and approving those transfers.  \n \nThe programs  covered  by this Chapter  and authorized  by Title  V of the Housing Act \nof 1949 are as follows:  \n \n1. Section  515 Rural  Rental  Housing (RRH)  that includes  congregate  housing, group \nhomes, and Rural Cooperative Housing as defined in \u00a73560.11; and  \n \n2. Section  514 Farm  Labor  Housing (FLH)  loans  and Section  516 FLH  grants  for \nfarm -worker housing.  \n \nA transferee must meet the eligibility requirements found in HB -1-3560 for the \nrespective loan program type (RRH or FLH) as defined in 7 CFR\u00a73560.55 and \u00a73560.555, \nincluding  possessing  the financial  capacity  and management  experience to successfully  own and \nmanage the project. After a transfer is authorized, the property should be financially and \noperationally sustainable for the remaining term of the RD funding. The property should \nprovide adequate, affordable, decent,  safe, and  sanitary rental units for very low -, low -, and \nmoderate -income households in rural areas.  \n \nTo protect RD\u2019s security interests in a transfer, the RD underwriter must perform the \nevaluations  outlined  in this chapter, taking into account  the requirements  in Chapters 4 and 5 \nof HB-1-3560 and considering the impact  of the transaction  on the tenants. While  transfers \noffer an opportunity to improve the quality of housing through improved maintenance, \nrehabilitation,  and/or  better  management,  if not properly scrutinized,  a transfer may increase the \nrisk of loan default or poorer housing conditions.  \n \nFor purposes  of this chapter, the term applicant,  transferee,  or purchaser  is used to refer \nto the entity  that wishes to acquire  the property, and borrower, transferor,  or seller  refers  to the \ncurrent borrower, or the entity transferring the property.  \n \nFor additional  guidance  on loan restructuring, see Chapter  11 of this Handbook.

Objectives  \nThe key objective of this chapter is to ensure RD Multi -Family Housing (MFH) \nprojects continue to meet long -term program goals stated below by maintaining the \naffordability of needed rental housing in rural areas.  This chapter guides the Loan \nServicer/underwriter and the applicant  in evaluating  transfer  requests  to ensure  the transaction \nmeets the best interests  of the Government  and the tenants by: \n \n1. Improving  and maintaining  the long- term physical  and financial  viability  of the \nproperty;  \n \n2. Improving  or maintaining  the affordability  of the property  for RD-eligible  tenants \nand applicants;  \n3. Completing the transaction  in a timely  and efficient manner; and  \n4. Providing a framework  for the timely  and consistent  review  of the applicant\u2019s \nsubmission subject to the applicable program and statutory requirements.  \nB. Responsibilities  \nRD relies on the ability of underwriter and loan originator (hereinafter used \ninterchangeably and in those cases they may be designated as a MFH specialist and may \nfurther serve as the loan servicer)  to complete  the basic eligibility  determinations  concerning \nboth the applicant/borrower and the project to ensure the transaction complies with the \nrespective MFH program authorities described in current RD Handbooks, Code of Federal \nRegulations (CFR), and statutory authorities.  It is RD\u2019s responsibility to fully evaluate the \nproposal and determine when the transaction meets applicable Agency administrative and \nprogram requirements.  In those cases where the RD underwriter and RD loan servicer are \ntwo different individuals, they will jointly be involved in processing the loan transfer and \nshare accountability for successfully completing the transfer by fulfilling the actions \ndescribed in this Chapter. All transfers and Multi -Family Housing Preservation and \nRevitalization (MPR) Transactions must be in the best interests of the Government and \ntenants.  These transactions must demonstrate the extended viability/sustainability of the \nproject,  the likelihood of full repayment  under  the terms  being offered, and the probability of \nproviding and maintaining quality affordable housing over the long- term.  \n \nThe Applicant is responsible for providing complete, timely and accurate information \nand documentation throughout the transfer process to comply with all of the applicable program policies, procedures, and regulations. The Loan  Servicer  is typically  the initial point  of \ncontract  when  a borrower  decides  to transfer  their property and will determine  if the  transfer meets \nthese objectives subject to the applicable program and statutory requirements. If a transfer \ndoes not meet  each of these objectives,  the Loan  Servicer  should work  with the purchaser  and \nthe seller  in an effort to resolve  issues  of concern  within  the respective program  limitations.  If \nthe applicant contacts the RD underwriter who is not also the designated loan servicer, the underwriter will inform the servicer and initiate the cooperative effort necessary to comply  \n ",
  "page_130": "HB-3-3560  \n  \nwith the process described  in this Chapter.  It is not RD\u2019s  role to assume any responsibility  for \nthe individual business decisions of the borrower or applicant in ultimately determining the \ncourse of action they propose. RD does not negotiate the terms of the transaction that are \nbetween the buyer and seller.  \nC. Guiding  Principles  \nAgency underwriters  will use the currently  available  underwriting analysis  and guides \navailable at the RD intranet (SharePoint) https://mfhdemoteam.sc.egov.usda.gov/  \nProgTracking/  default.aspx to document their MFH transfer and MPR decisions. Applicants \nand borrowers may access these forms through the appropriate RD public websites (http://www.rd.usda.gov/programs -services/multi- family -housing- direct -loans  or \nhttp://www.rd.usda.gov/programs -services/housing -preservation -revitalization - \ndemonstration- loans -grants ). \n \nThe key parties to the transfer  include  the Seller,  the Purchaser,  the Agency (on behalf \nof the tenants and as mortgagor), and any third- party funders (other lenders, tax credit \nagencies, syndicators/investors, etc.).  The different parties may have competing or  \nconflicting requirements, needs, and/or objectives and goals that must be recognized and \naddressed early in the transfer process.  RD is not responsible for reconciling conflicts \nbetween buyers, seller or any other interested third parties.  RD may, within its policy \nconstraints  and to protect  the interest of the Government  and the tenants,  offer alternatives  for \nconflict resolution.  \n \nAn initial or preliminary conceptual meeting with the RD loan servicer, Seller, and \nPurchaser should be arranged as early in the process as possible to evaluate the potential suitability of the proposed transfer and formulate a mutually acceptable schedule for RD's internal program  analysis.  This meeting  can also identify  potential  problems  or issues early  in \nthe process that will need to be addressed before completing the transfer application.  \n \nWhen initiating the conceptual discussion, RD should recommend to applicants the \nuse of RD\u2019s optional Preliminary Assessment Tool (PAT) or a suitable preliminary \nassessment tool alternative offered by other parties, as a starting point to explore the \nfeasibility of the transaction.  Using the PAT encourages all interested parties to contact the \nRD servicing  office  as early  as possible  to discuss  program  requirements  and conditions. The \nPAT contains general instructions, basic underwriting thresholds and pertinent tips for RD customers and staff to assist in preparing and evaluating proposals.  The tool incorporates the \ndetailed instructions found in the applicable RD Handbooks, CFR, and other applicable \nAgency and Departmental regulations.  Additional instructions and suggestions are available \ninternally for Agency underwriters through the Agency SharePoint by drilling down to their \nspecific needs.  \n \nThe RD website (http://www.rd.usda.gov/programs -services/multi- family -housing-  \ndirect- loans ) includes the PAT along with many of the other tools and additional program \ninformation.  \n \nUsing  the information  provided by the applicant, Loan  Servicers should assess whether \nthe transfer request is consistent with the following guiding  principles:  \n1. There is a continuing need for the property in the community.  This should be \nconsidered  in lieu of prepayment  of any existing  RD direct  loan MFH  properties.  \n2. When  the transaction  is complete,  the property will be in the hands  of eligible \nowners.  \n \n \n7-4 ",

The transaction will address the immediate and long -term physical needs, \nincluding accessibility  issues identified  in a Transition  Plan as well as any other \nfair housing requirements, and other needs of the property.  \n \n4. Any increased  post-transaction  rents  will not displace existing  tenants otherwise \nmeeting the RD eligibility requirements for continued occupancy. \n \n5. Post-transaction basic rents will not exceed the lesser of conventional rents for \ncomparable  units  (CRCU),  or the restricted  rents  as defined  below  in Paragraph  D \n1, unless an exception is allowed by the Agency. Low Income Housing Tax \nCredits (LIHTC)  rents  are differentiated  from CRCU  and other  restricted  rents  that \nmay be imposed  by the applicant\u2019s  participation  in other  funding sources such as \nHOME  or individual  State  Housing Assistance programs.  See Paragraph  7.7 B. \n \n6. Any equity amount recognized by RD will be supported by a market value \nappraisal  meeting  RD appraisal  acceptability  and underwriting  requirements.  \n \n7. The RD-recognized  Seller's  Equity will consider  the Market  Value  reflected  in the \nRD-approved appraisal (See Paragraph 7.7 B) less the unpaid balance of the \noutstanding RD Loans on the Property and any other amortizing debt or other real \nestate secured liens outstanding at the time of transfer as determined appropriate \nby the Agency.

An Exit Incentive  (EI) can be paid to the Seller  if the following  tests are met: \na. The present  RD-accepted  market  value  appraisal  does not indicate any equity \nexists in the property as is;  \nb. All threshold items  in Paragraph  7.2 C of this handbook are met; \nc. The total amount  paid as EI is available from  tax credits  or other  soft dollars \n(RD funds will not be used to fund EI ); \nd. All New Loans  are used for eligible  RD MFH  program  purposes;  and \ne. All RD Direct Loans together with any RD authorized senior or superior debt, \nsuch as may be incurred when  the RD direct  loans  have  been  subordinated or \nwere  previously issued  in a junior  lien position, post transfer  will be less than \nthe Security Value determined by RD. \n \n9. The Seller\u2019s  Equity and any EI may not both be paid on the same  transfer.  When \nan EI is proposed, the RD HQ must review the PAT before RD issues a letter of \nsupport for the buyer to obtain tax credits. RD must also review the settlement \nstatement pre-  and post -closing to verify the amounts that may ultimately be \nreleased at closing, and confirm no more than the amount authorized has been allowed.  \n \n \n \n  ",

The PDLD concurs with the equity loan amounts and the new Return- To-Owner \n(RTO)  being  authorized  when  it exceeds the seller\u2019s  originally  authorized return, \nand coordinates the approval of all waivers for unique and non- recurring  \ncircumstances that fall outside  of the normal  transaction  principles,  RD HQ \napprovals, or revitalization -related policy issues.  \n \n11. RD encourages the use of third- party resources to secure adequate funding to \nsuccessfully complete transfers and associated revitalization efforts.  Such \nresources include Low Income Housing Tax Credits (LIHTC), grants, and \nparticipating lenders adhering to established RD MFH policies and programs, including Section  538, Guaranteed  Rural  Rental  Housing (GRRH)  loans. Lenders \ninclude Federally -regulated and insured institutions; State -regulated, chartered, \nand insured institutions; and other national, state, regional, or local governmental agencies specifically authorized to make loans and/or grants for multi -family \nhousing purposes authorized under the authorities accorded to USDA.  \n \n12. Post-transaction basic rents will not exceed the lesser of Conventional Rents for \nConventional Units (CRCU) or the restricted rents as defined below in Paragraph C 1, unless an exception is allowable or the rents are 100 percent Project -Based \nSection  8 with evidence  from HUD that the current  rents  will be carried  forward  to \nthe new borrower without anticipating any reduction for the remaining term of the Housing Assistance Payments Contract (HAP) contract.  See Paragraph 7.7 B. \n \n13. Each transfer will result in computation of a new Return -to-Owner (RTO) for the \nnew owner. Currently the RD RRH program allows the project owner to \npotentially earn its maximum return based on original loan terms and/or prior modification authorized by the Agency. A new RTO will replace the previous \nowner's  return  amount  in underwriting  and future  operating budgets  for the longest \nremaining term of any RD direct MFH loan on the property assumed, incurred or \nmodified as part of the transfer transaction.  \n \nFor transfers, the following conditions are considered in determining when any tax-credit  equity, projected -deferred  developer  fees, or other  program  adjustments \nwill be used to establish  the maximum total RTO  the new  owner  may be allowed:  \n \na. Rehabilitation costs eligible for the RD Section 515 Program purposes less all outstanding and new RD direct loans, together with any RD authorized senior \nor superior debt such as may be incurred when the RD direct loans have been subordinated or were  previously  issued  in a junior  lien position must  not exceed \nthe RD- determined Security Value;  \n \nb.

There  must  be a demonstrated  ability  to repay  any deferred  developer\u2019s  fee from \nthe NOI proposed by the applicant  at the time of RD underwriting  approval  for \nthe remaining  term of the RD loan using the rents  approved for the transaction \n(See Paragraph 7.2 B); and \n \nf. Each transfer request received by RD will be tracked by Agency underwriters \nand loan servicers throughout  the transfer process in the electronic  monitoring \nand tracking system prescribed by RD HQ.  \nD. Preliminary  Transfer Thresholds  \nRD adopted the following thresholds and policies for evaluating MFH transfer \nfeasibility to promote consistency in RD underwriting for MFH transfer transactions; and \nbalance the needs of the Agency, customers, and the project to maintain affordability for \neligible tenants under the RD programs.  The transferee should complete a preliminary \nassessment using these standards early in the transfer process and discuss it with the RD \noffice responsible for servicing the account.  Careful analysis by all parties involved can \nidentify the general issues that will need to be resolved as the transfer application is \ncompleted  and submitted  for formal review.  Acceptance of the preliminary  analysis by RD \ndoes not constitute final approval of any transfer proposal by RD or any other third -party \nfunder. Thresholds RD considers include:  \n \n1. Post-Transfer Rents.  Post-transfer rents should not exceed the restricted rents of \nthe LIHTC, HOME Program (if applicable), or CRCU (as defined in existing RD regulations), whichever is less.  The term Restricted Rents for the purpose of this \nreview will be the rent restrictions of LIHTC, HOME, or other Rent Restricting \nProgram(s) that will be placed on the property upon completion of the transfer. \nPost-transfer  rents  on properties  with 100 percent  Project- Based  Section  8 will not \nexceed the maximum rents authorized under the HAP contract. No rent increase \nbeyond the current basic rents is authorized prior to completion of the planned \nrehabilitation.  \n \n2. Rents Cash Flow in Proposed Operations. Proposed rents must be sufficient to \nmeet all projected expenses including a reasonable allowance for operations and \nincidentals, and are typically included in the estimated individual operating expense line items.  The allowance may be expressed as a percentage of total \noperating expenses and the resulting planned amount is reflected in the amount shown as net cash on the RD operating budget, Form RD 3560- 7, Part I, Line 30. \nThe minimum combined allowance for operating expenses and vacancy/bad debt loss must  not fall below  the equivalent  industry standard  of 5 percent  vacancy  loss \nor the applicable  amount  specified  in #3 below. Net operating income  (NOI)  must \nalso be sufficient to meet the general industry minimum standard of 1.15 Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR) for all amortizing debt being placed on the \nproperty in the initial underwriting review and authorization determination based \non the first year of typical operations (rents, O&M, etc.).  If third -party lenders  \n 7-7 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623 \n ",
  "page_134": "HB-3-3560 \n7-8  \n specifically  require  DSCR in excess of the minimum,  such rate should be used for \nRD underwriting analysis during the initial three operating years. See also # 9 \nbelow.  \n \n3. Vacancy/Bad  Debt  Loss.  The maximum  allowance  for vacancy  and bad debt is 10 \npercent (for 16 or more units) and 15 percent (for fewer than 16 units) unless \notherwise specified by terms of any supplemental Notice of Solicitation of Applications (NOSA) for which the transaction has been submitted. The \nminimum allowance  is the lesser  of the historical  average of collected  rents  for the \nmost recent three years plus 2 percent for bad debt, or the Restricted Rent Program/Lender requirement when specified.  If the budgeted allowance is less \nthan historical average plus 2 percent, it will be considered a failure to meet the \nrequired threshold unless extenuating circumstances can be supported and \ndocumented to RD\u2019s satisfaction.  \n \n4. Operating Expenses. The minimum amount of operating expenses required per \nunit is the greater of any specified by the Restricted Rent Program (LIHTC, HOME, etc.) or the third -party lender (if applicable).  Generally, project \nmaintenance costs are reduced as a result of the proposed rehab and generate a net reduction. However, any reduction must be reasonable. No more than a 10 percent change or variance in total project post -transfer closing operating expenses based \non historical  actual  averages will be accepted  for underwriting  without  an adequate \njustification acceptable to RD.  \n \n5. General Operating Account Minimum Requirement.  The project\u2019s General \nOperating Account (GOA) must be equal to 20 percent total operating expense as \nunderwritten at the time of transfer (excluding the required prorated tax and \ninsurance escrow), and there must not be any outstanding accounts payable exceeding  30 days. If this requirement  cannot  be achieved  through normal  project \noperations as reflected in the underwritten typical year budget, the transfer development budget must include an additional cash deposit to the GOA from non-debt, LIHTC or the applicant\u2019s non- project resources.  Any additional \nrequired deposit (not from normal operations) made by the applicant must be documented to the Agency at the time of transfer.  The applicant may recoup the \nadditional required cash deposit to the GOA between the second and seventh year \nof operation in accordance with HB -2-3560 Chapter 4, Section 1, 4.3. \n \n6. Tenant Protection. RD does not permit the intentional displacement of any \nexisting RD -eligible tenant because of the planned transfer, as long as the tenant \nremains eligible under RD regulations and the terms of the RD -approved lease. \nFor projects not having full Rental Assistance (RA) and for all non- RA assisted \nrevenue  units  where  the transfer results in a rent increase,  the applicant  must  agree \nto protect currently eligible tenants affected by the rent increase as long as the \ntenant resides in the project. All tenant protection costs must be included in the Sources and Uses analysis used in RD underwriting for the full amount needed to \nfund the initial two -year minimum period following the transfer closing for \ntransfer underwriting purposes. NOTE: This does not limit the total cost of tenant \nprotections the transferee may ultimately be responsible for and is solely to aid in \ncompleting  the initial transfer  underwriting analysis using the PAT.  The applicant \nwill establish a specific cash escrow set -aside for this purpose at the time of \nclosing, and is responsible for providing, from non- project resources, any future  \n \n \n ",

Capital  Needs  Assessment  (CNA)  Funding & Reserve Deposit. The minimum \nrequirement per unit is the greater of any Restricted Rent Program (LIHTC, HOME,  etc.) requirement,  or third -party  lender  (if applicable) requirement that \nwill be placed on the property upon completion of the transfer. The Reserve \nAccount ending balance forecast must be positive for all 20 years of CNA. \n \n8. New Loans for RD Section 515 Eligible Purposes. Any new loans placed on the \nproperty must be for Section 515 RRH -eligible loan purposes only, as defined in 7 \nCFR 3560.53. The Agency will analyze Federal Government and other assistance \nprovided to any MFH project to establish the maximum loan amount and to assure that the assistance is not more than the minimum necessary to make the housing \naffordable,  decent,  safe, and sanitary  to potential  tenants  [7 CFR 3560.63(d)]. Any \nprohibited uses of loan funds as defined in 7 CFR 3560.54 must be paid from  non- \ndebt sources. However, projects using a RD Section 538 Guaranteed Rural Rental \nHousing (GRRH) loan may be allowed additional debt for purposes eligible under \nthe GRRH regulations.  \n \n9. Debt Service Coverage Ratio (DSCR).  RD underwriting will include annual \ntrending increases of revenue at 2 percent and expenses at 3 percent (including reserve) for each of the first 15 years.  For transfer underwriting and analysis, the \nproject at a minimum must meet an initial DSCR of 1.15 through year 3, and may \nproject subsequent DSCRs of 1.1 in years 4 and 5, and 1.0 for the remaining years \nsolely  for the purposes  of the RD initial  transfer  analysis.  Third -party  lenders may \nrequire higher DSCR for their individual underwriting approval requirements.  If \nso, the DSCR required by the third- party lenders should be used in the RD \nunderwriting analysis during the initial 3 operating years.  \n \n10. Loan -to-Value.  Upon completion of all planned rehabilitation/repairs and \napproved development, all Debts must be secured within the Prospective As - \nImproved Security Value as defined by RD in 7 CFR 3560, \u00a73560.63. RD \ndetermines Security Value and includes the intangible benefits afforded by the \ninterest credit subsidy of the RD loans, and the benefits of other favorable \nfinancing resulting  from  other  Federal,  state or local  government  instrumentality \ndirect or authorized intermediary  lending programs  such as HOME,  Preservation \nRevolving Loan Fund (PRLF), and Section 538 GRRH loans being made at below -market rates and terms, as permitted by RD regulations.  Security Value \ndoes not include  any non-amortizing  or deferred  loans  or grants  regardless  of the \nsource; or any federal, state or local LHITC and Historic tax credits or the investment value thereof.  \n \n11. Loan Terms of Third -Party Debt. No balloon payment from any third -party debt \nis allowed prior to the expiration of the minimum RD Loan Term (30 years for RRH transfers and 33 years for FLH transfers), unless the Lender provides a written  agreement,  acceptable  to the Agency, to extend the scheduled maturity  on \nterms that do not require rents above comparable rents for comparable units (CRCU) through the term of the RD loan.  \n 7-9 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623 ",

Sufficient funds must be available for all \nproposed rehabilitation, acquisition costs, and uses to meet the terms of the \nproposed transaction. Funds must be adequate to address repairs needed \nimmediately,  including all health  and safety,  fair housing and accessibility  issues.  \n \n13. These may  be included as part  of the up-front rehabilitation  that is being paid by \nthird -party  funds. Applicants  must  be able to fund any projected  shortfalls  from \nresources other than the project or project income. \n7.3 KEY  ANALYTICAL  CONCEPTS  \nIn evaluating all the components  of a transfer request, the Loan  Servicer  and the \nApplicant need to determine if the transfer meets RD\u2019s objectives by collecting the \ninformation necessary to form the analytical foundation for Agency processing and authorization of the proposal.  \n \nUsing a preliminary analytical process and the processes provided in this Handbook, \nthe Loan  Servicer  and underwriter should be able to answer,  and document  the proposed terms \nand conditions  that will ultimately  serve  as part of the basis for approving the transfer  request. \nFormal final approval will only be granted upon submission and acceptance of all required documentation in its totality, and the Agency's completion of the internal analytical analysis tools as prescribed.  RD underwriting considers the applicant's capacity to pay the loan, \nprovide sufficient capital to meet the transfer requirements, demonstrate the character necessary to meet operational ownership and management requirements, provide and maintain the project collateral, and meet the anticipated conditions necessary to close the \ntransaction and complete any required construction needs.  \n \nApplicants must have both sufficient experience and the financial capacity for the \ndevelopment and ownership of the proposed property transfer. Applicants are required to \nsubmit appropriate documentation to assist RD underwriters and approval officials evaluate and establish reasonable expectations to assure the terms and conditions of the respective assistance can be followed and carried in meeting the purposes intended. Applicants, \nincluding any affiliated entities sharing an identity of interest with the applicant (i.e., \nmanagement, contractors, etc.), must be in compliance on all or  any other Agency- financed \nprojects that they may own or provide  \ndecision -making and operational authority over. Any \nnoncompliance issues must have been cured  or be in compliance with a workout agreement \napproved by the RD for at least 6 consecutive months  as of the date that the initial application \nis due unless an exception is authorized by HQ.  \n \nNewly  formed applicant  entities,  may not have  the ability  to demonstrate  creditworthiness \nand financial capacity to meet basic program eligibility determinations. RD underwriters and \napproval officials may then look at the individual key principals the applicant identifies with the \norganization, decision making and operational authority controlling the applicant organization or \nentity as necessary.  \n \nAll Principals will be identified and analyzed with respect to their capacity of credit, \nexperience and financial histories. Regulatory standards established in the Code of Federal \nRegulations  (24 C.F.R.) Part 200 Subpart  H Participation  and Compliance  requirements  determine \nthe appropriate review of previous participation in multifamily insured programs based upon their \npast performance as well as other aspects of their records. 42 U.S. Code \u00a7 1441 ",

Eligibility  \nThe Loan  Servicer  must  establish  applicant  eligibility  in the same manner  as during the \nloan origination  process,  including an in depth evaluation of the applicant  and the individual \nprincipals of the applicant entity and any sub- entity.  These requirements set the basic \nstandards for all borrowers including: \n \n1. Analysis  of financial capacity  (such  as balance  sheets for all principals,  including the \nindividual key principals involved in the organization, decision- making  and \noperational authority that may control the applicant and any sub -applicant entities \ninvolved ); \n \n2. Credit worthiness  of all principals  (such  as credit  reports,  contingent  obligations, \npayment history, etc.);  \n3. Experience  (such  as previous  participation  certificates,  CAIVRs,  SAMs,  etc.); \n4. Incidence  of ongoing or chronic  adverse actions in other projects or business \ntransactions;  \n \n5.

When  necessary  to establish \nthe continued  need for a property,  the loan underwriter may require additional \ndocumentation  acceptable to RD that there  is an actual  need for the project  considering \nany other  existing or planned affordable  housing in the market  area. \n \nNote: RD needs and LIHTC needs may not always serve the same market, and may \nhave  different demands  and concerns as affordable  housing. Reviewers must  ensure that RD \nfunds will be used in accordance with the program\u2019s statutory  requirements.  The project\u2019s \neligibility  as documented during the loan transfer  process  requires the loan servicer  to confirm \nthat the project will remain  eligible after the transfer.  \nB. Feasibility  \nThe Loan Servicer must determine if the proposed transfer is feasible.  This \nfeasibility  determination  requires  an in-depth  financial analysis of project operations,  sources \nand uses of funds, and potential for future success.  See Paragraph 7.23. \nC.

There  is a change  in the legal  entity  owning the project,  such that the transferee \nis commonly considered a distinct and separate legal entity from the original \nborrower (including, without limitation, a change resulting in a new Internal Revenue Service Tax ID number), or 100 percent of a borrower entity's \nownership interests will be transferred within a 12 -month period (7 CFR \n3560.405 (a)). \n \nChanges in membership within the ownership entity such as the admission of non-  \ncontrolling  members  do not constitute  a transfer,  but do require  RD involvement  as discussed \nin Chapter 5 of this Handbook. A change in ownership due to the death or involuntary \nincapacitation of a joint owner, beneficiary of a trust owner, or in membership within the \nownership entity such as a general partner interest being sold or bequeathed may not constitute a transfer as long as the incoming member meets RD eligibility requirements, and the State Director requests authorization on a case- by-case basis from RD HQ.  The change \nmust be appropriately documented without any change in the currently authorized RTO for the project; additional debt, liability, or encumbrance of the RD loan security; or change of project type or purpose. RD HQ will review the status of the project's current physical and \noperational condition and may waive any other provision of this chapter for these cases only when the RD approval official determines that such ownership change is in the best interests of the government  and the tenants.  Borrowers  may request  to transfer  their project  to another \nentity in which the members are involved in both the transferring and the assuming entities, provided the new entity be legally organized, discloses all Identity- of-Interest situations, and \nmeets applicable RD eligibility requirements.  (See also Paragraphs 7.5 and 7.16 E.)  \n \nA proposed transfer  to an IRS-approved intermediary  for purposes  of a Section  1031 \nexchange is a transfer for purposes of this chapter.  \n \nIf the transfer  being proposed is part of an Agency incentive  offer as described  in \nChapter  15 of this Handbook as part of a prepayment  incentive  offer,  a complete  transfer \napplication package must be submitted as described herein unless all of the following \nconditions are being met:  \n \n1. No additional sources of funding are being brought into the transaction and the \nnew owner  does  not request  any RTO consideration other  than  those  approved \nas part of the Agency incentive offer;  \n \n2. There are also no existing physical, operational or financial needs, or \ndeficiencies  that must  be addressed  to ensure  the continued success of the \nproject in meeting the MFH program mission; and  ",

Non-Program  Transfers [7 CFR 3560.406 (l)] \nThis chapter  does  not apply to  non- program  transfers,  as discussed  in Chapter  5 of this \nHandbook. However,  such a transfer  or sale will only be considered  when  it is determined  by \nRD to be in the best interest of  the Federal  Government  and the  objectives  of the original  loan \ncan no longer be met.  \nC. Underwriting  \nUnderwriting  as used in this Chapter  refers  to the process of determining  the financial \nand operational  feasibility  of the project, applicant  eligibility,  environmental  compliance,  and \nfair housing compliance of a proposed transaction based on the specific requirements \nspecified in this Chapter, Agency Handbooks and guidance, and/or applicable Notice of \nFunding Availability (NOFA), and/or Notice of Solicitation of Applications (NOSA).  The \nspecific aspects of the transaction process such as determining applicant eligibility, assessing \nenvironmental  compliance,  or evaluating fair housing compliance  are more  fully  addressed  in \nthe current RD Handbooks and Regulations, and supplemented from time to time with other \npublished guidance available on the RD website. \nD. Related  Definitions  \nThe following are definitions  for certain  related  terms used  in this  Chapter. \n \n\u2022 Acceptable Appraisal.  The Agency will use appraisals to determine whether the \nsecurity offered by an applicant or borrower is adequate to secure a loan, or determine appropriate servicing or preservation decisions.  Appraisals used for \nAgency decision- making must be current unless the Agency and the applicant or \nborrower mutually agree to the use of an appraisal that is not current. A current \nappraisal is an appraisal with an effective date that is not more than one year old \nper \n\u00a73560.752. All MFH  appraisals  that were  not written  by an Agency appraiser \nwill be reviewed by an Agency appraiser who will write and file a technical \nreview  report  that complies  with the Uniform Standards  of Professional  Appraisal \nPractice (USPAP) Standard 3, and Agency requirements as prescribed in \nHandbook 1, 3560. \n\u2022  Corporation.

Corporations include \nfor both profit and non -profit entities.  \n\u2022 Debt  Deferral.  A deferral  of an existing RD debt.  Agency debt deferral  is subject \nto appropriations and may be offered to a transfer applicant selected for participation under the terms of an outstanding MPR Program NOSA.  This \ndeferral includes the deferment of the monthly principal and interest payments with a balloon payment at the end of the deferral period. A debt deferral \nagreement will be required for the debts assumed eligible for deferral at the time \nof closing.  \n 7-13 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623 ",

An Exit Incentive is an amount of incentive compensation \ndetermined by RD that may be paid to the selling borrower to facilitate  \ntransferring  the property to an eligible  buyer  when  there  is no equity as determined \nby the RD-accepted  market  value  used in the underwriting  analysis.  See also 7.2 C \n8 for mandatory applicable Guiding Principles.  \n\u2022 Identity -of-Interest.

Third -party funding involves sources of funds other than \nRD funds  and the purchaser\u2019s  personal  funds. The third -party  funding is provided \nby other recognized third- party funding sources as described in 7 CFR 3565.102. \nTax credit equity, HOME funds, and Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funds are a few examples of third -party funding. \n\u2022 \n Transferee.  The transferee is the person or entity  acquiring the RD-financed \nproperty. In this Chapter, the term is used interchangeably with the terms \npurchaser or buyer.  \n\u2022 Transferor.  The transferor is the person or entity selling the RD -financed \nproperty.  In this chapter,  the term is used interchangeably with the terms  borrower \nor seller.  \n7.5 CONDITIONS  FOR  TRANSFERS  \nA. Conditions  When a Transfer May  Occur  \nTransfer  applications,  documenting in writing  one of more  of the following \nconditions, will generally be considered for further processing:  \n\u2022 The transfer  facilitates the physical  and financial  revitalization  of the property;  \n\u2022 The transfer is needed  to remove  a hardship to the current  borrower  that was \ncaused by circumstances beyond the borrower\u2019s control (circumstances constituting \u2018hardship\u2019 are discussed below);  \n\u2022 The transfer  is a result  of a court  order  requiring the division of security  property;  \n\u2022 The transfer  is being requested  as an alternative  to prepayment;  \n\u2022 The transfer  will do no harm  to RD or the current  and future  eligible  tenants;  or \n\u2022 Other  circumstances exist  which  make  the transfer  in the best interest of the \nGovernment. \n \nTypically, RD will not consider  a transfer  if the borrower  has owned the property for \nfewer than five years.  However, if the State Director determines that a hardship is present, \nthe transfer may occur without prejudice to the borrower.  \nExamples  of hardship include, but are not limited  to: \n \u2022 Serious  Illness or death  of the borrower;   \n 7-15 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623 ",
  "page_142": "HB-3-3560  \n  \n\u2022 Serious  financial  difficulties  beyond  a borrower\u2019s  control  that cause the borrower \nto shut down the business operation; or  \n\u2022 Inability  of the borrower  to obtain necessary  credit on terms  that would facilitate \nrefinancing the debt and allow for operation of the project at affordable rents, if \nthe outstanding loans are eligible for prepayment.  \n \nNOTE:  RD will pursue  appropriate  administrative  and/or  civil remedies  with respect \nto transfers that occur without prior RD approval. RD considers these transfers to be \nunauthorized sales. An unauthorized sale also constitutes a default on the RD loan [7 CFR \n3560, subpart J].  \nB. Types  of Transfers  \nThere are many different characteristics and circumstances that may be present in a \ntransfer.  All transfer  applications, unless otherwise specifically exempted in RD Regulations, \nwill comply with the eligibility  requirements based  on the type of project  and the nature  of the \ntransferee for the respective RD MFH program.  These requirements are more fully described \nin the applicable sections of HB 1 -3560. \n \nIf any project being transferred is currently subject to an RD -approved Workout Plan \nand an Identity -of-Interest as defined  by RD regulations, the transferee  must  be in compliance \nwith the workout plan in place and on schedule. In addition, the purchaser (transferee) must \nbe in compliance with RD regulations or have a RD -approved workout plan in place and on \nschedule with respect to any other RD properties owned. \n \nFor a list of documents  to be submitted  when  requesting RD approval  of a transfer,  see \nAttachment 7 -B-1, Transfer Application Documents.  \nC. Coordination  between  RD Headquarters and State  Offices  \nSome transfers raise complex issues and require close coordination between the \nborrower, the purchaser, and the Agency. However, simple transfers can be quickly and \neasily addressed between the borrower, purchaser, and the Agency. For example, a simple \ntransfer of title to a purchaser  with proven capacity,  or transfer of a project  without  regulatory \ncompliance issues that does not require a rent increase or new funding from RD, would \nproceed rapidly from application to approval to closing under the authority of the Loan \nServicer, with a final approval from the State Director as permitted by this Chapter up to the \namounts specified in RD Instruction 1901- A. Compliance issues could include issues with \nthe physical or financial condition of the property, poor management, or noncompliance with \ncivil rights and accessibility laws.  \n \nIn transfers where the State Director\u2019s approval limit is exceeded or requires \nadditional concurrence (e.g. where a rent increase or a policy waiver is necessary) and \nauthorization by RD HQ, the State Director will submit the request together with their recommendation, appropriate documentation and sufficient underwriting documentation as specified  by Agency policy and procedures  to MPDL  prior  to approval. Upon completion of \nthe HQ review, the State Director will be provided with the appropriate concurrence and guidance memorandum authorizing the terms/conditions for the continued final processing, formal approval or denial of the transaction at the State Director level.  \n \n7-16 \n ",

Often underwriting transactions becomes intertwined among \nthe aspects and requirements crossing multiple interdisciplinary divisions within the Rural \nHousing Service (RHS).  To minimize potential confusion for borrowers and applicants, and \nto ensure consistent application of pertinent RHS requirements, underwriters must coordinate \nloan making (direct and guaranteed when applicable) and servicing expectations when \nevaluating the proposed MFH transaction.

Budget/Reasonable  Rents  [7 CFR 3560.406 (d)(2)] \nThe Loan Servicer must review the budget submitted by the transferee to determine \nwhether the budget provides for reasonable rents that the persons eligible for the units in \nquestion can afford. If the transferee is proposing a rent increase, the submission from the \ntransferee should include information on market rents for comparable units in the area, and \ndocumentation that the units  will be marketable at  the proposed higher  rents.  In addition, the \nproposed basic rents for the project upon completion of the transfer must be the lesser of \nCRCU or the restricted rents.  This standard is a benchmark meant to maintain the \naffordability  of program  units  and avoid  increasing  RD Rents  above  local  conventional  rents, \na situation which could lead to non- competitive rents, excessive vacancies, or demand for \nnew or increased rental assistance to remedy any underutilization of units by inappropriate occupancy standards.  \n \nWith  the case- by-case approval  of the RD HQ  the rent standard may be exceeded  in a \ntransfer, but only if the buyer agrees to fund a cash escrow from non- project and non-  \namortizing funding sources such as grants, soft loans, etc. sufficient to cover necessary operating, maintenance,  and reserve  costs at the property being transferred  for the term of the \nRD loan for any amount exceeding the CRCU rents. This might occur in areas experiencing \nan economic decline that has led to rents in conventional properties being set below break-  \neven levels.  While an  increase in RTO or financing equity payout to a seller may sometimes \nbe an appropriate servicing action, neither will be authorized. These are not valid factors to \nconsider in assessing whether property viability creates a need to exceed CRCU.  \n \nThe Loan Servicer should be particularly diligent in analyzing the budget and \nproposed rents when the transferee will also receive a subsequent loan or other third- party \nfinancing, or there are significant repairs or rehabilitation plans.  The Loan Servicer must \nconsider  both the short -term impact of loan payments  the transferee must  make  immediately \nfollowing the transfer, and the long -term feasibility of the budget and rents to allow for a \nsuccessful project.  If there is any deficiency in the budget or rent structure, the transferee \nmust take appropriate corrective action as part of the transfer actions.  \n \nThird -party debt -service increases can be built into the rent only if the new debt is \ndesignated for, and actually  disbursed for, eligible  Section  515 loan purposes  unless  otherwise \nused for necessary eligible purposes as prescribed when using a Section 538 GRRH loan. If \nthe transaction includes a GRRH loan as part of the final underwritten transaction, a portion  \nof the maximum total allowable development fee may be included as part of the GRRH loan provided there is sufficient cash flow at the rents determined appropriate for the specific transaction and which do not exceed the lesser of CRCU or the allowable LIHTC rents in \neffect at the time of transfer approval.  Loan Servicers will ensure the developer fee is \nreasonable, and does not exceed the maximum allowable by their state tax -credit allocating \nagency.  \n \nEligible Section 515 loan purposes include costs that are RD -approved repairs and \nimprovements, and eligible soft costs which include legal, technical, environmental, and \nprofessional  services [7 CFR  3560.53]. For additional  guidance  on eligible  loan purposes, see \nParagraph 12.6 of RD Handbook 3560- 3, Attachment 4 -B of HB- 1-3560, and 7 CFR  \n 7-31 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623 ",

When  no appraisal  is required,  i.e., no new RD funds  are provided, the transfer  is \non same rates and terms, no additional senior debt or subordination is being \nrequested, and there is no change in the currently authorized RTO, and a current \nAMRS has not been provided, one of the following alternative methods may be \nused to establish CRCU rents:  \na. Determinations  by third  parties:  \n\u2022 Paragraph 4.18 of HB -1-3560 discusses a market study to establish the project \nneed which may be conducted by an appraiser, and a market survey by a non-  \nappraiser to establish the market need for the units.  These are two different \ntypes  of analysis used for different purposes. The market study  by an appraiser \nto establish a possible rent for valuation purposes does not establish CRCU rents; however, a market survey by a non- appraiser would be acceptable to \nestablish CRCU rents.  \n\u2022 If the third -party  is an appraiser,  an AMRS  would be appropriate  as discussed \nabove. There is no need to order a market study.  \n\u2022 If the third  party  is not an appraiser,  a market  survey  may be used to establish \nCRCU rents.  \nb. Determinations  by State  Office staff:  \n\u2022 State  office  review  of advertised  rents for  comparable conventional properties.  \n\u2022 State  Office knowledge of rents  being  charged  in the area. \nBasic Rents  used  in RD underwriting  are capped  at 100 percent  of the lesser  of CRCU \nor the restricted  rents  if the proposed transfer includes  any increased  RTO or  an equity payout \nto the seller.  Non-equity compensation cannot have an impact on rents.  \n \nIn other situations when the proposed post -transfer rent increase is solely to support \noperations, including increased annual reserve deposits based on the approved CNA, Basic Rents  may exceed  CRCU,  but may not exceed  150 percent  of CRCU [7 CFR  3560.406(d)(2)]. \nRD HQ prior concurrence is required when Basic Rents exceed CRCU.  \n \nNOTE:  Loan Servicers should note that field office authority is capped at 100 \npercent of CRCU for transfer transactions.  RD HQ Multi -family Preservation and Direct \nLoan  (PDLD)  concurrence  is required  for any situation  in which  CRCU  will be exceeded  for \nany transfer transactions.  \n \nA rent increase may be justified when it is solely to support operations for increased \nO&M  expenses and/or  an increased  reserve deposit. Annual  rent increases should be limited \nto not more than 10% per year. If a larger rent increase is necessary to meet required third party underwriting requirements, the rent increase may be phased in to meet such \nrequirements.  \n \nIf the rent increase includes  debt service on a new loan, Basic Rents  must  be at or \nbelow CRCU.  RD may consider an exception if the rent increase is solely to support \noperations if all of the following are true:  \n \n 7-33 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623 ",

Shortfalls  must  be offset by the transferee from  non-project  sources or funded \nwith additional third -party  debt.  \n \nIn cases in which the existing Basic Rents exceed CRCU, the Loan Servicer must \ndocument to the approval official that the above -CRCU rents were needed solely to meet \noperational  requirements. No increased  RTO or equity pay out was built into the pre-transfer \nrents.  If this documentation cannot be provided, a violation of [7 CFR 3560.406(d) (2)] has \noccurred, and the State Office and PDLD must appropriately service the account to restore \nprogram compliance. This may impact the proposed transfer transaction.  \nC. Increased  Basic  Rents  Because of New Debt  Service  \nIf rehabilitation will be performed, Basic Rents should not increase until after \ncompletion of construction/repairs and RD acceptance. Debt service on new debt  (not \nconstruction permanent , bridge or interim/temporary) resulting from construction, \nimprovements and repairs should not be included in Basic Rents until all eligible costs,  \nfunded with the proceeds  of the new debt, have  been  expended. Interim rent increases may be \nconsidered for payment of that portion of the new permanent debt used to pay acquisition equity only  if not otherwise funded with interim or bridge financing included with interim \nconstruction financing.  \n \nLoan Servicers may begin the rent increase and tenant notification processes prior to \ncompletion of repairs so that Basic Rents can be increased as soon as possible following completion of repairs.  Depending on the nature of the repairs and the length of the tenant \nnotification  period, processing of the rent increase  may need  to begin when  repairs are no less \nthan 50 percent complete so that rents can increase soon after completion of repairs.  \n \nIf debt service is included in the Basic Rents, the proceeds of the loan must be used  \nfor eligible  Section  515 loan purposes  or allowable  Section  538 loan purposes  as underwritten \nfor the transfer.  See [7 CFR 3560.53], Attachment 4- B of HB -1-3560, and 7CFR 3565.205. \n \nOften, new third- party debt is proposed to have a first -lien security position, and \nexisting USDA loans are proposed to be subordinated and be in a second lien position. Subordination will not be allowed  unless all proceeds  of the new debt are for eligible  RD \nuses.  \n7.8 SALES  PRICE  \nA. Limitations  \nThere  is no limitation  on the sales price  that is paid solely  from assumption  of existing \ndebt plus non- RD funds that do not affect Basic Rents, e.g. LIHTC equity, and the \npurchaser\u2019s personal equity.  \nIn all other  situations,  the sales price  should not exceed  the lower  of two limitations: \n1. The first limitation  is the total of: \na. The appraised  present  market value  of the real estate;  and \n ",
  "page_161": "HB-3-3560  \n b. The balance of the Reserve for Replacements account. The balance itself must \npass to  the purchaser, but the  amount  can be included in the sales price when \nthe approved transfer- underwriting  Sources  and Uses includes  other  sufficient \nnon-permanent debt sources of equivalent amounts.  \n \n2. The second limitation is the amount of sales price that can be supported within \nCRCU rents.  For example,  if the cash portion of the sales  price  is paid with third - \nparty debt, the new debt service plus all other costs of operation including \nadequate O&M expenses and an adequate Reserve deposit must be supportable at Basic Rents that do not exceed CRCU.  \nB. Equity  Payout  (General)  \nThe intended purpose  of this section  is to clarify  RD\u2019s  position  as it pertains  to paying \nout equity depending on different loan situations. Generally, an equity payout pertains to transfers in which the seller desires an equity payment and the transfer will avert prepayment of the existing RD loan(s) and removal of needed affordable rental housing units.  \n1. Equity Sources  Not Affecting  Basic  Rents.  \nAs long as the requirements  of 7 CFR 3560.406(e)  are met, RD generally  does \nnot place any restrictions on payments of equity funded with the purchaser\u2019s cash, \ngrants, tax credit equity, or third- party loans that do not depend on rental income for \nrepayment. Such equity payments do not result in any increased RTO or in any \nadjustment to the Basic Rents.  RD will not subordinate its first lien position to any \nsuch third -party  loan.  Owners  who have  previously received incentives  not to prepay \nmay receive additional equity from these sources. \n2. Equity Funded With  RD Debt  Repaid  Through Rents.  \nCurrent  RD policy is to fund equity payout  with  RD loans  only in  prepayment \nsituations.  These situations are not addressed in this Chapter.  See Chapter 15 of HB \n3-3560.  \n3. Equity Funded With  Third -Party Debt  Repaid  Through Rents.  \nEquity can be funded  from a third -party  loan including a Section  538 \nguaranteed loan that is repaid from rental income only if:  \n \na. The equity amount is limited to the lesser of an amount documented in an \nappraisal acceptable to Rural Development (See HB -1-3560, Chapter 7 and \nAttachment 7 -C of HB- 1-3560), or an amount supportable at rents within \nCRCU,  after allowing  for adequate  O&M  expenses  and an adequate  Reserve in \naccordance with this chapter.  \n \nb.

Buyer/seller/cash  flow notes.  \nIf full payment is not made in cash to the seller at closing, no rental income \nmay be used to pay any of the remaining  amount  of the purchase price,  no lien may be \nplaced on the project assets or income, and there must be no provisions that provide the note holder with any present or future interest or claim in the property, income, or \nassets of the property being sold or relinquished. 7 CFR 3560.406(c)(5) further provides  that there  must  not be any provision that allows  the property to revert  back  to \nthe original owner for any reason during the term that any RD loan remains outstanding.  These types of transactions are frequently referred to as buyer, seller, \ncash flow or carryback notes and do not meet RD requirements for recognized debt \ntypes.

The Agency will require  that all or part of an \nequity payment  be applied  against  other  Agency loans  owed  by the borrower  if \npayments on the other loans are not current.  \n \nb.

This guarantee, which may take the form of a cash escrow, bond, \nenforceable letter of credit or other valid form of surety acceptable to RD, will be provided by either the seller or purchaser to assure timely completion of the repair.  \n7.

Non-Equity  Compensation  Payments  \nWhen there is no equity in the project, the transferee may choose to pay additional \ncompensation as part of the negotiations  with the transferor to reach  a mutual  agreement  for \nthe transfer.  This situation is most appropriate when the buyer determines that the transfer \nwill be in their best interests if they were to offer assistance to remove an existing RD \nborrower with compliance or performance problems, and RD concurs that non- equity \ncompensation is less expensive than liquidating the property.  \n \nThe State  Director must  request  RD HQ to authorize  the transaction.  No RD loan \nfunds may be used to pay the non- equity compensation. See Paragraph 7.29 F. \n \nThe proposed non- equity compensation must be applied first to satisfy any non-  \nUSDA claims,  e.g. third -party  loans,  before  any amounts  may be paid to the seller/transferor.  \n7.9 RETURN- TO-OWNER  (RTO)  \nA. RTO  in General  \nThe transferee\u2019s initial investment and RTO, will be determined by RD analytical \nanalysis  at the time of transfer  approval.  The new owner's  RTO  will be computed based  on \nthe provisions of the Agency\u2019s current transfer guidance and principles.  \n \nThe maximum potential RTO for RD MFH transfers is based on the net cash flow \nfrom project operations, as determined by use of the RD analytical tool, PAT. The RTO \ncalculation  considers  the amount  of tax credit  equity  [as defined in 7 CFR 3560.406(d)]  that is \nused for the RD RRH  eligible  hard costs  of construction purposes  (defined in 7 CFR 3560.68) \nand any additional owner contribution for hard construction costs in establishing the maximum RTO the specific project will support.  The maximum potential RTO the buyer  \nmay be eligible to earn annually throughout the term of the loan is determined by RD at the \ntime of transfer approval.  This maximum RTO is computed through an analysis of the \nRehabilitation total hard costs eligible under the RD Section 515 Program less all new Loans \nthat do not exceed the RD as improved Security Value determined at the time of loan \napproval.  \n \nThe new RTO may not exceed the amount remaining from the projected Net \nOperating Income (NOI) less debt service for all loans without agency debt deferral as determined in the final RD underwriting used for the transfer approval. NOI for payment of \nRTO will be based on the project budget post -rehabilitation, using rents not exceeding the \nlessor  of CRCU or LIHTC or other  restricted  program  rents,  and after deducting all operating, \nreserve, vacancy, and other cushions and approved project operating costs.  \n \nIf the transfer  is from  a non-profit  to a limited -profit  borrower, the initial investment \nto be shown in the loan agreement or resolution will be \u201cNone\u201d unless the transferee contributes additional equity.  \n \nRTO as established  for the transfer  closing will remain  unchanged throughout  the term \nof the RD loan(s) included, assumed, or modified at the time of transfer closing unless modified at a future date by RD as part of an approved servicing action.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n7-38 ",

The actual  calculation  is carried  out in the RD analytical  template  (PAT) \nrequired by RD HQ. Note that this RTO calculation for transfers differs from the RTO \ncalculations for prepayment transactions and the ROI calculations used in the project's initial/original development.  \n \nIf the new RTO approved for the transfer decreases, it will be effective immediately \nupon closing  and accrue  to the new owner.

The \naddendum should include language such as the following:  \n \nA maximum  potential  earned  annual  authorized  Return  to Owner  (RTO)  in the amount \nof $ (  ) has been  determined  allowable  by RD based on the Agency's analytical \nanalysis used in authorizing the transfer to the borrower named herein.

Any increase in RTO may only be earned starting the beginning of the first project fiscal year following the \ncompletion and RD approval of the agreed- upon rehabilitation. \nThe addendum  must  be submitted  to the Regional  OGC for review  of any state law \nissues.  \nThe maximum new RTO  is the amount  supportable  within  NOI set forth  in Paragraph  \n7.2 D 2 for the property using the post -rehab operating budget expenses, reserves and debt \nservice used in the transfer underwriting analysis and documented in the PAT at the time of transfer approval.

Developer Fees in General  \nIn accordance with  \u00a73560.54(a)  (9), payment  of a developer's  fee is  not an eligible  use \nof RD loan funds  unless  they are being used in conjunction with a Section  538 GRRH loan in \nthe transaction. The fees may  be included in the total development  costs if  they are paid from \nother sources when analyzing the Federal Government assistance to the project.  \n\u2022 The Agency may recognize a developer's fee paid from other sources on \nconstruction  or rehabilitation  of up to 15 percent  of the total development  costs \nauthorized for LIHTC purposes, or by another Federal Government program.  \n\u2022  For transfer  proposals  that include  acquisition costs,  the developer's  fee on \nthe acquisition cost may be recognized up to  eight (8) percent of the acquisition \ncosts only when authorized under a Federal Government program providing \nassistance.  \n \nThe developer's  fee is not included in determining  the Agency's  maximum debt limit \nand loan amount. Debt service on new debt may not be included in Basic Rents unless all \nproceeds are used for eligible Section 515 loan purposes. See acceptable uses at 7 CFR \n3560.53, and 7 CFR 3565.205, if applicable.  \n \nRD recognizes,  however,  that some  non-RD funders  may allow  developer/builder  fees \nthat are reasonable in their specifically defined and designated circumstances but such fees are not eligible for payment from any project revenues or sources.  There is an exception for \nSection 538 loans, which can include a developer fee, however the maximum RD allowable rents  may not be sufficient  to support  the amount  of Section  538 debt and will require  either a \nreduction or deferral of all or part of this fee.  \nB. Deferred Developer Fee  \nIn LIHTC transactions with third -party funding, the maximum developer fee \nallowable may exceed the amount that can be paid in cash from the transfer transaction\u2019s sources of funds. The amount of the unpaid developer fee is referred to as a deferred \ndeveloper  fee. Sponsors  expect  to collect  their deferred  developer  fee from cash flow derived \nfrom the future successful operation of the property.  The deferred developer fee may not be \npaid from operations.  They may be paid from authorized RTO that is earned by the project \nand paid to the borrower.  \n \nRD does  not permit borrowers  to treat the  deferred  developer  fee as a  loan or to make \npayments toward the deferred developer fee from the operating account.

Relationship  between  Basic  Rents  and LIHTC Rents  - \nGeneral (Paragraph 7.4 F of HB -2-3560)  \n \nThis section  applies  during the term in which  the LIHTC  rents  are in effect,  generally \n15 to 30 years but may be longer for some properties and in some states.  \n \nLIHTC rent limitations require that the owner charge tenants no more than the \nmaximum  LIHTC  rents.  Therefore,  LIHTC  maximum  rents  may differ from  the Basic Rents \nthat are established  in accordance with RD requirements.  It is also possible  that there  will be \ndifferent LIHTC rents for the same unit type due to differing LIHTC affordability \nrequirements.  See Paragraph 7.11 C. of this Handbook for a discussion of Tax Credit Rents. \n \nThe following is a summary  of the relevant  provisions  of Chapter  7 of HB-2-3560, \nprovided here for convenience, and does not modify or supersede HB -2-3560:  \n \n1. Basic Rents continue to be set by RD at the level necessary to provide for the \nphysical  and financial  viability  of the project.  Basic  Rents  may be higher  or lower \nthan the maximum LIHTC rents.  \n2. If Basic Rents are higher  than the  maximum  LIHTC  rents,  then:  \n\u2022 The tenant  portion  of rent may not  exceed  the maximum  LIHTC rent.  \n\u2022 For tenants receiving RA and for tenants receiving Section 8 vouchers, the \nborrower  may collect  the full amount  of RA or Section  8 voucher  amounts  not \ngreater  than Basic Rent  without  violating LIHTC  requirements.  \n\u2022  When  RA is not available,  the borrower  is responsible  for any shortfalls  in \nrevenue including all overage. See 7 CFR 3560.202(g).  \n3. If Basic Rents  are equal  to or lower  than the maximum LIHTC rents, then:  \n\u2022 The tenant  portion  will be based  on 30 percent  of the adjusted monthly income.  \n\u2022 If 30 percent of  the tenant\u2019s adjusted  monthly income is  above  Basic Rent:  \n\uf0a7 If the project was allocated LIHTCs after 1990, the borrower may charge \ntenants  the appropriate  overage  due without  regard  to the maximum LIHTC \nrent. [Internal Revenue Code \u00a742(g)(2)(B)(iv)]  \n\uf0a7 If the project was allocated LIHTCs in 1990 or earlier, the borrower may \nnot charge  tenants  more  than the maximum  LIHTC  rent, and the borrower  is \nresponsible for any shortfall in overage that the borrower must pay to RD \nfrom non-project  funds. See Paragraph 7.4, Exhibit  7-3, Example  2 of HB- \n2-3560.)  \n\uf0a7 The determining factor is the allocation year for the LIHTCs.

Financial  Viability  When Basic  Rents  Exceed  Maximum  LIHTC Rents  \nIf the proposed transfer involves a revenue shortfall because Basic Rents exceed \nmaximum authorized Tax Credit Rents and the estimated shortfall is less than the post - \ntransfer RTO,  the borrower  will receive less than the full RTO.  Each  Form  RD 3560- 7 must \nshow a positive cash flow on Line 30, and will show a level of RTO that is less than the \nmaximum allowable RTO.  \n \nHowever, if the estimated shortfall is more than the new post -transfer RTO, the \nproposed transfer is not viable unless the borrower proposes a funding mechanism together with reducing the RTO to zero that is sufficient to cover the likely revenue shortfalls.  An \nexample  of an adequate  funding mechanism  is an operating deficit reserve,  funded from non- \nUSDA funds that is adequate to cover projected revenue shortfalls over the LIHTC compliance period. A borrower\u2019s promise to pay future shortfalls over and above reducing \nRTO to zero is not an adequate funding mechanism, unless the promise is backed by a \nguarantee from a creditworthy entity. \n \nRD HQ will provide  technical  assistance to State  Offices  on a case- by-case basis in \nimplementing Tax Credit Rents.  \n7.12 OTHER POLICY CONSIDERATIONS  \nA. Principal  and Interest  during  Construction  \nIf the transfer  includes  new financing,  any payments  toward  the new financing during \nconstruction must be paid from third -party funds and may not be paid from the operating \naccount. The Sources and Uses of Funds statement should include a category entitled \nConstruction Loan Interest or Construction Period Interest, and should show funds sufficient to pay any construction -period interest and/or principal on third- party debt. \n \nPrincipal and interest on the pre-existing  USDA loan(s)  will continue  to be an \nauthorized payment from the operating account during the construction period.  \n \nLoan  Servicers  should expect  that, typically, construction  loan interest will be built \ninto the construction loan amount.

Loan Servicers should coordinate with other government funders so that the \nobjectives of all of the funding agencies are achieved.  When all the \ngovernment funders speak with a united voice, it is more likely that the \nappropriate  public  purpose  objectives  will be achieved.  The Loan  Servicer \nshould contact the other government funders to determine their objectives, \nconcerns, and constraints, and to share USDA\u2019s objectives, concerns, and \nconstraints.  \nb.

The Loan Servicer may obtain OGC \nconcurrence  as needed  to make  such a determination.  If there  are any deficiencies,  the Loan \nServicer should follow the procedure in Paragraph 7.6 C. \nD. Additional Requirements for Existing  Borrowers \nIf the transferee is an existing borrower with existing or past RD loans, and is \nacquiring title under the same name, refer to [7 CFR 3560.55(b)] and Section 3: 4.16, Paragraph  D of HB-1-3560, for a detailed  discussion on further eligibility  requirements  for \ncurrent  or previous  borrowers.  (Existing  borrowers  currently  have  one or more  outstanding \nloans with RD and the ownership name will remain the same.) For existing borrowers and key principles the transferee must:  \n\u2022 Be in compliance  with all program  requirements  or have  been  in compliance with \nan approved workout agreement for a minimum of six months for all other projects owned by members of the assuming entity;  \n\u2022 Have documented evidence that the conditions that resulted in any workout agreement  were  beyond the borrower\u2019s  control  and were  not due to inappropriate \nactions by the borrower; and \n\u2022 Have no outstanding adverse audit or investigation findings issued by the OIG. Any OIG audit  or investigation must  be closed  or disposed of to the satisfaction  of \nOIG.

Insurance  \nAll RD properties are required to be able to obtain and maintain insurance as require \nby program regulations. Applicants incapable of providing evidence of insurability prior to \nclosing, are not eligible  and will be processed  under  Paragraph 7.6 C. Completion  of this step \nensures that RD\u2019s security properties will be protected from all damage and loss following \ntransfers.  \nG. Site Control  \nThe transferee\u2019s documentation must show enforceable control of the property as \ndescribed  in Paragraph  7.6 A 2. As explained under  [7 CFR 3560.61(d)],  the transferee must \nown the land when the transfer is closed, or have an RD approved leasehold interest in land. \nMost commonly in transfer situations, site control will be in the form of an option -to- \npurchase from the borrower or in the form of a purchase contract.  If the purchaser does not \nyet have site control, i.e., the right to purchase the project without further consents from the seller, the Loan Servicer should decline the transfer request and return the application to the purchaser.  \nH. Eligible  Transferee  \nAttachment 7 -A, Revitalization Guidance, states that when the transaction is \ncomplete,  the property will be in the hands  of eligible  owners.

If there are questions, however, the Loan Servicer should refer to Chapter 6 \nof this Handbook to determine if additional analysis is required to verify that there is still a \nneed for the project and the project is not obsolete. Any additional analysis should be \nprioritized in order to meet the timeframes for processing the transfer request.  \n \nPrior to entering  into a transfer  or other  revitalization  process,  RD must  be satisfied \nthat favorable patterns in housing and population statistics indicate the property will be needed to provide affordable rental housing to eligible tenants in the community.  \n\u2022 The determination  of need  will be documented in the case file.

However,  the \nLoan Servicer should take the necessary steps to ensure that the project remains an eligible \nproperty. Typically, the purchaser\u2019s written statements (See Attachment 7 -B-1, Transfer \nApplication Documents) and the project\u2019s operational and financial history will provide the \nprimary foundation for determining that the project will continue to be eligible.  \n \nThe following addresses  the various  aspects  of the project  eligibility  that are required \nin Paragraph 4.17 of HB -1-3560 and that were reviewed when the project was originally \ndeveloped. In processing the transfer request the Loan Servicer should consider all of the \nfollowing.  \nA. Civil Rights  Impact  Analysis  \nThis requirement is satisfied  through  the civil rights  review  discussed  in Paragraph  \n7.21. In addition, the State  Civil Rights  Coordinator  is invited  to participate  in the site \ninspection. See Paragraph 7.22 B. \nB.

Design  Review  \nIf required by local building codes or enforcement agencies, or due to the scope and \nnature of the planned rehabilitation, the applicant, loan servicer and underwriter should \nconsult RD Instruction 1924- A, any outstanding CNA guidance, and the respective program \nrequirements for rehabilitation  and repair  designs  that may require  professional  and technical \nassistance.  \n \nApplicants  also intending  to participate  in the LIHTC  program  should  discuss  any \nadditional design reviews that may be required to receive tax credits with the RD staff to coordinate development plans. See also Chapter 7.21 to determine if additional design \nreview is needed to ensure full compliance with requirements.  \nE. Prohibited Conditions  \nAn example of prohibited conditions for a transfer is high vacancy in the area. This \nrequirement is not applicable as an eligibility factor unless additional RD funding is  \nproposed, in which case the Loan Servicer will consider Prohibited Conditions in connection \nwith the new funding. See Paragraph 4.17 of HB -1-3560. High vacancy in the area would, \nof course, be a significant factor affecting project feasibility.  Any other affordable housing \nprojects  in the market area also need  to be evaluated  to determine  if there  is a continuing need \nfor the property being transferred.  \nF.

The cost of such repairs and rehabilitation will be shown in the Sources and Uses in the PAT. The as-  \nimproved CNA/Reserve Analysis section of the PAT, will reflect only those capital items not initially fully cured in the RD approved Scope of Work and will be required to repaired or replaced within the 20 -year analysis period of the PAT  \nA.

Incomplete CNAs will be returned and the \napplication  may be rejected  upon the applicant\u2019s  failure  to supply this information  for any \napplication over eight units.  \n \nFor transactions that do not include third- party fully funded rehabilitation, the CNA \nscope of work requires the CNA provider to assess and evaluate the current \u2018as -is\u2019 physical \ncondition of the property and, using the Estimated  Useful  Life table  that is included as part of \nthe Statement of Work, develop a 20-year Replacement  Reserve schedule showing the timing \nand costs for the maintenance, repair, and replacement of all capital items at the property.  \n \nFor transactions that include third- party funded rehabilitation, e.g., transactions \ninvolving the acquisition of tax credits, the scope of work requires the CNA  provider to use \nthe proposed  and RD -approved third -party  funded rehabilitation  scope,  and develop  a 20-year \nReplacement  Reserve schedule  that assumes that the third -party  funded rehabilitation  will \noccur as planned. Because the rehabilitation  will not be funded from  the reserve,  RD does not \nrequire  the CNA to include  the rehabilitation,  and does not require  the CNA provider  to review \nthe rehabilitation costs or scope.  \n \nTypically, the draft CNA is subsequently revised based on input from RD, the \npurchaser, and/or other funders to project the \u201cPost Rehab\u201d CNA indicating what repairs are \nplanned for the property in the coming  20 years based  on conditions  after the rehabilitation  is \n ",

For transfer analysis, the underwriting tool (PAT) \nconsiders the ongoing future operations by assuming that Basic Rents rise no faster than \ninflation to be consistent with typical third -party lending principles that the property should \nbe viable  for at least the 20-year CNA analysis period  provided  it also complies  with required \nRD servicing  regulations. This analysis assumes the new owner  will comply  with the ongoing \nterms and conditions over the term of the RD direct loan program servicing requirements.  \nA. Analytical  Template  \nIn order to evaluate feasibility, the Loan Servicer will complete an analytical template \n(PAT)  in the format prescribed  by PDLD,  and found on SharePoint. The template  is designed \nto support decision- making regarding feasibility, and to serve as a record of feasibility \ndecisions in processing the transfer.  \nB.

Repair  Related  Issues  \nThe Loan  Servicer will ensure  that the CNA complies  with the statement  of work, that \nit accurately reflects the property\u2019s physical needs, and that the transfer is otherwise acceptable to RD.  \n\u2022 If the transferee  is planning to make  substantial  repairs  or undertake  rehabilitation \nof the property, the Loan Servicer will consider whether the transferee\u2019s initial \nplans seem reasonable and that the estimated repair costs seem reasonable.  \n\u2022 If the transferee is proposing significant up -front rehabilitation, that there are \nadequate  provisions  for supervising the work, inspecting  the work, and controlling \nthe repair funds.  \n\u2022 The Loan  Servicer will ensure  there  are sufficient sources  of funds  to carry  out \nrepairs and to pay other costs of the proposed transaction.  \nD.

Tenant  Impact  \nIf the proposed transfer is likely to result in the physical displacement of tenants, e.g., \nbecause of  planned rehabilitation  work, the  Loan  Servicer  will consider  whether  the proposed \ntransfer includes an adequate tenant relocation plan. \n \nIf it is likely  that the proposed rent increase will result in the economic displacement \nof tenants, unless adequate protections are in place, the Loan Servicer will consider whether \nthe proposed transfer includes  adequate protections  for tenants  and the  terms,  conditions  and \nfunding source for such protections.  \nF. Rents  and the Proposed  Operating  Budget  \nThe Loan  Servicer will consider  the following to determine  if the rents  and proposed \noperating budget are sufficient for the operation of the housing as follows:  \n\u2022 Whether  the CRCU rents  are sufficient; see Paragraph  7.7 B; \n\u2022  Whether the proposed transfer requires a rent increase; if so, determine \nwhether  the proposed rents  will be at or below  the lesser  of CRCU or restricted \nrents;  \n\u2022  Whether  the proposed O&M  expenses  are sufficient  to support  the property\u2019s \nlong- term viability;  \n\u2022  Whether  the proposed budget  meets  the minimum  combined  cushion and \nvacancy loss, see Paragraph 7.2 D 2;  \n\u2022  Whether  the NOI is sufficient  to meet  the industry standard debt service  coverage \nratio (DSCR); see Paragraph 7.2 C 13 or 7.2 D 2;  \n\u2022  Whether the level of rent loss. i.e., vacancy plus bad debt, is  reasonable in \nrelation  to the property\u2019s  historical performance  and local  market  conditions;  see \nParagraph 7.2 D 3;  \n\u2022  Whether  the proposed operating budget  includes  an adequate  operating margin \nequal to 20 percent of the total operating expense as underwritten (See Paragraph 7.2 D 5)  so that the property  can absorb  reasonable,  foreseeable fluctuations  in \nrevenues  and expenses without  risking  deferred  maintenance,  default  on RD loans, \nor other financial stresses;  \n ",

Sales  Price/Equity  Payout  \nIf the transfer  calls for equity  distributions  to the existing  owner:  \n\u2022 The appraisal  report  should meet  RD requirements  for determining \nequity;  \n\u2022  The proposed equity payout  should comply with RD requirements; \nand \n\u2022  The proposed transfer includes  adequate provisions  to ensure  that the \nseller has met all applicable requirements before equity is paid.  \nH. RD Loans  \nNormally a transfer will involve assumption of the entire balance of the borrower\u2019s \nexisting loan. If, however, there is insufficient Security Value that will result in a shortfall, \nthe Loan Servicer should determine the borrower\u2019s intentions to address any outstanding balance,  and whether  a write -down may be required as part of the transfer.  See Chapter  11 of \nthis Handbook for more information on write -downs. \nAfter the transfer,  the Loan  Servicer  should confirm: \n\u2022 All RD loans  will be current;  \n\u2022 The taxes and insurance  account  will be adequately funded, with all \noutstanding bills paid; and  \n\u2022 The security  deposit  account  will be fully  funded.  \nIf the transferee is requesting a subsequent loan, the proposed amount of the \nsubsequent  loan should be reasonable  and sufficient,  based  on the information  and supporting \ndocumentation reviewed by the Loan Servicer. If any RD requirements are not likely to be \nmet, the Loan  Servicer  and Underwriter,  through negotiations  with the applicant,  should enter \ninto a credible plan to cure all of the most serious deficiencies within 12 months and the remainder within the first 3 years using funds provided by the applicant unless the general operating account is adequately funded thru planned project operations under a detailed \nworkout  plan, or the application  should be rejected  and provide  the applicant  with appropriate \nappeal rights.

New Terms or Same  Loan  Terms [7 CFR 3560.406 (j)] \nLoan Servicers will review the account to determine which type of transfer needs to \noccur. RD generally completes transfers on new rates and terms to extend the amortization \nperiod thereby reducing the amount of debt service needing to be included in tenant rents. \nRD may allow transfers at same rates and terms even if the transfer does not involve an \nincrease in rents.  In order for this latter type of transfer to take place, it is incumbent upon \nthe borrower  to demonstrate  how a transfer  under  same rates and terms  is in the best interest \nof the Government. For example, if the new owner under a transfer has applied for tax \ncredits, and to qualify for 9 percent credits it is necessary to retain same rates and terms, a \nsame- rates -and-terms transfer may be justified on a case -by-case basis by RD HQ.  \n \nBefore making a recommendation on the transfer, the Loan Servicer should determine \nif the transfer will be  on new terms  or the same terms,  and address any issues or obstacles that \nthis may present.  \nB. Existing  Loans/New Terms - Amortization  Period  and Loan  Term  \nNew rates and terms transfers require that the remaining term of the loan, i.e., the \nmaturity date, does not extend past the lesser of (a) 30 years from the date of transfer; or (b) the remaining useful life of the property.  The loan may be re -amortized over a period not to \nexceed  50 years or the remaining  economic  life of the property  as determined  by the appraisal \nreport of the property, whichever is less.  \n \nThe Loan Servicer typically will determine the remaining economic life of the \nhousing based  on the appraisal.  However,  the Loan  Servicer  may consider  other  information, \nincluding knowledge and experience of RD staff.  If the remaining economic life as \ndetermined in the appraisal is not used, the Loan Servicer must document in the file why a different economic life was selected.  \nC. Existing  Loans/New Terms - Interest  Rate  \nTransfers  on new terms  are subject  to the interest  rate conditions  described  below. If \nrents are increased due to the transfer, the transfer will be done under new  rates and terms if \nRD determines that this is in the best interest of the Government.  \n\u2022  The interest  rate charged for all loans,  except  Labor  Housing loans, will be \nthe current rate being charged for those loans at the time of loan closing or the \ninterest rate at the time of loan approval, whichever is lower.  \n\u2022  The interest rate on Labor  Housing loans  will be the rate specified  in the note, \ngenerally 1 percent, except those on farm loans at the exception rate when credit \nelsewhere is available.  \n \n \n \n \n ",

Closing  Out An Existing  Loan  That Will Not Be Assumed  In Full \nTypical transfers will result in the seller assuming the entire balance of the existing \nloan(s).  If, however, there is insufficient Security Value and the existing loan balance will \nnot be assumed in full, the Loan Servicer and the existing borrower must agree on the debt \nsettlement of the existing loan.  This is particularly important if the transfer will result in a \nloan shortfall  or the borrower  is requesting  an equity  payment  because no equity will be paid. \n \nThe remainder of this paragraph discusses considerations that the Loan Servicer \nshould take into account  when  the full balance of the existing  loan will not be assumed  by the \npurchaser.  \n \nThe Loan Servicer should ensure that the agreed -upon resolution of a shortfall \nmaximizes  the borrower\u2019s  repayment  ability,  and avoids  or minimizes  loss to the Government \nunless it is in RD\u2019s best interest to accept an option that is less than the lowest -cost option.  \nThe Loan  Servicer  should ensure  that the necessary  actions to  resolve  any issues with  the \nexisting borrower  are completed,  or sufficiently  complete  to allow  for the approval  of the \ntransfer.  The Loan Servicer should:  \n\u2022 Determine if the transfer will result in a shortfall on the existing loan.  If a \nwrite -down is needed, see Chapter  11 of this Handbook for more  information;  \n\u2022 Initiate  the debt settlement process,  in accordance with Chapter  12 of this \nHandbook, if  appropriate; and  \n\u2022 Determine  if RD should pursue  legal  remedies against  the borrower.  \nIf there  is insufficient Security  Value  to support  the existing RD debt, the seller will \nnot have equity in the property. If the seller does have equity that is supported by an \nappraisal  meeting  RD requirements  and equity payout  is proposed, consultation with PDLD \nwould be appropriate. If the seller does not have equity, and non- equity compensation is \nproposed, see Paragraphs 7.8 D and 7.29 F. \n7.25 SUBSEQUENT RD LOANS  [7 CFR  3560.406 (h) and (i)] \nRD may provide a subsequent loan or approve one from a third- party source in \nconjunction with an ownership transfer  or sale of a housing project.  An RD subsequent  loan \nmay be:  \n\u2022 a parity  loan;  sharing the first lien position  with the existing RD loan;  \n\u2022 a junior  loan;  junior  to an existing  non-RD loan and sharing the second  lien \nposition with the existing RD loan; or  \n\u2022 a soft second from  a non -RD third -party.  \nA third -party subsequent loan may have the first lien position, with the existing RD \nloans  accepting  second  lien position if the loan(s) are sufficiently  secured.  RD will execute \nits standard Subordination Agreement. \n \nIn any case, the Government must be in a secure position. If the transferee is \nrequesting or receiving a subsequent RD loan, the Loan Servicer should refer to Chapter 10 \nof HB-1-3560 to ensure  that the transferee\u2019s application is complete  and being processed.  The \nLoan Servicer should verify:  \n ",

Soft second and deferred loans are not included in \nthis determination.  \n \nThe proposed debt, including existing debt being assumed and any additional debt, \nshall  be counted for determining  the Security  Value  limitations  set out in [7 CFR 3560.63]. \nThird -party soft second mortgages secured only by proceeds from a future sale of the \nproperty may be excluded from the debt ceiling and Security Value calculations.  \n \nIn all cases,  Agency- approved appraisals will be required when  new debt is added or \nwhen the transfer will be approved and closed with new rates and terms. The amount of \nindebtedness to be assumed will be based on an appraisal that complies with the Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practices (USPAP).  In no instances may appraisals be \ninflated  to defer  loan losses and write - offs, to avoid  adverse tax consequences,  or to support \na higher tax credit basis.  \n7.27 ASSESS  THE  OVERALL RISK  AND IMPACT  ON RD AND TENANTS  \nThe Loan Servicer compiles the evaluation of the eligibility, transferee, and the \nproperty and decides whether  to recommend  the transfer.  Regardless of the level  of detail  the \nLoan Servicer went into in evaluating the transfer, the questions and process that the Loan Servicer must follow remain the same.  \n \nBased on the transferee\u2019s application and the Loan Servicer\u2019s knowledge of the \nexisting borrower  and property condition, the Loan  Servicer  should ask three  questions  as \ndiscussed in the following. \n \nA. Is the Potential for Financial  Loss  to RD Better or No Worse  Than  With \nthe Existing Borrower?  \n \nFor both the seller and purchaser, the Loan Servicer should consider financial \nstrength, managerial strength, and prior experience. The Loan Servicer should examine the \nsecurity  for any increase  in per unit debt for RD funding. The Loan  Servicer  should consider \nwhether any proposed third- party funds are fully committed; if not, the transfer approval \nshould be contingent upon receipt of a binding commitment for the third -party funds.  \n \nB. Will Any Financial  Impact  on Current  and Future  Tenants  be Reasonable?  \n \nThe Loan  Servicer  should consider  any significant  change  in property  rents  in relation \nto tenant incomes.  If post- transfer rents approach or exceed CRCU and not all units are \n \n \n ",
  "page_195": "HB-3-3560 \n7-69  \n covered  by RA or Section  8, the Loan  Servicer  should consider  whether  the non-assisted  units \nwill be marketable at the proposed rents.  \n \nFor current unsubsidized tenants, RD may require the tenant protections described \nbelow  as a condition of approval, in order  to determine  that the transfer  is in the best interests \nof residents and the Federal Government pursuant to [7 CFR 3560.406(b)].  \n \na.  In these  situations,  RD may require  that post-transfer rents  for unsubsidized \ntenants  be subsidized  by the owner  foregoing any authorized RTO,  to the extent \nnecessary  to reduce  the rental  payment  to the pre-transfer rent, or 30 percent  of \nadjusted income, if higher.  \n \nb. If RD requires the above condition be met, the  applicant/transferee  will only be \nrequired to subsidize the difference in rents  that exists at the time of the transfer \nclosing for any unsubsidized tenant  that is negatively  impacted  by the post-transfer \nrents.  For example, if at the time of  the transfer, the 2BR rent increased  by $75, \none unsubsidized tenant was  negatively impacted, and that tenant occupied a 2BR \nunit at the time of the  transfer, the subsidy to be provided by the applicant to the \naffected tenant  remains  at $75 per month without regard to subsequent changes to \nthe Basic Rents.  \n \nc.  Annual  operating budgets  are to reflect  the amount  of foregone  RTO to fund the \ntemporary rent protections.  The obligation with respect to each unsubsidized \ntenant in place at the time of the transfer will end  when the tenant:  \n\u2022 Receives rental  assistance;  \n\u2022 Receives a housing voucher;  \n\u2022 Voluntarily  leaves the property;  \n\u2022 Is evicted  for proper  cause;  or \n\u2022 Has income increased to pay the post -transfer Basic Rent without being rent \nover-burdened. If, for example, the pre -transfer rent is $250, at each \nrecertification the unsubsidized tenant will pay the greater of $250 or 30 \npercent  of adjusted income,  until the tenant  can pay the full post-transfer  Basic \nRent.  \n \nd.  The following is loan agreement  language  that may be used as an addendum  to \ndocument this requirement:  \n \nAs of [date], [number]  income -producing units  were unsubsidized units, of \nwhich [number] were occupied by the following Affected Tenants:  \n \n[Unit number, unit type, tenant name, pre -transfer Basic Rent, post -transfer \nBasic Rent].  Notwithstanding the authorized Return to Owner (RTO) level \ndiscussed in paragraph [x], the owner is responsible for any shortfall in overage  that the borrower  must  pay to RD from  non-project  funds  to subsidize \nthe rents of all affected  tenants. The subsidy for each unit is the difference \nbetween  the pre-transfer  Basic  Rent and the  post-transfer  Basic  Rent;  that is, \nthe rent to be paid by each  affected  tenant  will be the then current  Basic  Rent \nminus the subsidy.

Specifically, these requirements ensure that:  \n\u2022 All accounts,  property, and subsidy as applicable,  with advice  from regional  OGC \nare properly assigned to the transferee;  \n\u2022 A proper  loan agreement  or loan resolution for the type of transferee  is in effect  and \nsecured  in the mortgage or deed of trust (typically  a same rates and terms transfer \ndoes not  require a new mortgage or deed of trust unless required by the Regional \nOGC);  \n\u2022 The transferor is released  from liability  when  all RD security  is transferred  and \nthe total outstanding debt is assumed; and  \n\u2022 Applicable restrictive- use provisions are required for the transferred loans. \nExhibit  7-3, Basic Steps  in Implementing  Transfers,  summarizes the steps Loan  \nServicers  and Underwriters  should take to implement approved transfers and may the order \nmay be adjusted to meet the specific timelines necessary to successfully complete the \ntransaction.

Determine  the Loan  Balance  \nTo determine the current loan balance for transfer, the Loan Servicer must execute \nForm  RD 3560- 21 according to the FMI.  The unpaid principal balance  and accrued  interest \nto be shown on Form  RD 3560- 21 is determined  by accessing  the project  account  record  via \nfield terminal.  The Loan  Servicer  should contact  NFAOC to verify  the correct  amounts  and \ndates to be used in closing the transaction. The Loan Servicer will advise the transferee of:  \n\u2022  The total amount  paid as of the closing  date that has not been  credited  to the \naccount;  \n\u2022  The payment  required  to place the account  on schedule  as of the previous \ninstallment due date;  \n\u2022 Payment  required  to bring  any monthly  or annual  payment  current;  and \n\u2022  The amount  needed  to bring  the reserve account  current  less any authorized \nwithdrawals.  \n \nThe Loan  Servicer must  base the amount  of indebtedness  to be assumed  on current \nappraisal regulations.  \n \nIn the case of a transfer with assumption of less than the full debt, the Loan Servicer \nwill attach  a copy  of Form  RD 3560- 52 to Form  RD 3560- 21 MFH  Assumption  Agreement, \nand place it in the field office safe.  \n2. Adjustments  to the Account  \nSame -terms transfers, when the transferor has been converted to Predetermined \nAmortization  Schedule  System  (PASS),  must  take place in a current  loan status  on the date of \ntransfer.  Thus, transferors must bring any delinquent principal and interest current prior to \nthe transfer.  \n \nOverpayments and advance regular payments made on PASS accounts result in the \ncreation of a future paid status account under Automated Multi -Family Housing Accounting \nSystem  (AMAS).  The Loan  Servicer  must  work  with NFAOC to determine  the disposition of \nfuture payments; e.g., as a refund to transferor or applied as an extra payment to the \ntransferee's account.  Loan Servicers should refer to the AMAS Manual, Chapter 4, for \nadditional guidance and document the verified information with NFAOC prior to closing. \nB. Prepare the Closing  Package  \n1. Basic Components  of the Docket  \nThe Loan Servicer should verify that any items listed in the Transfer Request \nChecklist  (Attachment 7-D) and not provided earlier;  e.g., evidence of insurance,  have  been \nsubmitted by the transferee.

It will take extensive cooperation by existing owners, \npotential  purchasers,  non-Rural  Development  financiers,  and Rural  Development  to help \npreserve this irreplaceable affordable rental housing option in rural America.  \n \nRural Development will seek to find solutions to extend and enhance the use of each MFH \nproperty that continues to serve the affordable housing needs in its community. This \nattachment  establishes guidance  for revitalizing  MFH  projects  using the transfer  authority  of \n[7 CFR part 3560]. \n \nRevitalization  Principles.  The goal of revitalization  is to refocus  resources on existing \nproperties so they can meet affordable rental housing needs well into the future.  Basic \nrevitalization principles are summarized below.  \n \n1. There  is a need  for the property in the community.  \n2. When  the transaction  is complete,  the property will be in the hands  of eligible  owners. \n3. The transaction  will address the physical  needs  of the property.  \n4. Existing  tenants  will not be displaced  because of increased  post-transaction  rents.  \n5. Post-transaction  basic rents  will not exceed  comparable  market  rents.  \n6. Any equity loan amount  will be supported by a market  value  appraisal.  \n7. The PDLD concurs with equity loan amounts and new RTO, and coordinates the \napproval  of waivers,  National  Office  approvals,  or revitalization  related  policy  issues.  \n \nThese principles  must  be documented by Rural  Development\u2019s  loan servicer.  \n \nUse effective processing strategies.  Rural Development must work effectively to help \npurchasers  to meet  timeframes  and other  requirements  of third -party  funding sources.  Key \nmethods to foster cooperation and efficiencies within State Office jurisdictions include: \n \n \n ",

The following discussion explains how the same unit type \nmay have multiple Basic Rents in a Section 515 property with LIHTC. Rural Development refers to these \nsituations  as Tax Credit Rents.  Note  Rate Rents  are not affected  and continue  to be set in the same  manner  as \nin non- LIHTC properties.  \n \nIn most  States,  the competition  for LIHTCs  is intense.  Most  LIHTC  allocation  agencies provide  priorities  for \nproposals that provide for deeper affordability than the LIHTC minimum.  Accordingly, a USDA borrower \nwill sometimes propose transfers with multiple Tax Credit Rents in which a single unit may encompass two or more area median income levels.  \n \nUnit \nType  LIHTC  \nAllocation  # Units  Maximum \nLIHTC  \nRent RD Basic \nRent LIHTC  \nCredit \nRent Note  Rent \n1 BR 40% AMI  2 units  $283  $356  $283  $522  \n1 BR 50% AMI  2 units  $389  $356  $369  $522  \n1 BR 60% AMI  4 units  $455  $356  $435  $522  \n       \n2 BR 40% AMI  8 units  $312  $420  $312  $597  \n2 BR 50% AMI  8 units  $410  $420  $412  $597  \n2 BR 60% AMI  16 units  $508  $420  $489  $597  \n       \n3 BR 40% AMI  2 units  $341  $515  $341  $772  \n3 BR 50% AMI  2 units  $410  $515  $451  $772  \n3 BR 60% AMI  4 units  $562  $515  $545  $772  \n       \n       \nTotal   48 $250,320  $244,896  $244,896  $353,472  \nFor proposed transfers involving  Tax Credit  Rents,  the Loan  Servicer  must  determine  whether  the \nproposed rents  will provide  sufficient revenue  to cover  project costs  including an adequate Transfer \nto Reserve.

Rural  Development  staff members  are not responsible for assuring  that borrowers \nare satisfying  LIHTC  compliance  requirements.  The LIHTC  allocating  agency  is responsible  for LIHTC \ncompliance monitoring.

  "page_241": "HB\u20103\u20103560   \n ATTACHMENT 7\u2010C \nPAGE 2 OF 3  \n \nIn LIHT C properties, borrowers have powerful incentives to rent units only  to households  with incomes  in \nthe appropriate  bracket  to avoid losing  LIHTC  for that unit during the entire  period of occupancy. One \npractical  implication  is that the borrower  will need  to maintain  multiple  waiting  lists for the various  LIHTC \nallocations.  Accordingly, Rural Development  staff should expect that borrowers will hold units vacant if \nthere  is no one on the waiting  list in the appropriate  income  bracket, which  could lead to increased  vacancy \nlosses in these projects.  Rural  Development  staff should consider these factors carefully in judging  the \nviability of the proposed transfer and in approving the proposed rent, vacancy  allowance,  and O&M \nexpenses.  \n \nIn LIHTC  properties, it would be desirable  if Rural  Development  could require  that the LIHTC  allocation  be \nassigned  to a specific unit. However,  this is not possible  and, the units  will float throughout  the property  as a \nresult of tenant turnover.  \n \nAt the time that the Tax Credit Rents are implemented, Rural Development will require that the affected \nunits be assigned based on tenant incomes (for example, the lowest 2 BR rent will be assigned to units \noccupied by the 2 BR tenants  with the lowest  incomes),  and without  regard  to whether  tenants  are receiving \nRA. \n \nAvailable RA will be assigned in accordance with existing Handbook requirements, see HB -2-3560, \nParagraph  8.10.

In such cases, the Agency will consider restructuring the borrower\u2019s \nsecurity, so long as doing so will not only help the property, but also be in the best int erest of the \ntenants and the Government.  Potential security restructuring activities that may be approved include subordinations and junior liens, disposition of security property, leasing of security property, and other liens against a property or other assets.  \nThis chapter describes the requirements regarding such security restructuring requests \nand Agency procedures for reviewing and approving those requests.  \nSECTION 1:  SUBORDINATIONS AND JUNIOR LIENS  \n[7 CFR 3560.409]  \n8.2   OVERVIEW  \nBorrowers may request a subordination or junior lien for any type of Agency loan.  Prior \nAgency consent is required for all subordinations and junior liens. \nBecause the requirements and procedures for subordinations and junior liens are so \nsimilar, they have been combined in this section.  Where necessary, specific differences between the requirements and procedures for the two are identified. \n8.3   REQUIRED CONDITIONS  \nThe Leadership Designee  may grant consent to subordinations or junior liens if the \nborrower adequately documents that the request is consistent with the conditions listed in Exhibit \n8-1. \nIf a junior lien is placed on any property without prior Agency consent, the Leadership \nDesignee may pursue liquidation of the account.  \n8-1 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623 ",
  "page_246": "HB-3-3560  \nExhibit 8 -1 \nRequired Conditions for Subordinations or Junior Liens  \n\u2022 The action will enable the borrower to obtain credit to make needed improvements or repairs on \nthe property in circumstances where a loan of the same type involved could be made and funds \nin the reserve account have been depleted.  Repair costs should be reasonable and consistent \nwith the local market;  \n\u2022 The action will improve the borrower\u2019s total financial condition or debt -paying ability;  \n\u2022 The borrower is unable to refinance the loan on terms that can reasonably be expected to be met \nyet still meet the intent of the program;  \n\u2022 The action will not result in an unauthorized rent increase for the project or result in basic rents \nthat exceed the Conventional Rents for Comparable Units (CRCU) standard as discussed in Chapter 4 of HB -2-3560;  \n\u2022 The lienholder agrees in writing that foreclosure action under its lien will not be initiated before \nholding a discussion with the MFH Servicing official , and after giving a reasonable period of \nnotice to the Agency, and certifies that its operating plans are consistent with Agency requirements;  \n\u2022 Security for the subordination or junior lien appears adequate;  \n\u2022 The transaction must further loan objectives and not adversely affect the Agency\u2019s security;  \n\u2022 The total debt against the security after the transaction does not exceed the appraised value of \nthe property and is within the Leadership Designee \u2019s approval authority;  \n\u2022 There is no future advance clause that would allow the lender to advance additional money and \nmaintain the security or mortgage position; and  \n\u2022 All other applicable regulatory requirements have been met.  \n \n8.4   EVALUATING BORROWER REQUESTS FOR SUBORDINATIONS AND \nJUNIOR LIENS  \nThe Leadership Designee  will approve subordinations and junior liens only if they \ngenerally improve a borrower\u2019s financial condition and allow for completion of improvements or repairs in cases of underfunded reserve accounts. MFH Servicing official s need to ensure that the \nrequest does not alter project operations to make it ineligible under Agency requirements.  In addition, the subordination must not adversely affect the Agency\u2019s ability to service the loan according to program regulations, and must be determined to be within the bounds of good judgment considering the intent, funding limitations, and respective program authorities. When evaluating borrower requests for subordinations or junior liens, MFH Servicing official s will \nreview the request and check that the requirements listed in Exhibit 8- 2 have been met.  \nIn most cases, the Agency will not require an appraisal of the property when a \nsubordination or junior lien is proposed.  For subordinations, the Agency needs to look more closely at the amount of non\u2013Agency debt being assumed and to determine whether its secondary lien position is sufficient security for the remaining outstanding debt.  In some cases, this determination may require an appraisal.  For junior liens, appraisals are almost never \n__________________________________________________________________________________________  \n8-2 \n  ",

Appraisals are unnecessary in such cases because the Agency retains its lien position.  In either case, the Agency needs to determine whether projects are still in compliance with the conventional rents for comparable units standard following the subordination or junior lien.  The Leadership Designee decides when appraisals will be required.  \nAll requests for consent to subordinations or junior liens that do not satisfy the criteria of \nExhibit 8- 2 must be submitted to the Agency  with complete comments and recommendations \nfrom both the MFH Servicing official  and Leadership Designee, and all of the borrower\u2019s case \nfiles.  The Agency  will review such requests on a case- by-case basis, and appropriate \nauthorization will be granted or withheld depending on the individual merits of the proposal and its compatibility with program requirements.  \nMFH Servicing official s should follow the procedures in Paragraph 8.5 when evaluating \nthese requests.  \n \n8-3 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623 ",

Recommendations to Leadership Designee \nIf there are no violations at the property and all other applicable criteria are met, MFH \nServicing official s forward a properly completed and executed copy of Form RD 3560- 1 \nto the Leadership Designee.  Accompanying Form RD 3560- 1 should be a memo \ncontaining all information needed to justify approval or disapproval of the request, \nincluding an agreement from any new prior lienholder to provide the Agency advance notice of foreclosure.  As appropriate, MFH Servicing official s will also obtain junior \nlienhol der consent to any transaction and use of proceeds prior to approval of the \ntransaction.  When all required documentation has been assembled, the MFH Servicing official  will forward the subordination and junior lien request to the Leadership Designee  \nfor review.  \nD.  Final Decision  \nIf the Leadership  Designee agrees with the MFH Servicing official \u2019s determination, \nthey will forward the subordination or junior lien request to the Office of General Counsel (OGC) for review of legal sufficiency and closing comments.  After OGC \nreview, the closing process will begin.

Appraisal Procedures  \nThe Leadership Designee  may request an appraisal at any time deemed appropriate.  \nAs stated in Paragraph 8.4, most subordinations and junior liens will not require an \nappraisal.  If an appraisal is deemed necessary, an Agency official authorized to make appraisals for the type o f project involved will prepare an appraisal report.  Alternatively, \nthe new creditor may perform the appraisal as part of the due diligence process.  If an appraisal that is less than one year old is available, it may be used in lie u of a new \nappraisal.  \n8-5 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623 ",

Unauthorized assistance includes the following categories:  \n \n\u2022 The recipient was not eligible for the assistance;  \n \n\u2022 The property, as approved, does not qualify for the program (e.g., a property clearly \nabove modest in size, design, or cost, or that was not located in an area designated as \nrural when the initial loan was made); \n \n\u2022 The loan or grant was made for unauthorized purposes (e.g., purchase of an excessive amount of land);  \n \n\u2022 The recipient was granted unauthorized subsidy in the form of interest credits, rental assistance, or a subsidy benefit received through use of an incorrect interest rate; and  \n____________________________________________________________________________________________\n_ \n9-1 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623 ",

In deter mining whether to \nrecapture unauthorized assistance, the Agency will consider the cost -effectiveness of such action \ngiven the amount of unauthorized assistance, the availability of records to support the Agency\u2019s determination, and any applicable statute of limitations.  \n However, there are certain circumstances where repayment of the unauthorized assistance \nwill not be the agreed -to corrective action. The Agency may forgo collection of unauthorized \nassistance if the following conditions are met:  \n \n\u2022 A demand for recovery of the unauthorized assistance was made;  \n \n\u2022 The unauthorized assistance did not result from inaccurate or false information \nknowingly or fraudulently provided by a borrower or tenant;  \n  \n\u2022 The Agency determines that the borrower or tenant is unable to comply with the \nunauthorized assistance repayment demand, but is otherwise willing and able to meet Agency requirements; and \n \n\u2022 The Agency determines that it is in the best interest of the Federal Government to forgo collection of the unauthorized assistance.  \n \nAt the other extreme, the Agency can also choose to initiate liquidation or enforcement \nproceedings against a recipient of unauthorized assistance on a case- by-case basis.  \n9-2 ",

If OIG conducts an investigation, the Agency\u2019s notification and collection procedures will be deferred until t he investigation is completed.  \n \n9.5   REQUIREMENTS FOR IDENTIFYING UNAUTHORIZED ASSISTANCE  \n \nIdentification of unauthorized assistance may be accomplished by the Agency or by \nborrowers in cases involving tenant fraud.  The Agency may use all available means to identify unauthorized assistance, including audit reports, monitoring activities, and information provided by reliable sources  including the Treasury Department\u2019s Do Not Pay (DNP) Portal.

This section \noutlines the procedures employed to correct unauthorized assistance, including procedures for both audit and non- audit cases.  \n \n9.10   ACCOUNT ADJUSTMENTS \u2013 AUDIT CASES  \n \nWhen a final determination has been \nmade through an OIG audit that unauthorized assistance has been granted, the MFH Servicing \nofficial will be notified of necessary account adjustments by OIG and the Leadership Designee.  \n Only cases of unauthorized assistance \nidentified by OIG audits are reported to the MFH Servicing official.  In such cases, the Automated Multi -Family Housing Accounting System \n(AMAS) will be updated with the correct information, if the unauthorized assistance affects establishment of the loan interest rate or closing information.  \n  The chosen method of corrective action depends on the type of unauthorized assistance.  \nThe following text describes the actions that MFH Servicing officials must take to correct each type of unauthorized assistance.  \n A. Unauthorized Loan  \n For an active borrower with an unauthorized loan, if the problem causing the \nassistance to be unauthorized can be corrected, appropriate corrective action will be required.  For example:  \n \n\u2022 Where a loan was in excess of the authorized amount, the Agency will require the recipient to refund the difference;  \n \n\u2022 Where the loan included funds for purchase of excess land, the Agency will require \nthe recipient to sell the excess land and apply the proceeds to the account as an extra \npayment; and \n \n\u2022 Where a restrictive -use provision was omitted from a loan document, the Agency will \ninsert the provision.  \n \nTypes of Unauthorized Assistance  \n\u2022Unauthorized loan  \n\u2022Unauthorized subsidy benefits received through \nuse of incorrect interest rate  \n\u2022Unauthorized interest credit or rental assistance  \n\u2022Unauthorized grant assistance  \n___________________________________________________________________________  \n9-7 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623 ",
  "page_265": "HB-3-3560 \n B. Unauthorized Subsidy Benefits Received Through Use of Incorrect Interest Rate \n When the recipient was eligible for the loan but should have been charged a higher \ninterest rate than that shown in the debt instrument, resulting in the receipt of unauthorized subsidy benefits, the Agency must correct the interest rate to that which was in effect when the loan was approved. \n \n\u2022 MFH Servicing officials must ensure that all payments made are reversed and reapplied at the correct interest rate and future installments will be scheduled at the correct interest rate;  \n \n\u2022 The Agency will service any delinquency thus created in accordance with applicable Agency procedures;  \n \n\u2022 After reapplication of payments, the Agency will service the loan as an authorized \nloan; and  \n \n\u2022 Continuation of existing terms is authorized when the recipient is a public body with \nloans secured by bonds on which the interest rate cannot legally be changed or payments reversed or reapplied.  \n \nC. Unauthorized Interest Credit or Rental Assistance  In cases involving rental assistance or interest credit, the subsidy benefits should be \nterminated as provided in Form RD 3560- 9.  The Agency will service unauthorized rental \nassistance as a delinquent account, see Chapter 10.  \n \nD. Unauthorized Grant Assistance  \n When the recipient will repay unauthorized grant assistance over a period of time, the \nAgency will charge interest at the rate specified in the grant agreement for default from the date received until paid. \n \n\u2022 The Agency will schedule repayment over a period consistent with the recipient\u2019s repayment ability but not to exceed 10 years;  \n \n\u2022 The MFH Servicing official must maintain collection records, as the St. Louis Office \ncannot set up an account for repayment of a grant.

Cases Where Recipient Has Both Authorized and Unauthorized Loans \nOutstanding  \n \nWhen a recipient has both authorized and unauthorized loans outstanding, the Agency \nwill schedule installments to be paid concurrently on all loans.  The Agency will service \neach loan according to the loan servicing regulations in effect for an authorized loan of its type.  \n \nF. Liquidation Pending  \n When the Agency initiates liquidation, MFH Servicing officials enter data into \nAMAS and the account will be flagged accordingly.  The account is overseen by Agency personnel .  \n \nG. Liquidation Not Initiated  \n Cases in which liquidation have not been initiated because the outstanding amount is \nless than $1,000 or it would not be in the Agency\u2019s best interest to do so will be adjusted, \nand the adjustments will be entered into AMAS.  In this instance only, the  Leadership \nDesignee may make adjustments without the recipient\u2019s signature.  \n As requested, the Leadership Designee will report to OIG on the status of cases of \nunauthorized assistance identified in OIG audit reports and tracked by MFH Servicing officials.  The amounts to be reported will be determined by the Field Office after servicing actions have been completed. \n \n9.11   ACCOUNT ADJUSTMENTS \u2013 NONAUDIT CASES  \n \nServicing procedures are essentially the same for audit and nonaudit  cases.  However, \nwhen the Agency identifies receipt of unauthorized assistance by a means other than an OIG audit report, the St. Louis Office will be notified only if adjustments to an active account or reinstatement of an inactive account are needed or grant funds are repaid.  \n Once the appropriate adjustments are made, the Agency will treat the loan(s) as an \nauthorized loan(s).

Overview  \n To collect unauthorized assistance, MFH Servicing officials must follow the \nfollowing steps described in subparagraph 9.14 A.1 through A.5:  \n \n1. Coordination w ith OGC  \n MFH Servicing officials  may need to work with OGC to determine the appropriate \nstatute of limitations before making a decision to collect.  \n \n2.  Notification to Recipient  \n The Agency will seek to collect unauthorized assistance  from borrowers, up \nto the applicable statute of limitations for any particular amount of unauthorized assistance.  \n   \nCoordination with OGC ( if needed to \ndetermine the appropriate statute of limitations ) and the  Agency via e -mail must occur before proceeding with the initial \nnotification to the recipient when: (a) the debt extends beyond one year, and (b) the amount of unauthorized assistance for that year is greater than or equal to $1,000.  The period of review for ca ses meeting the criteria of (a) and (b) will extend to 3 years.  \n The MFH Servicing official will initiate collection efforts in the notice described in the Section 3 of this chapter.  Handbook Letter 304 (3560) will be used for this notice .  The \nMFH Servicing official mails the notice to the recipient by certified mail, with a copy to \nthe Leadership Designee  and, for a case identified in an OIG audit report, a copy to the \nOIG office that conducted the audit and a copy to  the Financial Management Division . \nThe MFH Servicing official will send the notice to all recipients who received unauthorized assistance, regardless of the amount.

Collection  \n If the recipient does not prevail in an appeal, or when an appeal is not requested \nduring the time allowed, the MFH Servicing official will proceed with either liquidation or legal action to enforce collection.  The Agency allows for  repayment of all \nunauthorized assistance either in a lump sum or from a monthly repayment schedule without the charging of interest if the recipient pays the debt in full within 90 days  from \nthe date of debt on Form RD 3560- 65.

Procedures for Collection of Unauthorized Assistance  \n \nFollowing the final Agency determination of unauthorized assistance, MFH Servicing \nofficials must take the following steps:  \n \n\u2022 Notify the SO -Multi -Family Housing Branch, Project Loan Servicing Section (PLSS)  \nof the debt to be established  via the MFH Transactions Queue by attach ing the Form \nRD 3560- 65. PLSS may also receive a signed memo for any correction adjustments to \nthe debt  (initialed by Debtor and Agency)  via the MFH Transactions Queue.  \nPayments are to be mailed to the Unauthorized Assistance lockbox address:  Rural \nDevelopment, P.O. Box 970005, St. Louis, MO  63197- 0005.  In all  communications, \nprecaution must be taken to prevent the distribution of any Personally Identifiable Information (PII).    \n\u2022 Restructure accounts so that all money owed is collected and no borrowers are receiving assistance to which they are not entitled.  This is normally accomplished on a case -by-case basis, with appropriate involvement of the management agent and \ntenant in ca ses where the tenant receives unauthorized assistance.  Otherwise, it is \naccomplished on a case -by-case basis for repayment by the borrower in 3 months or \nless.  Upon demand, borrowers must repay any unauthorized rental assistance and/or return on investme nt; sometimes this may be achieved through a workout agreement \nwith the Agency.  If 3 months is not a feasible timeframe for complete repayment, the Leadership Designee can make an exception where justified.  \n \n\u2022 After submitting the agreement, Form RD 3560- 65, to PLSS via the MFH \nTransactions Queue , the MFH Servicing officials may view the Account in CLSS and \nMFIS.   \n \nThe specific procedures to be followed in each case will depend on the reason for the \nunauthorized assistance (i.e., borrower error or Agency error).  The procedures associated \nwith each cause of unauthorized assistance are discussed below.  \n \n1. Borrower Error  \n \n\u2022 Borrower actions that require borrower repayment of unauthorized assistance \nreceived by tenants  include , but are not limited to: \n \na) Incorrect determination of tenant income or household status by the borrower, resulting in rental assistance or interest credit that is not allowable under the provisions of subparts D, E, or F of 7 CFR part 3560, as applicable; or  \nb)  Assignment of rental assistance to a household that is ineligible under the requirements of subpart F of 7 CFR  part 3560.  If the borrower assigned rental \nassistance incorrectly even though the tenant correctly reported income and household size, the borrower will first notify the MFH Servicing official.  If the \nMFH Servicing official verifies that the error was made based on information that \nwas available at the time the unit was assigned, the borrower or management \n9-14 ",
  "page_272": "HB-3-3560 \nagent will give the tenant a 30- day written notice that the unit was assigned in \nerror and that the rental assistance benefit will be canceled effective on the next \nmonthly rental payment due after the end of the 30 -day notice period.  In such \ncases, MFH Servicing officials must e nsure that borrowers grant tenants the \nchance to cancel their lease without penalty at the time the rental assistance is canceled or appeal the decision. The written notice will provide that:  the rental assistance will be assigned to the next eligible hou sehold based on Form RD \n3560- 29, from which the original priority was established when the unit was \nerroneously assigned.  The rental assistance will not be retroactive unless the reassignment was based on an appeal by the tenant.  Retroactive rental assistance may not exceed the project\u2019s remaining rental assistance obligation balance.  \n\u2022 Borrowers should not charge tenants amounts due to the Agency as a result of unauthorized assistance to tenants through borrower error.  (See 7 CFR section 3560.708(d) ). \n \n\u2022 Restitution for unauthorized rental assistance that is the borrower\u2019s fault will be handled as a refund.  \n Exhibit 9 -1 lists the specific actions that MFH Servicing officials must take to attempt to \nrecapture unauthorized assistance to borrowers.  \n  \n__________________________________________________________________________________  \n9-15 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623 ",

Agencies are required by law to \ntransfer debts that are 180 days delinquent , nontax, legally enforceable to Treasury for collection.   \n Exhibit 9 -4 lists the general procedures that MFH Servicing officials must follow when \nimplementing Treasury Referral . \n \n9.21   GENERAL TREASURY REFERRAL PROCESS   \n \nThe Agency does not perform Administrative Offsets, Salary Offsets, or IRS Offsets.  \nThese tools are used by the U.S. Treasury once a debt has been determined eligible and subsequently referred to Treasury.  In addition to the various types of offsets, the  U.S. Treasury \nmay also use wage garnishment and private collection agencies, to attempt collection of a debt.  A brief process is as follows:   \n \n\u2022 The Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (DCIA)  provides additional collection \nremedies to  Treasury for collecting delinquent debts Government wide.  \n \n\u2022 Prior to submitting the debt to Treasury, SO -Debt Management Branch  issues the debtor \na 60- Day Due Process Letter.  This letter explains the debt and rights of the debtor as \nrequired by law .  DCIA requires debts to be referred for Cross Servicing at 180 days \ndelinquent. Debts that are referred to the Treasury Offset Program are referred at 120 days delinquent .  See 7 CFR section 3.30. If the debtor begins making  full payments as \nagreed upon by the repayment plan as a  result of the 60 -day notice , the debt will not be \nreferred.  \n \n\u2022 Once the debt is referred for Cross Servicing, Treasury begins collecting the debt.  Cross -\nServicing is the process whereby federal agencies refer delinquent debts to Treasury for collection. Treasury will use various tools in an attempt to collect these d ebts.  Some of \nthese tools are such things as offsetting any government payments (tax refunds, federal salary payroll, all vendor payments, etc.), wage garnishment and the use of private collection agencies, to attempt collection of a debt.  \n \n\u2022 SO-Debt Management Branch  is responsible for maintaining communications with \nTreasury on all aspects of the debts referred, including but not limited to full collection of the debt.  \n \n\u2022 Once a debt goes to T reasury, it can only be recalled if it was referred in error or under \nother extenuating circumstances. I f the debtor starts to make payments again, if paid to \nTreasury, part of the collection goes back to Treasury. Payments made to the Agency will \n9-23 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623 ",
  "page_281": "HB-3-3560 \n be processed and notification of the payment will be sent to Treasury. Resuming \npayments requires that a revised form RD 3560- 65 be sent to SO -MFHB.  \n  \nExhibit 9 -4 \nGeneral Procedures for Implementing Treasury Referral  \n \nNotify debtors of intent to use Treasury referral.   Notify debtors of the Agency\u2019s intent to use Treasury \nreferral.  If the debtor requests a meeting to discuss the matter, schedule the meeting and advise the debtor of \nthe date, time, and place.  This does not replace the 60-day  due process letter sent by SO /Debt Management \nBranch.  \n\u2022 Inform debtor of their rights.   Inform debtor that they have 15 days after receipt of notification to \ninspect/copy records, and 30 days  to either make a written submission, request a meeting, or appeal.  Inform \ndebtors of when and where records may be inspected and/or copied.  \n\u2022 Respect debtors\u2019 rights.   Ensure that debtors\u2019 rights are respected (e.g., the right to inspect and copy records, \nthe right to avoid Treasury referral by paying debts in full within 30 days, the right to present reasons why \nTreasury referral should not be used, the right to reque st meetings with the decision -making official, and the \nright to appeal the decision).  \n\u2022 Communicate effectively with debtors.   Make decisions promptly, within 15 days, after a meeting with the \ndebtor and communicate them in writing to the debtor.  If a request from a debtor not to use Treasury referral \nis denied, the letter communicating that decision should advise the debtor of  their rights to appeal to the \nNational Appeals Division.  \n\u2022 Follow appropriate hearing procedures.   Inform debtors that they may request a hearing if they dispute any \nAgency finding.  Hearings can include consideration of any issues concerning the debt that the debtor wishes \nto raise.  Respond promptly to all written or oral requests or presentations m ade by debtors;  \n\u2022 Complete Form RD 3560 -65.  If it is determined that the debt is valid, complete Form RD 3560-65, \nfollowing the guidelines defined in the FMI.  \n\u2022 Notify PLSS of course of actions.   Provide the completed Form RD 3560-65 to SO/MFH/P LSS who will \nestablish the debt as a receivable.  The information on the Form RD 3560-65 will be the determining factor \nwhen and whether or not to begin Treasury Referral, including mailing the 60-Day  Due Process Letter to the \ndebtor(s). The P LSS group e -mailbox for MFH is RD.SO. MFH @usda.gov.  However, RD Form 3560-65 and \ninquiries  regarding Unauthorized Assistance shall be submitted via the MFH Transactions Queue SharePoint Site.         \n\u2022 If the debtor begins full payments as agreed upon by the repayment plan after the 60 -day due process letter, \nthen the debt will not be referred. However, if the debtor becomes delinquent again, a second 60-day notice \nwill not be provided and the debt will go directly to Treasury.  \n\u2022 Credit collections to debtor\u2019s account.   SO will receive and process transactions to the debtor\u2019s receivable \nrecord that are received from Treasury or through repayment agreements with the Agency.   \n\u2022 Request Debt Recall from Treasury. Once it is referred, debt may only be called once and only under extenuating circumstances.  If the debtor requests to begin making payments and the Agency decides that the \ndebt should be recalled from Treasury, a new agreement, Form RD 3560- 65 must be signed and submitted to \nPLSS via the \nMFH Transactions Queue  with a note a cross the top of the form requesting to recall the debt from \nTreasury. Debts will not be recalled more than once unless extenuating circumstances exist.    \n9-24 ",

Thus, a much more common scenario is to \ncontinue the loan account with a stipulation that some or all of the unauthoriz ed assistance will \nbe collected, either immediately or over time.  This way, the Agency can continue to meet the \nneeds of low -income tenants while still responsibly protecting the taxpayers\u2019 interest in the RHS \nportfolio.  \n \n9.23   REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTINUATION OF LOAN ACCOUNTS  \n[7 CFR 3560.707]  \n \nIf a recipient of unauthorized assistance is willing to pay the amount in question but \ncannot repay within a reasonable period of time, the Agency may continue to service the account if the recipient has the legal and financial capabilities to continue.  \n When the borrower is responsible for the circumstances causing the assistance to be \nunauthorized, the borrower must take appropriate action to correct the problem.  When unauthorized assistance is due to Agency actions, the Agency will correct the problem.   When \ncircumstances resulting in a determination of unauthorized assistance cannot be corrected, the Agency may, at its discretion, decide that continuation on existing terms is appropriate.  \n \n9.24   AGENCY DECISION TO CONTINUE SERVICING ACCOUNT  \n \nIf a recipient is willing to pay the amount in question but cannot repay within a \nreasonable period of time, the Agency can  continue  to service the account.  The Agency can take \nappropriate servicing actions to continue the account if:  \n \n\u2022 The recipient did not provide false information;  \n \n\u2022 Requiring prompt repayment of the unauthorized assistance would be highly \ninequitable; and \n \n\u2022 Failure to collect the unauthorized assistance in full will not adversely affect the Agency\u2019s financial interest.  \n \n9.25   SERVICING OPTIONS IN LIEU OF LIQUIDATION OR LEGAL ACTION TO COLLECT  \n \nWhen the conditions for continuation of the account are met, the MFH Servicing official \nwill service an unauthorized loan or grant, provided the recipient has the legal and financial capabilities to continue.

  "page_283": "HB-3-3560 \n A. Agency Actions  \n \nGenerally, borrower accounts need to be restructured so that the Agency collects all \nmoney due it and so that no borrower is receiving assistance to which they are not entitled.  The MFH Servicing official accomplishes this result through the account adjustments described below.  In most cases requiring such corrective actions, the MFH Servicing official reports to the Leadership Designee, who often consults with OGC on \nfurther actions.  \n \nB. Notice of Determination When Agreement is Not Reached  \n If the recipient does not agree with the Agency determination of unauthorized \nassistance or does not respond to the initial letter within 30 days , the MFH Servicing \nofficial must send a second certified letter (to the same recipients) specifying the final amount determined by the Agency to be unauthorized, further actions to be taken by the Agency, and the recipient\u2019s appeal rights.  \n \nC. Reporting to OIG  \n At prescribed intervals, the St. Louis Office will report to OIG on the status of cases \ninvolving unauthorized assistance which were identified by OIG in audit reports.  The St. Louis Office will determine the amounts to be reported to OIG after account se rvicing \nactions have been completed.  For reporting purposes, the procedures outlined below apply.  \n \n1. Unauthorized Loan  \n When a borrower repays an unauthorized loan account in full  (if allowed under the \nprepayment regulations found at 7 CFR 3560, Subpart N.)  MFH Servicing officials should include that payment in the next scheduled report only.  When the Agency approves continuation with the loan on existing terms, MFH Servicing officials will \nreport the case as resolved on the next scheduled report.

Unauthorized Subsidy  \n For unauthorized subsidy cases, after the borrower has repaid the unauthorized \namount or payments have been reversed and reapplied at the correct interest rate, MFH Servicing officials should include the unauthorized subsidy as resolved in the next \nscheduled report.  No further reporting is required. \n \n3.

Most enforcement actions will require close coordination with OGC, which will \ndevelop the Agency\u2019s enforcement approach based on information supplied by MFH Servicing officials.

Liquidation  (7 CFR 3560.456)  \n \nIn the case of an active borrower with a secured loan, the MFH Servicing official will \nattempt to have the recipient liquidate voluntarily subject to compliance with prepayment requirements.  If the recipient agrees, the MFH Servicing official will document the agreement with an entry in the running record of the case file. \n \nWhere real property is involved, the MFH Servicing official will prepare a letter to be \nsigned by the recipient agreeing to voluntary liquidation.  If the recipient does not agree to voluntary liquidation, or agrees but is unable to accomplish it within a reasonable period of time (usually not more than 90 days), the Agency will initiate forced liquidation action, unless the amount of unauthorized assistance outstanding totals less than $1,000 or it can be clearly documented that it would not be in the best  financial interest of the \nGovernment to force liquidation.  If a borrower meets either of the two criteria to forego forced liquidation, the Agency will make all necessary account adjustments without the recipient\u2019s signature and notify the recipient by l etter of the actions taken.  \n \nB.  Legal Action to Enforce Collection  \n \nIn the case of a grantee, inactive borrower, or active borrower with an unsecured loan \n(e.g., collection- only or unsatisfied balance after liquidation), the MFH Servicing official \nwill document the facts in the case file and submit it to the Leadership Designee , who \nwill request the advice of OGC on pursuing legal action to effect collection.  The \nLeadership Designee will tell OGC what assets, if any, are available from which to \ncollect.  The Leadership Designee will forward the case file, recommendation of  the \nLeadership Designee, and OGC comments to the Agency for review and authorization to implement recommended servicing actions.  \n9-29 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623 ",

To protect the security value of a property, it is in the Agency\u2019s \nbest interest to work with the borrower to resolve any compliance violations.  Resolving situations of noncompliance is the main subject of this chapter.  \nMFH Servicing official s should be firm in dealing with the borrower or the borrower\u2019s \nrepresentative in matters of compliance violations.  Because the management agent is not the party ultimately responsible for the loan, it is imperative that the borrower be directly apprised of and fully understands the consequences of default.  Therefore, whenever any written servicing notice is sent to a management agent who is not the borrower, the borrower must also receive a copy of the notice.  MFH Servicing officia ls need to employ courtesy, cooperation, and sound \njudgment when interacting with borrowers and management agents in any servicing situation. \nA noncompliance situation is often resolved or deterred through a work -out agreement.  \nThis is a plan for resolving or deterring noncompliance that is developed and presented by a borrower to the Agency for approval.  The Agency may or may not approve the proposed work-out agreement.  This chapter discusses the Agency requirements for work -out agreements.  \n10.2   ADDRESSING COMPLIANCE VIOLATIONS AND DEFAULTS  \nBorrowers are in default of their loan or grant agreements whenever they are not in \ncompliance with the terms of the loan or grant agreement.  Such defaults may be of a monetary nature, such as when borrowers do not make their loan payments, or of a nonmonetary nature, \nsuch as when borrowers have not maintained projects properly.  Default may be triggered by events that are beyond the borrower\u2019s control, such as changing markets that lead to prolonged vacancies.  Nevertheless, being in default is a serious situation for a borrower and requires that every effort be made to resolve it.  \nDefaults may lead to foreclosure , loan liquidation, or the assessment of civil penalties .  \nOne significant step that can be taken toward resolving the default  is for the Agency and the \nborrower to agree to a work- out agreement.  A work- out agreement may also be used in certain \ncases to avert a default situation.  The Agency will not pursue enforcement against a borrower in default (monetary or nonmonetary) if a n approved work- out agreement is in place and on \nschedule.  Thus, it is in the borrower\u2019s best int erest to work with the Agency to resolve \ncompliance issues through a work- out agreement.  \nA work -out agreement is a proposal that is submitted by the borrower to the Agency for \napproval of changes in project operations, for additional time to restore compliance, or for servicing actions to assist in correcting identified deficiencies.  There ar e several servicing \noptions available under a work- out agreement, and the borrower and MFH Servicing official  \n10-1 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623 ",

It describes the process by which \nthe MFH Servicing official  notifies the borrower of compliance violations and the options \navailable to remedy the noncompliance.  The chapter then discusses work -out agreements and \nincludes a separate section on Special Note Rents (SNRs), which enable borrowers to reduce rents to a ttract tenants.  By reading this chapter, the MFH S ervicing official  will understand how \nto systematically work with the borrower to resolve noncompliance, when it is appropriate and feasible for a borrower to enter into a work -out agreement, what are the required terms of the \nagreement, and how to monitor borrower complia nce with the work -out agreement.  \n10-2 ",
  "page_299": "HB-3-3560  \nSECTION 1:  TYPES OF DEFAULTS [7 CFR 3560.452]  \n10.3   OVERVIEW  \nBorrowers in violation of the terms of the loan or grant documents for the project or \napplicable Federal regulations, including a work- out agreement, who fail to fully correct a \ndeficiency by a date specified by the Agency in a written notice are in default of their loan or \ngrant documents.  \nDefaults can be of a monetary or nonmonetary nature.  The Agency will initiate \nappropriate enforcement actions against any borrower in default. \n10.4   MONETARY DEFAULT  \nA project that is in monetary default is defined as one that is delinquent for more than 60 \ndays.  Projects with monetary violations include those for which the loans have been accelerated \nand of which the borrowers are in bankruptcy.  A project is delinquent when a loan payment is \nmore than 10 days past due.  Project payments are due on the date spe cified on Form RD 3560-\n52, Promissory Note . \nMonetary default may warrant the development of a work -out agreement or initiation of \nenforcement actions by the Agency that include termination of a management agreement, receivership, suing for performance, collection of unauthorized assistance, or denial of a rent increase.  \n10.5   NONMONETARY DEFAULT  \nNonmonetary defaults include, but are not limited to, failing to maintain project reserves, \nfailing to adequately maintain the physical condition of the property, failing to comply with environmental mitigation measures, occupying units with ineligible tenants without prior Agency approval, charging incorrect rents, failing to meet fair housing requirements, and failing to properly report to the Agency.  A borrower will be considered in nonmonetary default if the identified deficiencies are not cured within  60 days  of notification. \nAttempts to resolve nonmonetary defaults should be handled whenever possible at the \nServicing Office  level with appropriate guidance and assistance from the Leadership Designee.  \nEnvironmental concerns, such as failure to comply with mitigation measures, should be reviewed with the Headquarters Environmental Staff  for further guidance.  The Leadership Designee  \nshould counsel with the Office of General Counsel (OGC) for advice, if needed, in servicing those cases where nonmonetary defaults cannot be resolved at the Servicing Office level.  These actions may include liquidation of the account, see Chapter 12.  \n10-3 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623 ",

This classification system provides a picture of \nthe status of the housing portfolio and flags those projects that need special servicing and/or \nmonitoring.  Exhibit 10- 1 shows how projects are classified.  \nThe Agency\u2019s classification system is to be used to focus servicing efforts.  Projects \nclassified as a D or a C should receive first priority when allocating resources to address portfolio concerns.  Internal supervisory reviews should primarily examine how MFH Servicing official s are working to address projects with servicing concerns.  \nThe classification system will be maintained on the Multi- Family Integrated System \n(MFIS).  Servicing official s are responsible for making sure that MFIS is current and accurately \nreflects a project\u2019s servicing status.  The supervisory visit and engagement review are key events for updating a project\u2019s servicing status.

When the Agency discovers a deficiency in a project  that requires \ncorrection but is not the equivalent of a violation or an unacceptable summary level finding \nduring an inspection or review report, the Agency must notify the borrower of this finding.  \nDepending on the severity of the finding, the servicing official may advise the borrower of the \nfinding either orally, or in writing through a monitoring letter.  Should the finding not be corrected after at least one written notice has been sent to the borrower with a specified date by which the finding must be corrected, the MFH Servicing official  must determine whether the \nissue should be elevated to a violation status.  When the MFH Servicing official  concludes that \nthe finding should be viewed as a violation that could lead to a default, the MFH Servicing official  must begin the process of issuing the servicing letters described in Paragraph 10.10.  \n10.8   VIOLATIONS  \nA violation is a finding that the Servicing Office escalates because of its severity or \nbecause of the type of servicing effort that will be needed to obtain compliance.  When the Agency designates a finding as a violation, it indicates a willingness to pursue the finding to the point of acceleration to have it corrected.  Compliance violations include, but are not limited to, any unacceptable summary level finding on the physical inspection report, project management and occupancy review, or engagement rev iew that could be updated at any time.  Examples \ninclude failing to make required contributions to project reserves, failing to adequately maintain the exterior physical condition of the property under Agency standards, failing to comply with environmental  mitigation measures, occupying units with ineligible tenants without prior Agency \napproval, charging incorrect rents, and failing to properly report to the Agency. \n10.9   KEY STEPS IN ADDRESSING COMPLIANCE VIOLATIONS AND DEFAULTS  \nThe Agency must respond quickly and systematically whenever a project is identified as \nbeing in noncompliance with program requirements.  In responding to a noncompliance \nsituation, the MFH Servicing official  will take some or all of the following steps and update the \nservicing status on MFIS:  \n\u2022 Notify the borrower of the violation and request corrective action;  \n\u2022 Meet with the borrower to discuss the problem and possible servicing actions to remedy the problem;  \n\u2022 Review any proposed work- out agreement developed by the borrower and suggest \nacceptable servicing actions if appropriate;  \n\u2022 Issue a problem case report; and  \n\u2022 Initiate enforcement actions to motivate the borrower to restore compliance.  \nThese steps are discussed in detail in the following sections. \n10-6 ",
  "page_303": "HB-3-3560  \n10.10   NOTIFICATION TO BORROWER OF SERVICING PROBLEMS  \nThe Agency must notify the borrower using formal servicing letters that state the need for \ncorrective action to be taken.  It is not the Agency\u2019s responsibility to come up with solutions to \nthe problems.  Rather, it is the borrower who must identify what corrective actions will take place immediately or over time through a work- out agreement.  \nThe Servicing Office will use a series of servicing letters to communicate with the \nborrower until the problem is resolved.  Copies of the letters must be sent to the management agent of the property that is the subject of the letters if the owner is not the management agent.  Exhibit 10- 2 shows the sequencing of these servicing letters. \nHandbook Letter 301 (3560) serves to trigger the start of a 60- day period for \nnonmonetary violations and a 45- day period for monetary violations, at the end of which the \nborrowers are in default of their loan agreement if the situation has not been resolved.  Resolution may take the  form of action proposed by the borrower and approved by the Agency, \nor it may take the form of enforcement actions instituted by the Agency when the borrower fails to res pond or responds inadequately.  \nA.  Preliminary Notification  \nWhen a borrower becomes delinquent on a payment, an automatically generated \nDelinquency Billing Statement is mailed to the borrower.  The borrower will be in default if the loan payment is not made in full within 60 days  of this notice. If the borrower does \nnot submit the loan payment before the payment is 30 days  past due, the borrower \nreceives Handbook Letter 301 (3560) .  If the borrower submits the full payment, \nincluding any applicable late fees (see Chapter 4, paragraph 4.4 on late fees) the MFH Servicing official  does not take any further servicing action. \nDuring an on- site monitoring visit the monitors should meet with the borrower to \nreview the initial results of the visit, including a discussion of compliance violations.  See Chapter 9, paragraph 9.6 B of HB -2-3560 for more information about on- site monitoring \nvisits.  \nExample:  Borrower B\u2019s project has several crumbling steps in the stairwell.  Since \nthis represents an unacceptable condition of exterior maintenance, which is a compliance violation, the MFH Servicing official  notifies the borrower during the on- site visit on this \nviolation. \n \n  \n10-7 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623  ",

A Delinquency Billing Statement \nis automatically sent to borrower when the borrower becomes \ndelinquent ( 10 days  past due).  \nLetter #1  Sent upon evidence of violation and \nno later than 30 days  after the \nmonitoring visit.  Date of letter \nsignifies beginning of 60-day period \nto default.  Sent no later than when payment is \n35 days  past due.  \n \nLetter #2  Sent sometime after 15 days  if \nborrower fails to respond or responds \ninadequately to Letter #1.  Notifies \nborrower of date by which they will \nbe considered delinquent if violation \nnot corrected (60 days after date of \nLetter #1).  Sent after payment is 45 days  past \ndue.  Notifies borrowers of date by \nwhich they will be classified a D \nproject (60 days after payment due \ndate).  \nLetter #3  Sent at least 60 days  after date of \nfirst letter and at least 15 days  after \nLetter #2 notifying borrowers that they are in default and warning of \nenforcement action if problem is not \ncorrected within 15 days.  Sent 60 days  after payment due \ndate notifying borrower that the Agency will take legal action to \ncure the default and warning of \nenforcement action if paym ent is \nnot made within 15 days.  \n \nB.  Borrowers with Multiple Servicing Issues  \nIf a borrower is in violation in several different areas, the Handbook Letter 301 \n(3560) should identify all the violations.  If sent, Handbook Letter 302 (3560)  would \nreference \u201congoing compliance violations\u201d to cover multiple servicing issues.  The series \nof letters continues until each violation has been resolved. \nA servicing letter may cite conditions of concern (see Paragraph 10.7) along with \ncompliance violations.  However, only the cited compliance violations could lead to a default status if left unresolved.  If the borrower resolves all violations within 60 days , \nthey will not default even if the conditions of c oncern have not been resolved. \nIf at any time the Agency discovers that a borrower who has received a servicing \nletter has another problem that warrants a servicing letter, the letter will be sent, triggering a second series of letters.  These letters can run separately from and independent of the first series of letters or they may be combined at some point.  However, it is important that the MFH Servicing official  track the separate violations \ncited by the date of each Handbook Letter 301 (3560)  so that Handbook Letter 303 (3560 \ncorre ctly identifies the violation that has resulted in the default by a certain date.  \n10-8 \n ",

The MFH Servicing official  will use the procedures outlined in Chapter 6.  Such \nan evaluation should come before any meeting with the borrower so that the MFH Servicing \nOfficial  is familiar with the project and its sta tus. \n10.12   MEETING WITH THE BORROWER  \nWhen the borrower proposes a work- out agreement in response to Handbook Letter 301 \n(3560), or when Handbook Letter 302 (3560) must be sent, the MFH Servicing official  must \nrequest a meeting with the borrower.  The purpose of the meeting is to identify and agree upon the servicing problem, establish the underlying causes of the problem, and begin to develop the \nparameters of a work -out agreement.  The MFH Servicing official  will discuss possible Agency \nservicing actions.  \nIt is the responsibility of the borrower , not the Agency, to propose and develop an \nacceptable work -out agreement.  However, borrowers may delegate authority to their \nmanagement agent to develop a work- out agreement.  A borrower may do this by signing a \nstatement in the management plan or certifying in a letter to the Agency that the management agent has the aut hority to act on their behalf.  \nOnce the work -out agreement is proposed, the MFH Servicing official  may propose \nservicing actions that are appropriate and acceptable to the Agency.

This might occur in the case of defaults that do \nnot affect the health and safety of tenants and where the cost of liquidation is significant relative to the violation, or where the costs of liquidation and providing adequate tena nt protections is \nhigh.  Available enforcement actions that the Agency can take include:  \n\u2022 Termination of the management agreement .  The Agency may terminate the \nmanagement agreement and require the borrower to hire new management;  \n\u2022 Receivership .  The Agency may appoint a third party to manage the project.

A borrower may submit a work-out agreement at any time in response to Agency notification of compliance problems or prior to that if the borrower feels that noncompliance is imminent.  \nThe work-out agreement may be a very simple one-page plan for resolving a single \nproblem, or it may be a more complex document of several pages that describes several plans of action to resolve a more complicated problem.  If a borrower does not develop a work-out plan, the MFH Servicing official  must develop a problem case report, in accordance with Paragraph \n10.14. \nAcceptable and successful work -out agreements depend upon some flexibility on the part \nof the MFH Servicing official and the borrower, thoughtful and project-specific servicing, and thorough and consistent monitoring that serves to track the progress of the agreement. \n10.17   CONDITIONS WARRANTING A WORK -OUT AGREEMENT  \nSerious compliance deficiencies that cannot be resolved promptly may warrant the \ndevelopment of a work- out agreement.  Such conditions may reflect a financial, physical, fair \nhousing, or occupancy deficiency. \nA.  Financial Deficiencies  \nFinancial deficiencies that may require a work -out agreement include: \n\u2022 Inadequate cash flow to meet project needs.  Cash flow should be adequate to pay \nAgency debt, meet reserve requirements, pay taxes, pay insurance, pay other project expenses, and pay any authorized return on owner investment when earned; \n\u2022 Projects that are 60 days past due; \n\u2022 Seriously underfunded reserve accounts that cannot be brought up to required levels \nwithin a normal budget cycle or where unauthorized withdrawals have been made; \nand \n\u2022 Borrowers who have not adhered to program requirements such as paying taxes, maintaining insurance, or submitting required financial information. \nB.

Occupancy Deficiencies  \nSerious vacancies that threaten property viability where management can furnish \nevidence that they have made efforts to increase occupancy may warrant a work -out \nagreement.  \n10.18   ELIGIBILITY FOR WORK -OUT AGREEMENTS  \nThe Agency will consider work- out agreements only for properties:  \n\u2022 That are deemed to be program property; or   \n\u2022 Whose owners demonstrate a commitment to correcting property deficiencies. \nA.  Program Property  \nThe MFH Servicing official  must establish whether the project is suitable for the \nprogram using the guidance provided in Chapter 6.  If the project is deemed to be non-\nprogram property, a work- out agreement must not be considered.  \nB.  Owner Evaluation  \nAn owner who has not maintained compliance with prior work- out agreements and \nhas historically ignored Agency requests for corrective actions must not be considered eligible for a work -out agreement.  \n10.19   CONTENT OF A WORK -OUT AGREEMENT  \nAll work -out agreements must be in writing and executed by the borrower, or the \nborrower\u2019s designated representative, the management agent who manages the project (if different from the borrower), and the Agency before they take effect.

Term of Work -Out Agreement  \nThe maximum term of a work -out \nagreement is two years.  All \nagreements must be reevaluated annually as well as at the end of the two-year period.  The evaluation is \nbased on whether the plan realistically achieves financial viability and otherwise meets th e objectives for \nwhich the loan was made.  If an approved work- out agreement calls for \nactions that extend beyond a two- year \nperiod, borrowers must submit an updated and if necessary, revised work -out agreement to the Agency for \napproval.  The updated wor k-out \nagreement must be submitted to the Agency 30 days  prior to the expiration of the work-\nout agreement in effect.  The Agency may reexecute the agreement if satisfactory progress has been made.  \nNormally, work- out agreements should not exceed two years, especially if a plan calls \nfor less than full payment on an Agency loan, or less than full contribution to the reserve account.  Plans not meeting these criteria are normally not cons idered as viable and \nfeasible.  \nReserve Account Deficiencies  \nWhen seriously underfunded reserve levels \nare involved in an extended work- out time \nperiod, the MFH Servicing Official  should \nreassess the reserve level for the project and \nestablish a new reserve level, if appropriate.  A \ncapital needs assessment can be useful to make \nthis determination.  If re -funding the reserve to \nits new level will require more than two years, the bo rrower and MFH Servicing official  may \nwant to consider additional work- out terms so \nthat the project is not in continual need of \nrequiring a work -out agreement.  \n10-17 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623 ",

Approval of a work -out agreement is not guaranteed to a borrower.  Failure to \napprove a work- out agreement is not an adverse action by the Agency because the Agency is not \nrequired to grant approval of modifications to the terms of the loan for borrowers in default; thus, the Agency is not taking away any bo rrower rights by not approving the work- out agreement.  \nTherefore, failure to approve a work -out agreement is not appealable by a borrower, although the \nAgency\u2019s decision may be reviewed.  \n \n10-18 \n ",

Evaluation of Work -Out Agreement  \nThe Agency is under no obligation to offer or agree to any special servicing actions \ncontained within a proposed work- out agreement.

As shown in Exhibit 10- 4, these servicing actions may be divided into two broad \ncategories:  changes in project operations and changes to the loan account.  This section \ndescribes other servicing actions, most of which are less extreme.  \nA.  Servicing Actions to Change Project Operations  \nThe borrower may propose one or more servicing actions that will produce a change \nin project operations.  Some of these actions are discussed in detail in other sections. \nExhibit 10 -4 \nSpecial Servicing Actions That May Be Part  \nof an Approved Work -out Agreement  \nChanges in Project Operations  \n\u2022 Rent changes and/or preparation of a \nnew budget  \n\u2022 Occupancy waivers  \n\u2022 Temporary incentives to improve \noccupancy  \n\u2022 Special note rents (SNRs)  \n\u2022 Changing management agent or \nmanagement plan  \n\u2022 Changing project designation \n\u2022 Transfer of ownership  \n\u2022 Substitution of partners  Changes to the Loan Account  \n\u2022 Loan reamortizations  \n\u2022 Loan adjustments (writedowns)  \n\u2022 Loan consolidation  \n\u2022 Deferral of payments  \n\u2022 Prepayment/compromise offer  \n\u2022 Providing rental assistance (if available)  \n\u2022 Recasting the entire loan (i.e., \u201cstarting \nfresh\u201d)  \n \n \n1.  Rent Changes or Preparation of a New Budget  \nTo achieve financial stability, the borrower may propose a new budget that shows a \nchange in rents or operation costs.  In evaluating the request, it may be appropriate for the \nAgency to analyze the current market in which the project is located to see whether the \nproject rents compare favorably with rents for similar properties in the market.  Rent \nincentives will be allowed as described in paragraph 10.25 A.3 of this section, but the \nchange and accompanying budget will be conditionally approved by the Agency subject to meeting the requirements in Agency regulations, see Chapter 7 of HB -2-3560.  If the  \n \n10-20 \n ",
  "page_317": "HB-3-3560  \nAgency receives comments from tenants that warrant a different decision from the one \nmade when the work-out agreement was conditionally approved, the Agency must inform the borrower of these discoveries and make any needed adjustments to the conditionally approved budget. \nIn reviewing these changes, the MFH Servicing official must evaluate both short- and \nlong-term budget projections so as to establish whether the project is likely to achieve its financial goals during the work-out period, and whether the project is likely to achieve and maintain financial viability in the lon g term.  The MFH Servicing official must \nevaluate whether projections show repayment ability after the work -out agreement \nobjectives are met based on realistic vacancy, rent rate, and/or reamortization assumption.  \nAny projected capital improvements shown in the budget must be accompanied by \nstatements that describe the work to be done, the estimated costs with supporting material, the projected time frame for completing the work, and the source of funds to be used for the improvements. \n2.  Occupancy Waivers \nWhen a project is experiencing high vacancies and eligible tenants are not available, \nthe borrower may request to temporarily solve the problem by renting to ineligible tenants.  Ineligible tenants might be individuals whose incomes or family sizes are above the maximum limits or who do not meet an occupancy requirement, such as an age limit. \nA request to rent to ineligible tenants may be approved by the MFH Servicing official \nbased on the following determinations: \n\u2022 There are no eligible persons on the waiting list;  \n\u2022 The borrower has made a diligent but unsuccessful effort to rent any vacant units to \nan eligible tenant; and  \n\u2022 The borrower will continue to seek eligible tenants and will submit the following to the MFH Servicing official ; \n\u25ca Form RD 3560-29; and  \n\u25ca A report of efforts made to locate eligible tenants.  \nThe borrower must agree to the following conditions: \n\u2022 The units may be rented to ineligible tenants for no more than one year, following which the lease must convert to a monthly lease.  A statement to this effect must be included in the lease;  \n\u2022 Tenants who are ineligible because their household income exceeds the maximum for the project will be charged the Agency -approved SNR, if applicable; and \n\u2022 Without Agency approval, management may assign a larger or smaller unit than the household needs if the household is otherwise eligible.  Tenants must agree to transfer \n10-21 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623 ",
  "page_318": "HB-3-3560  \nto a correctly sized unit when one becomes available and must pay all costs \nassociated with moving.  A statement to this effect must be included in the lease.  \n3.  Temporary Incentives to Improve Occupancy  \nThe borrower may request temporary incentives to improve project occupancy.  \nThese incentives may not exceed the life of the work -out agreement.  The Agency may \ngrant such incentives when project management has been acceptable and under the following condi tions:  \n\u2022 The project is encountering unacceptable vacancy levels.  \n\u2022 The incentives are short -term, modest, \nand consistent with program objectives.  \n\u2022 Recipients are given a clear understanding of the extents and limits of the incentives.  \n\u2022 The use of incentives is fully accounted \nfor on project budgets and annual \nreports.  \n\u2022 Occupancy incentives will be paid from the following sources:  \n\u25ca Non-project sources;  \n\u25ca Forgone return to owner; and \n\u25ca Project funds when it can be shown to be cost -effective, which means that the \nrevenues derived will outweigh the costs of providing the incentives. \n4.  Special Note Rents  \nThe borrower may request a SNR to reduce the note rate rent to attract tenants who \ncan afford to pay more than 30 percent of their incomes in rent and utilities but who will not pay the existing note rate rent.  This servicing action is discussed in detail in Section 6 of this chapter.  \n5.  Changing the Management Agent or Management Plan  \nWhere poor management is evidenced by a record of failing to comply with Agency \nrequirements, the borrower may elect to change management.  Where the Agency has notified the borrower of the need to change management, financial incentives under work -out agr eement provisions may not be approved until the borrower changes \nmanagement or  agrees to change management within a reasonable time frame.  \nTemporary Incentives  \nto Improve Occupancy  \n1. Security deposit reductions or waivers \nand extended security deposit \npayment period.  \n2. Reduced rents in the form of rebates, \ncoupons, or a temporary agreement.  \n3. Free rent.  \n4.

  "page_319": "HB-3-3560  \n6.  Changing the Project Designation \nWhen a market has changed such that the type of tenant who would qualify for the \nproject is no longer available and vacancies are resulting, the borrower may request a \nchange in project designation.  The Leadership Designee will consider such a change when the following information has been provided: \n\u2022 The complete borrower case files will be submitted together with the MFH Servicing \nofficial \u2019s specific recommendations and analysis of the present and long- term \nsituation;  \n\u2022 Market feasibility documentation, which may include inquiry lists from the project or \nwaiting lists at other nearby and similar properties, which shows that other tenants are available to occupy the project.  Market feasibility documentation must also clea rly \nindicate that the present long- term marketability of the project is significantly \nchanged from the original market and  must include the appropriate demographic \ninformation that reflects the population trends in the area.  The market feasibility documentation must also show if the demand is for the bedroom-sized units in the project or if different sized units would be more desirable; \n\u2022 A summary of all servicing actions taken by the Agency to aid the borrower in maintaining the present designation; \n\u2022 A summary of all actions taken by the borrower to effectively market the units to \npotential eligible tenants; \n\u2022 A summary of the impact the change will have on any existing tenants, rent subsidy \nneeds, and the community as a whole; and \n\u2022 A summary of any needed or required physical modifications and analysis of cost feasibility to complete the modifications, including modification to unit sizes in terms of number of bedrooms. \n7.  Transfer of Ownership  \nIn some cases, the only means of addressing project concerns is through replacement \nof the borrower.  Some reasons that may require a transfer of ownership include: \n\u2022 Illness or death of a borrower; \n\u2022 Financial difficulties that cause a borrower to terminate his or her business operation; \nand \n\u2022 Fraudulent activity, as determined by the Office of the Inspector General (OIG). \nWhere work -out agreements call for a change in the borrower, the Agency may \ntemporarily approve financial concessions contingent upon the borrower agreeing to seek \na transfer of ownership.  The borrower must agree to provide evidence that ownership \n10-23 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623 ",
  "page_320": "HB-3-3560  \nreplacement is being actively pursued.  Should ownership replacement not be achieved \nwithin an agreed -upon time frame, liquidation of the account may be appropriate.  \nWhen a transfer occurs as a result of noncompliance, the transferee (new borrower) \nmust provide a plan for bringing the project into compliance as part of the application package.  For example, the loan payments and reserve account may be behind schedule.  \nThe transferee provides a plan that identifies the source of funds to meet these conditions. \nChapter 7 provides the details on approving and processing transfers of ownership. \n8.  Substitution of Partners  \nThe borrower may request a substitution of general partners as a way to inject new \nresources into the borrower entity.  Chapter 5 provides the details on approving and \nprocessing substitution of partners.  \nB.  Changes to the Loan Account  \nProposed servicing actions may require changes to the loan account such as those that \nare described in Chapter 11. \n1.  Deferral of Payments  \nDeferring any debt payment to the Agency is an extreme measure that should be used \nas a last resort.  Deferring a portion of the Agency debt and using this deferred amount to build up reserve funds may only be approved when the funds are being used to pay identified critical project needs.  For example, when a roof must be replaced within the next two years, the work- out agreement may call for deferring payments in an amount \nequal to the cost of replacing the roof and this amount will be deposited into the reserve account.  The critical need must be identified and closely monitored to ensure compliance.  \nDeferral of payment by the Agency should usually be accompanied by a borrower \ncontribution of financial resources to the project.  \nDeferring debt payments should not exceed two years.  National Office  concurrence \nmust be obtained when borrowers are requesting reduced or zero loan payments . \n2.  Change of Payments  \nScheduling loan payment in accordance with the borrower\u2019s repayment ability.  The \nprovisions must be documented.  The issuance of Form RD 3560- 29A, Multiple Family \nHousing Statement of Payment Due , will normally be suppressed during the period in \nwhich a work -out agreement calling for less than the normal full scheduled installment is \neffective.  To suppress issuance of Form RD 3560 -29A, process by using the appropriate \nscreen on the Automated Multi -Family Housing Accounting System (AMAS); see the \nAMAS manu al for specific instructions on how this is done.  Upon expiration of the \nwork -out agreement, a review will be conducted to determine any further servicing \nactions that may be appropriate (e.g., reamortizing, rescheduling, executing a new servicing plan and/or supplementary payment agreement that may call for higher than normal payments, preparing a problem case report, etc.).  As long as a borrower is \n10-24 ",

Prepayment  \nA borrower may offer to pay their loan in full, ahead of the scheduled loan repayment \ndate and exit the program.  In such an event, the project will no longer be a part of the \nMulti- Family Housing program, will no longer be subsidized by the Agency, and wi ll no \nlonger be subject to Agency regulations and procedures.

Voluntary Conveyance  \nVoluntary conveyance is a method of liquidation by which title to security is \ntransferred to the Federal Government.  The Leadership Designee is authorized to approve voluntary conveyance of property if the total indebtedness, including prior and junior liens, does not exceed their approval authority.  Chapter 12 provides the details on approving and processing an offer of voluntary conveyance.  \n5.  Provision of Rental Assistance  \nWhere there is servicing rental assistance available, the Leadership Designee may \nagree to provide rental assistance to a project as part of a work -out agreement in order to \nenable tenants who could otherwise not afford the rents to move into a project and improve vacancy.  \n10-25 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623 ",

If not, the MFH Servicing official  must work with the borrower to amend the agreement to incorporate \nservicing techniques that will achieve the desired goals or cancel the work -out agreement and \nmove to implement enforcement measures.  \nThe MFH Servicing official  will conduct the monitoring in the following ways:  \n\u2022 Reviewing the financial reports submitted by the borrower.  These include Form \nRD 3560- 7, which must be submitted on a quarterly basis and bank statements, if \nappropriate;  \n\u2022 Holding quarterly meetings at the project site with the borrower to track the progress \nof the work- out agreement; and \n\u2022 Conducting supervisory visits to monitor progress with an agreement.  Such visits are \nmandatory to determine if the work is being done when the work -out agreement \nincludes correcting deferred maintenance or when reserve funds are being used for repairs.  T hese supervisory visits should be held in conjunction with the quarterly \nmeetings with the borrower.  \n10.27   SUBSEQUENT SERVICING AND IMPACT ON FUTURE LOANS  \nAny member of a borrower entity with a controlling interest in a property in which there \nare serious noncompliance issues and no work -out agreement is in place, or where the entity is in \nnoncompliance with its work- out agreement, will not be eligible for f urther Agency loans.  In a \ncase such as this, the borrowers must make arrangements to restore compliance with Agency requirements and restore their financial viability.  \nIn cases where the borrower and the Agency work together to make an acceptable work -\nout agreement, the borrower may be eligible to receive additional assistance after they have been in compliance with the work- out agreement for six consecutive months.  In cases where work -\nout arrangements cannot be made, the primary basis for denying such assistance would be based on the borrowers' inability to meet eligibility requirements, shown by their track record of failing to meet existing requirements and responsibi lities for other projects.  \n10-26 \n ",

An SNR addresses the situation where some existing and prospective tenants a re not willing to pay \n30 percent of adjusted income or note rate rent because the rental rates would exceed those of other rental properties in the community.  This action may only be taken after supervisory efforts by the Agency and management efforts by the borrower have not produced an acceptable level of occupancy.  \n10.29   SNR ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS  \nA.  Required Project Conditions  \nThe borrower must document that the following conditions exist in the project for the \nMFH Servicing official  to consider allowing an SNR to be implemented:  \n\u2022 The project has been operational for at least 24 months (the borrower may request a waiver to this provision);   \n\u2022 No more than 10 percent of budgeted expenses are reflected as unrestricted cash on hand, and reserve account balances do not exceed the required accumulation- to-date \nminus authorized withdrawals;  \n\u2022 Over the most recent six -month period vacancy rates have averaged at least 15 \npercent or the project shows revenue losses of at least 15 percent;  \n\u2022 The loss of rents available is not a result of management\u2019s failure to effectively \nmarket the units; and  \n\u2022 Comparable rents in the area are lower than the previously approved note rate rents.  \nB.  Borrower Requirements  \nTo be eligible for the SNR, the borrower must:  \n\u2022 Be in compliance with Agency regulations and encourage occupancy through good \nmaintenance and positive relations with tenants;  \n\u2022 Sign a statement agreeing to forgo return to owner for the duration of the SNR;  \n\u2022 Submit a budget with only the minimal sufficient operation and maintenance expenses;  \n10-28 ",

  "page_329": "HB-3-3560  \n CHAPTER 11:  LOAN RESTRUCTURING  \n11.1   INTRODUCTION \nDuring the term of an Agency loan, borrowers may request Agency consent to restructure \nthe loan for their project that will simplify the operation of the project or help address financial \ndistress due to factors beyond the borrower\u2019s control.  One example is when a borrower requests that loans be restructured to reduce administrative burden, improve cost -effectiveness and \nefficiency, or more effectively  use the physical facilities common to projects.  Another example \nis a project experiencing negative cash flow due to increases in local taxes and utilities that are rising faster than area rents.  The methods used by the Agency to help accomplish the obje ctives \nstated above include loan agreement or loan resolution consolidation, loan consolidation, reamortization, and loan adjustments (writedowns ).  In addition to 7 CFR 3560 and the \ninstructions provided below, the requirements of Attachment A to Chapter 7, \"Transfer of Project Ownership\" should also be used.  \n This chapter describes the requirements for loan restructuring techniques and Agency \nprocedures for reviewing, approving and implementing such requests.  \nThis chapter describes the requirements for each of these loan restructuring techniques, \nand Agency procedures for reviewing, approving, and implementing such requests. \nSECTION 1:  ALLOWABLE TYPES OF RESTRUCTURING  \n11.2   OVERVIEW  \nAs mentioned above, the loan restructuring activities that the Agency may approve \ninclude the following:  \n\u2022 Loan agreement or loan resolution consolidation, which is an administrative action whereby the loan agreements, or loan resolutions, for multiple projects held by the same borrower are consolidated and assigned a single new project number.  The borrower still has separate loan notes and the Agency still  tracks each loan \nindividually, but all projects are administered by the Agency as if they were a single project;  \n\u2022 Loan consolidation, which is the consolidation of multiple loans for a single property into a single loan, with one note and one payment;  \n\u2022 Reamortization, which is a rescheduling of a borrower\u2019s debt; and  \n\u2022 Loan adjustments (writedowns),  which are reductions of the amount of the \nborrower\u2019s debt, allowing an otherwise sound project experiencing financial difficulties beyond its control to continue operating as a program property. \n11-1 \n(08-30-24)  PN  623 ",
  "page_330": "HB-3-3560  \n 11.3   LOAN AGREEMENT OR LOAN RESOLUTION CONSOLIDATION \nREQUIREMENTS [7 CFR 3560.410]  \nThe Agency may approve the consolidation of loan agreements or resolutions regardless \nof the total amount of debt being consolidated as long as the loan agreements being consolidated represent loans made for the same purpose, to the same borrower, with the  same plan of \noperation (e.g., nonprofit, limited profit, full profit).  The terms and the due date of the loans \ninvolved must not be altered, and other security instruments must remain unchanged and must \nnot be released.  \nUnder no circumstances will loan agreements or loan resolutions be consolidated if the \nAgency\u2019s security position will be adversely affected.  Any applicable restrictive -use provisions \nof the existing notes will continue to apply following consolidation. \n11.4   LOAN CONSOLIDATION REQUIREMENTS [7 CFR 3560.410]  \nThe Agency may approve loan consolidations under two circumstances:  \n\u2022 The loans are being transferred on new terms; or  \n\u2022 An initial and subsequent loan under one project number were closed on the same \ndate at the same rates and terms.  \nThe Agency may approve loan consolidations if, in addition to the above requirements, \nthe following conditions are met:  \n\u2022 Form RD 3560- 52, Promissory Note  and the loan agreements or resolutions will be \nconsolidated;  \n\u2022 Consolidation occurs on the Amortization Effective Date (AED) or as soon as \npossible after the AED is established; \n\u2022 All project accounts being consolidated will be current after the consolidation process, unless otherwise authorized by the Administrator; and \n\u2022 The Agency\u2019s security position will not be adversely affected.  \n11.5   REAMORTIZATION REQUIREMENTS [7 CFR 3560.455 ( b)] \nThe Agency may approve the reamortization of any Agency multi -family housing loan \naccount, although it will not reamortize accounts solely to remove a delinquency.  \nThe Agency may reamortize accounts when doing so is in the best interest of the \nGovernment and when needed to improve the financial viability of the property and project \noperations.  The Agency will not approve a loan reamortization if the reamortization w ill \nadversely affect the Government lien priority.  \n11-2 \n  ",
  "page_331": "HB-3-3560  \n 11.6   LOAN ADJUSTMENT (WRITEDOWN) REQUIREMENTS [7 CFR 3560.455( c)] \nBorrower requests for loan writedowns must be part of an approved workout agreement \nwith the Agency and be in the best interest of the Government.  Writedowns are permitted with \nexisting borrowers or transferees where: \n\u2022 The causes are beyond the borrower\u2019s control\u2014such as market weaknesses, unforeseen site problems, or natural disasters; and  \n\u2022 Sound management is evident or unsound management practices can be resolved by the removal of the responsible individuals in accordance with an approved work-out agreement with the Agency.  \nSECTION 2:  LOAN AGREEMENT OR  \nLOAN RESOLUTION/LOAN CONSOLIDATION  \n11.7   OVERVIEW  \nLoan agreement or loan resolution consolidation offers several advantages.  For instance, \nfollowing loan agreement or loan resolution consolidation, all reporting, accounting, and project management requirements for the various projects being consolidated are fulfilled as a single project.  In other words, borrowers need to maintain only one set of books and one operating budget, and can track all rents as a single project.  In addition, because rental assistance agreements are not consolidated, borrowers can apply rental assistance across projects following consolidation. That is, waiting lists for the projects being consolidated will be combined and \nrental assistance can be assigned to eligible tenants in the newly formed \u201cproject\u201d per assignment \npriorities.  \nLoan consolidation also offers several advantages.  For instance, when consolidating a \nloan under new rates and terms in conjunction with a transfer, borrowers can combine notes and cost items.  In addition, different portions of the property that may have been financed with separate loans can still be set up as distinct projects, but the borrower need track only one loan and one note. \nLeadership Designees may approve project or loan consolidations with the advice of the \nOffice of General Counsel (OGC) and when all required conditions outlined in this chapter are met. \n11.8   BORROWER SUBMISSIONS  \nA.  Loan Agreement or Loan Resolution Consolidation \nA borrower requests a loan agreement or loan resolution consolidation by submitting \nthe following forms to the appropriate MFH Servicing official : \n\u2022 Form RD 3560-33A , Consolidated Loan Agreement;  \n\u2022 Form RD 3560-34A, Consolidated RRH Loan Agreement;  \n \n11-3 \n(08-30-24)  PN  623 ",

Loan Consolidation  \nFor loan consolidations, borrowers must execute a new Form RD 3560- 9 for the new \nconsolidated Form RD 3560- 52, and submit it to the MFH Servicing official . The interest \ncredit plan originally established for the project applies to the consolidated note.

Obtain OGC Guidance  \nOGC guidance is required to accomplish loan agreement or loan resolution \nconsolidations.  Under no circumstances will the Agency consolidate projects if the security position of the Agency will be adversely affected.  If required by OGC, all of the loan ag reements or loan resolutions being consolidated may be secured by one deed of \ntrust or mortgage describing all of the loans for the projects.  \n4.  Maintain Loan Terms and Due Date  \nThe Agency alters neither the terms nor the due date of the loan(s) involved.  Other \nsecurity instruments also remain unchanged, and are not released following the consolidation. \n11-4 \n  ",

In addition, direct loans cannot be consolidated with interest credit loans, and loans with HUD Section 8 subsidy cannot be consolidated with insured loans.

The new schedule is usually developed to enable the \nborrower to continue the objectives of the loan.  \nLeadership Designee s may approve the reamortization of Agency loans within their \napproval authority for the type of loan involved.  Reamortization will not subject the borrower to any additional restrictive -use provisions beyond those associated with the original loan.  For \nexample, if there were 10 years of restrictive use remaining on a loan prior to a reamortization, there would still be 10 years remaining following the action.  If the original loan contained no restrictive -use provisions, the reamortiza tion would not add new use restrictions.  \n11.11   ACCEPTABLE USES OF REAMORTIZATIONS  \nA.  Allowable Conditions for Reamortizations  \nThe Agency may consider approving a reamortization if any of the following four \nconditions are met:  \n1.  Preventive Measure for a Borrower Likely to Experience Delinquency  \nThe Leadership Designee  determines that the borrower and tenants cannot reasonably \nbe expected to continue to meet their obligations unless the account is reamortized to reduce substantially the installments and rental rates.  \n2.  Corrective Measure to Help Delinquent Borrower Attain Successful Operation  \nThe borrower has a substantial delinquency that cannot be cured within one year.  In \naddition, the borrower must have acted in good faith and maintained compliance with all applicable Agency policies and procedures.  \n3.  Incentive to a Borrower Requesting Prepayment  \nThe borrower has received an equity loan as an incentive to avert prepayment, or a \nsubsequent loan has been made to a nonprofit corporation or public agency to purchase a project to avert prepayment. \n4.  Measure to Improve Project Operations  \nThe borrower is not delinquent or likely to become delinquent, but proposes the \nreamortization to improve project operations.

Complete Reamortization Agreement  \nMFH Servicing official s will complete Form RD 3560- 16 according to the FMI.  The \neffective date and the due date for all payments will be the first of the month, except for labor housing loans, whose due date will be established in accordance with the FMI.

Establish End of the Reamortization Period  \nThe reamortization period will end on the final due date of the note being \nreamortized, unless the term is extended with the advice and guidance of OGC and the \nAgency\u2019s lien position is not altered.  Any extension of the final due date should not exceed th e lesser of the remaining useful life of the security property or the maximum \nterm granted by the respective loan program authorizations. \nThe Agency may amortize the loan over a period not to exceed the remaining \neconomic life of the project or 50 years, whichever is less.  The Agency may extend the term of the loan to a period not to exceed 30 years or the remaining economic life of the project, whichever is less.  \nD.  Establish Interest Rate  \nThe interest rate charged by the Agency will be either the existing note rate, or the \ncurrent rate at the time the reamortization request Form RD 3560- 15 is approved or \nclosed, whichever is less.  \nE.  Address Delinquent Reserve Accounts  \nThe Agency may use reamortizations to address reserve accounts that are not at \nauthorized levels, as long as the shortfall is not due to the borrower\u2019s improper or unauthorized use of reserve funds.  MFH Servicing officials should take the following steps to address delinquent reserve accounts:  \n1.  Modify the Loan Agreement or Resolution  \nThe MFH Servicing official  should modify the loan agreement or resolution, or \nexecute a new agreement or resolution, that bases the new fully funded amount (i.e., 10 percent of the indebtedness) and annual reserve requirement (i.e., one -tenth of the fully \nfunded amount) on the amount of the reamortization, rather than on the original amount of indebtedness.  \n2.  Establish Reserve Requirements  \nThe MFH Servicing official  may establish reserve requirements at a higher level than \nthe amount required for the reamortization to allow for capital expenditures that have been identified and quantified, as long as the budget will support a higher level.  \n3.  Begin the Reserve Account with a New Base \nSince the fully funded amount and annual requirement are reestablished based on the \namount of the reamortization, the reserve account will begin with a new base.

Allow the Borrower to Receive a Return on Investment  \nWhen a newly established fully funded amount and annual requirement are based on \nthe reamortization amount, the MFH Servicing official  may allow the borrower to receive \na return on investment if all other applicable conditions for receiving a return have been met. \nF.  Obtain OGC Guidance As Needed \nMFH Servicing official s may obtain OGC guidance in the review of documents for \nlegal sufficiency.

Execute New Interest Credit Agreement  \nIf the borrower is to receive interest credit benefits following the reamortization of \nthe account, MFH Servicing official s will cancel the current interest credit agreement and \nprepare a new Form RD 3560- 9. \nH.  Close the Reamortization  \nThe Agency always closes reamortizations on the first day of the month.  Unpaid \ninterest to the date of closing may be capitalized.  \nI.  Meet Other Procedural Requirements  \nIn addition, MFH Servicing official s need to ensure that the following procedural \nrequirements are met:  \n\u2022 All reamortized loans must be closed on Predetermined Amortization Schedule \nSystem (PASS).  All initial and subsequent loans must convert to PASS in connection with the reamortization; \n\u2022 When recoverable cost items are involved, they are first capitalized by adding them to the principal loan balance outstanding on the oldest loan and then the entire indebtedness (principal plus outstanding interest, overage, and late fees) is reamortized;  \n\u2022 Include d eferred principal and deferred interest  (AMAS M1XI screen)  in the \nreamortization ; and  \n\u2022 Audit receivables and late fees may be reamortized.  \n__________________________________________________________________________________________  \n11-13 \n(08-30-24)  PN  623 ",

Writedowns should occur \nonly when the value of the property is less than the outstanding Agency debt. \nGenerally, writedowns will occur simultaneously with a transfer and assumption for less \nthan the total amount of outstanding debt.  However, the Agency may write down debts and continue the account with the same borrower if doing so is in the best interest  of the Agency, the \nproperty, and tenants. \nIn all cases, writedowns must be part of an approved work- out plan with the Agency, in \nthe Government\u2019s best interest, and designed to correct circumstances beyond the borrower\u2019s control.  Writedowns require approval by the Leadership Designee .  The Agency should consider \nthe project\u2019s suitability in accordance with Chapter 6 before approving a writedown.  \nBorrower equity in the project following the writedown will be no less than five percent \nof the amended loan balance for limited for -profit owners.  The borrower may realize the eight \npercent return on investment on a maximum of five percent equity, if applicable.  A reduced return may be authorized on amounts of equity contributed greater than five percent.  Nonprofit and public agency borrowers may enter into workouts that propose loan- to-value ratios of 100 \npercent.  \n11.17   ALLOWABLE USES  \nWritedowns may only be approved when the conditions leading to a default were beyond \nthe borrower\u2019s control and management is generally sound. Writedowns are used to address severe financial difficulties with a project and the Agency will consider all avai lable servicing \noptions before approving a writedown. Some examples of circumstances where a writedown might be an acceptable servicing solution include:  \n\u2022 Sustained market weaknesses in the property\u2019s community or region;  \n\u2022 Unforeseen site problems; or  \n\u2022  A natural disaster results in significant damage to the property.  \n11.18   BORROWER SUBMISSIONS  \nBorrowers requesting writedowns must submit the following documents to the MFH \nServicing official : \n\u2022 Form RD 3560- 15; and  \n11-15 \n(08-30-24)  PN  623 ",

However, if it is clear that a \nborrower cannot continue with the loan, the MFH  Servicing official  should analyze the \nfeasibility of liquidation options and recommend the option that is in the Government\u2019s best interest, defined as the option that will result in the greatest net recovery.  \nSection 1 of this chapter describes how the Agency determines whether or not to \nliquidate, and if so, which of the available options would be least costly for the Government.  This section provides a brief catalogue of liquidation options, a discussion of net recovery value and basic security loss, and an outline of how decisions to liquidate are ultimately made. \nSection 2 of the chapter contains information on liquidation procedures for voluntary \nliquidation and foreclosure.  A discussion about the acquisition of chattel property is also included.  Section 3 discusses debt settlement. \nSECTION 1: MAKING THE DECISION TO LIQUIDATE  \n12.2   AN OVERVIEW OF LIQUIDATION OPTIONS  \nWhen the Agency determines that liquidation is appropriate, it may accelerate the loan.  \nThe borrower must pay the full account balance and meet the other terms of the loan within the prescribed time frame, or the Agency may initiate foreclosure proceedings.  Once the loan has been accelerated, the Agency will not accept partial payment unless required to do so by State law. \nA. Voluntary Liquidation\n1.  Voluntary Sale \nSale of the security property is generally the most desirable option for both the\nAgency and a borrower who is unable to continue the loan.  For the Agency, a sale to another party avoids the costs of foreclosure, as well as the costs related to owning and disposing of a property.  For the borrower, it offers the best opportunity for being released from the debt without a major credit history blemish.  A borrower may sell the property to a third party even after the account is accelerated.  \nIf the borrower sells or transfers title of a security property on which the loan has \nbeen accelerated, the Agency requires payment in full to release any Agency liens or to \n__________________________________________________________________________________________  \n12-1\n(08-30-24)  PN  623 ",
  "page_346": "HB-3-3560  \n stop foreclosure action.  However, to facilitate a sale after acceleration, the Agency may \nagree to release Agency liens in return for payment of the estimated net recovery value.  \n2.  Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure \nAfter the account has been accelerated, the borrower can offer to convey the security \nproperty to the Agency.  The Agency will accept the deed in lieu of foreclosure only if the Agency will realize a greater net recovery value than would be obtained if for eclosure \nproceedings continued.   \n3.  Assignment to Junior Lien Holder  \nThe Agency may assign the note and mortgage to a junior lien holder, if such a lien \nholder makes an offer for the property in the amount of at least the net recovery value, and all appeal rights have expired.  \nB.  Foreclosure  \n1.  Agency Foreclosure  \nWhen all reasonable efforts have failed to encourage the borrower to voluntarily \nliquidate the loan through sale of the property, deed in lieu of foreclosure, or by entering into an accelerated repayment agreement, the Agency may initiate foreclosure proce edings.  \n2.  Foreclosure by a Another Lien Holder \nIf there is a prior lien holder, the Agency must determine if the prior lien holder \nshould have the opportunity to foreclose.  Foreclosure by a prior lien holder may be a less costly alternative to Agency foreclosure.  If the Agency intends to foreclose in cases in which there is a prior lien, the Agency must decide either to settle the lien or foreclose subject to the lien.  \nC.  Acquisition of Chattel Property  \nThe Agency will make determinations regarding disposition of chattel property that \nare in the best interest of the government.  The Agency will make every effort to avoid acquiring chattel property by having the borrower or MFH Servicing official  liquidate the \nproperty.  \n12.3   NET RECOVERY VALUE  \nEstimated net recovery value represents the amount that the Agency could expect to \nrecover from a property if it was liquidated after considering all costs associated with liquidating, holding, and selling the property.  Attachment 12 -A contains a net recovery value worksheet to \naid in this calculation.  Actual net recovery value is the amount the Agency does in fact recover from the sale of a property, after accounting for all costs. \n12-2 \n  ",
  "page_347": "HB-3-3560  \n The following sections provide guidance in estimating net recovery value.  \nA.  Establishing Market Value  \nThe market value of the property is the fundamental basis for establishing the \nestimated net recovery value.  All calculations undertaken on the net recovery value \nworksheet provide additions or deductions from market value.  \nDepending upon the likely method of liquidation and at what point in the process the \ncalculation is being made, market value may be based on an estimated value, on an appraisal or on the actual sale price.  Early in the process of determining which liquida tion method should be followed, the MFH  Servicing official  may need to make a \nrough estimate of the market value based on any available information.  \nB.  Environmental Considerations  \nThe MFH  Servicing official \u2019s estimate of market value must take into consideration \npotential environmental hazards that may pose a liability issue for the Agency, and the presence of environmental resources for which the Agency will have an affirmative responsibility to take protectiv e measures once it owns the property.  Exhibit 12- 1 \nprovides a partial list of environmental factors for consideration.  \nTo minimize Agency liability, the Agency must ensure, prior to acquiring property \nthrough foreclosure, that the property has been examined for potential contamination from hazardous substances, hazardous wastes, and petroleum  products, including \nunderground storage tanks.  This should be accomplished by requesting that MFH \nServicing official  complete the ASTM Standard E -1528 Transaction Screen \nQuestionnaire, (TSQ) .  If the completed form raises any concerns it should be submitted \nto the Environmental Staff  for further evaluation and guidance.  \nThe Agency also should examine the property prior to acquisition and consider any \ncosts associated with environmental resources the Agency might be required to protect. \nFor additional information, see RD Instruction 1940- G. \n12-3 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623 ",

Ordering an Appraisal  \nGuidance about ordering appraisals is presented in Chapter 4 of HB -1-3560.  The \npoint at which a formal appraisal is actually conducted will vary.  \n1.  Valueless Lien  \nIf the MFH  Servicing official \u2019s estimate suggests that the lien may be valueless, an \nappraisal should be obtained immediately.  If the appraisal indicates that the lien is in fact \nvalueless, it should be released without incurring servicing costs.  \n2.  Deed in Lieu of Foreclosure \nIf, after acceleration, the borrower offers a deed in lieu of foreclosure, an appraisal \nshould be obtained immediately so the MFH  Servicing official  can determine whether it \nis in the government\u2019s interest to accept the deed.  \n3.  Foreclosure  \nIf the property will be going to foreclosure, no appraisal should be obtained until \nshortly before the sale is scheduled to take place.  In areas where the foreclosure process can be lengthy, the value of the property could change before the sale if the appraisal is conducted too far in advance.   \n12-4 \n  ",
  "page_349": "HB-3-3560  \n D.  Holding Period  \nNearly all costs and income used in the net recovery value calculation are affected by \nthe holding period.  For estimated net recovery value, the length of the holding period is \nestimated differently, depending on the likely method of disposition.  The hol ding period \nshould be estimated as the time between the date the net recovery worksheet is being \nfilled out and the anticipated date for:  \n\u2022 Filing of the deed and the expiration of redemption rights (foreclosure);  \n\u2022 Filing the warranty deed (deed in lieu of foreclosure);  \n\u2022 Filing the release (release of valueless lien); or  \n\u2022 Payoff and release (debt settlement offer subsequent to acceleration).  \nThe time for marketing and disposition, if the property is acquired, should also be \nconsidered when estimating the holding period. \nE.  Deductions from Market Value  \nNumerous costs associated with liquidation must be considered when determining the \nnet recovery value, including the following costs. \n\u2022 Prior liens to be paid by the Agency .  In a case where a prior lien is involved, the \namount required to repay the prior lien holder must be included in the calculation;  \n\u2022 Junior liens to be paid by the Agency .  If the Agency pursues foreclosure, junior \nliens are not paid.  However, in the case of a deed in lieu of foreclosure, it may be to \nthe Agency\u2019s advantage to pay off a junior lien holder. The agency should conduct a title search to identify the position and the amount of each lien against the property;  \n\u2022 Selling expenses to be paid by the Agency .  All transaction costs involved in selling \nthe property, including advertising, commissions for selling agents, required seller certifications, surveys, points, and closing costs paid by the Agency, whether on behalf of the borrower in a voluntary liquidation, or as an Agency expense for a real estate owned (REO) sale;  \n\u2022 Holding costs .  During the time that the Agency owns the property, the monthly \ninterest accrued is multiplied by the number of months in the holding period;  \n\u2022 Depreciation during the holding period.  The property may depreciate in value while it is being held by the Agency;  \n\u2022 Administrative costs .  The administrative burden associated with holding a property \nincludes the cost of liquidation, such as attorney fees, filing, recordation, advertising, and document service fees, that are customarily incurred in a foreclosure action; and \n12-5 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623 ",

During the period the Agency holds the property it will accrue \ncosts related to cleaning, securing, and maintaining the property such as utilities and \nreal estate taxes.  \nF.  Additions to Market Value  \nAlthough most of the adjustments to market value involve deductions to reduce the \nrecovery amount, there are a few factors that can increase the market value.  \n\u2022 Appreciation during the holding period.  In markets that are strong, the property may appreciate while it is being held by the Agency; and  \n\u2022 Income during the holding period.  In general, the Agency does not lease properties.  However, REO properties may be leased in limited circumstances, such as a property located in an area where keeping the property occupied could greatly reduce vandalism, or if there are tenants living i n the property whom the Agency does \nnot wish to displace. \n12.4   BASIC SECURITY LOSS  \nThe basic security loss is the difference between the property\u2019s market value and the \noutstanding Agency debt on the property, including principal, and other recoverable costs.   \nIt is important for the MFH  Servicing official  to consider the basic security loss in \ndetermining how to work with the borrower.  For example, the debt settlement arrangements the Agency agrees to might be more lenient in the case of a borrower with a property that lost value \nthrough no fault of the borrower.  This information can be used for portfolio analysis to help the Agency originate loans more effectively in the future. \n12.5   ACCOUNT LIQUIDATION A.  Making the Decision to Liquidate  \nIn all liquidation cases, the Leadership Designee will be responsible for the final \ndecision to liquidate the borrower\u2019s account based on advice and counsel from the Office \nof General Counsel (OGC) and the following information supplied by the MFH  Servicing \nofficial : \n\u2022 An opinion by the MFH  Servicing official  about whether the borrower is forcing an \nacceleration to circumvent the prepayment process;  \n\u2022 The specific recommendations of the MFH  Servicing official  on the method of \ncarrying out the liquidation;  \n\u2022 The case file and any other pertinent information developed in support of the accusations;  \n\u2022 A summary of Agency efforts to work out an acceptable solution short of liquidation;  \n12-6 \n  ",

If the Agency determines that the borrower has taken action to bring about  the acceleration in an effort to avoid the prepaym ent \nprocess, the Agency will consider alternatives to acceleration, such as suing for specific performance under the loan and management documents.  \nB.  Possible Outcomes of Agency\u2019s Decision to Liquidate  \nIf the Agency decides to liquidate, there are several possible outcomes, which are as \nfollows:  \n\u2022 The borrower may cure the default by developing and submit to the Agency for approval a workout agreement that proposes actions to be taken over a period of time to prevent or correct a default;  \n\u2022 The borrower can voluntarily convey the property to the Agency;  \n\u2022 Transfer (sale or transfer and assumption of mortgage);  \n\u2022 Foreclosure;  \n\u2022 Payoff with use restriction; or  \n\u2022 Debt settlement (cash only) for minimum bid or greater.\n12-7 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623 ",

Any recommendation should result in the greatest net \nrecovery to the Government.   \nThe borrower may liquidate voluntarily, either through sale of the property or deed in lieu \nof foreclosure.  If it determined that the borrower\u2019s account must be liquidated, the Agency may recommend foreclosure and accelerate the loan.  \n12.7   VOLUNTARY CONVEYANCE  \nAfter acceleration, borrowers may voluntarily liquidate through deed in lieu of \nforeclosure or an offer by a junior lien holder.  In the case of voluntary liquidation, the borrower is responsible for all expenses associated with liquidation and acquisition.  The Agency will only consider acceptance of an offer of voluntary conveyance if it is likely to receive a recovery on its investment.  The Agency will not accept a voluntary conveyance offer if it is not in the Government\u2019s best interest to do so.  The Agency should refuse the voluntary conveyance if the Agency lien has neither present nor prospective value or recovery of the value would be unlikely or uneconomical.  \nVoluntary sale of the security property may be the least onerous option for the borrower \nand the least costly option for the Government.  If there is an interested buyer, procedures for property transfer that should be followed are described in Chapter 7 of this handbook. \nA.  Payment of Liens  \nIf the Agency accepts a deed in lieu of foreclosure, it will pay prior liens if the \nGovernment\u2019s investment and payment of the lien may be recovered.  The Agency will accept conveyance subject to prior liens if the lien holder does not object.  In this cas e, \nthe Agency will make installment payments on the lien.   \nJunior liens must be paid by the borrower.  If the borrower does not agree to pay these \nobligations, the Government will do so if it is in its best interest in the long run.  The Leadership Designee  determines whether the Agency will settle junior liens.  \nB.  Required Components of an Offer of Voluntary Conveyance  \nAn offer of voluntary conveyance will consist of the following documentation:  \n\u2022 Form RD 3560- 22, Offer to Convey Security;  \n\u2022 Warranty Deed, which will be recorded only when the voluntary conveyance is accepted;  \n\u2022 Updated t itle policy  and environmental review s including ASTM Standard E -\n1528 Transaction Screen Questionnaire, (TSQ) ; \n12-9 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623 ",

When the market value of the property is less than the Agency debt, the Agency must consider the borrower\u2019s current situation and future prospects for paying this debt. \nItems to be included in the borrower\u2019s case file are shown in Exhibit 12- 2. \nExhibit 12 -2 \nLiquidation Option - Borrower\u2019s Case File  \n\u2022 Report on Multi -family Housing Problem Case;  \n\u2022 Liquidation and management plan;  \n\u2022 Form RD 3560 -22; \n\u2022 Resolution authorizing conveyance, if applicable;  \n\u2022 Current title search;  \n\u2022 Environmental review;  \n\u2022 Form  RD 3560 -7; \n\u2022 Form  RD 3560 -10; \n\u2022 Current appraisal prepared by a qualified appraiser;  \n\u2022 Due diligence report;  \n\u2022 Balance of Rural Development account and other liens, if any;  \n\u2022 Assignment of HAP contracts, if applicable;  \n\u2022 Current statement of account from the St. Louis Office;  \n\u2022 Development plan with breakdown of costs, if applicable; and  \n\u2022 Form RD 402-2, Statement of Deposits and Withdrawals,  if applicable.  \n12-10 \n  ",

Closing of Conveyance \nClosing of conveyance will be complete when the recorded deed has been returned to \nthe Agency with no outstanding encumbrances other than Agency liens and/or previously \napproved prior liens.  Costs incurred prior to the completion of the transaction will be charged to the borrower as recoverable costs.  \nUpon closing of the transaction, if applicable, the MFH  Servicing official  will release \nliens and inform the borrower of the release from liability.  Borrowers must be notified whether or not they have been released from liability. \nThe Leadership Designee  will cancel any interest credit and suspend any rental \nassistance.  Tenants must be informed of the possible consequences of liquidation.  If the property will no longer participate in the Section 515, 514/516, or 521 programs, the tenants must be given a minimum of 180 days\u2019 written notice.  \n12.8   FORECLOSURE  \nState laws pertaining to acceleration and foreclosure will affect the procedures the \nAgency is required to follow.  OGC should be consulted to ensure that appropriate procedures are followed.  \nA.  Making the Acceleration Decision  \nThe Agency must decide whether to accelerate the account and begin the foreclosure \nprocess.  The decision to accelerate involves numerous considerations, many of which will vary case by case.  The following issues should always be considered. \n1.  OGC Concurrence  \nAdvice and counsel should be obtained from OGC before beginning the foreclosure \nprocess if:  \n\u2022 The foreclosure is based on a nonmonetary default; or \n\u2022 The property also serves as security for a loan under another USDA program, such as the FSA, since this may trigger liquidation of the other loan.  \n2.  Tribal Land \nIf the security property is on tribal-allotted or trust land, the acceleration may be \napproved only after the Agency has offered, in writing, to transfer the account to an eligible tribal member, the tribe, and the Indian Housing Authority serving the tribe or tribes.  \n12-11 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623 ",
  "page_356": "HB-3-3560  \n 3.  Role of Other Lien Holders  \nDepending upon the status of other liens on the security property, the Agency may \ninvite other lien holders to join in the foreclosure action, or join in a foreclosure action \ninitiated by another lien holder. \nB.  Acceleration  \n1.  Acceleration Notice  \nIf the Agency determines that the appropriate approach to liquidation is foreclosure, \nthe process begins with an acceleration notice ( Guide Letter 1955- A-1, Notice of \nAcceleration to MFH Borrowers Liable for the Debt (Excludes Borrowers Who Were \nDischarged in Bankruptcy ) or Guide Letter 1955 -A-2, Notice of Acceleration to MFH \nBorrowers Discharged in Bankruptcy Who Have Not Reaffirmed the Debt ).  The \nacceleration notice demands full payment of the account, including unpaid principal and interest, advances, and subsidy subject to recapture.  It notifies the borrower of: (1) the reason for the acceleration, (2) the amount due, (3) the method of payment, (4) the opportunity for an informal review with the decision maker to seek mediation or alternative dispute r esolution or to request an administrative appeal hearing, (5) and \nprepayment restrictions.  The notice gives the borrower 30 days  to pay in full or request a \nhearing.  \nThe acceleration notice must also include language regarding prepayment restrictions. \nIf a borrower prepays an Agency loan made before December 21, 1979, the tenants must be given 180 days\u2019  notice that the project can be removed from the program.  For \ninformation on these loans, see Chapter 15.  \nThe notice must be sent to the borrower and any cosigners simultaneously by both \nregular mail and certified mail, return receipt requested.  If the property address is different from the address of the borrower, the notice should be sent to the property address as well.  \n 2.  Payment Subsidy  \nIf a borrower is receiving payment subsidy, the payment subsidy agreement will not \nbe canceled when the debt is accelerated, but it will not be renewed unless the account is reinstated.  \n3.  Offers to Pay  \nThe decision to accelerate the account must not be made until the MFH  Servicing \nofficial  has made all reasonable efforts to help the borrower become successful.  \nTherefore, once the account has been accelerated, borrower efforts to cure the default will not be accepted unless required by state law.  If state law requires that foreclosure actio ns \nbe halted if an account is brought current, partial payment of the accelerated amount must be accepted.  Otherwise, any payment for less than the full amount required to close the account should be returned to the borrower.   \n12-12 ",

The Agency may grant the borrower additional time \nto voluntarily liquidate.  If an offer is deemed unacceptable, the Agency\u2019s denial is  not \nappealable.  \nC.  Review of the Acceleration Decision  \nSeveral remedies are available to borrowers who believe their accounts should not \nhave been accelerated.  These include an informal review, mediation or dispute resolution, and a formal appeal with the National Appeals Division (NAD) of the Department of A griculture.  Foreclosure actions will be held in abeyance while an appeal \nis pending. \nD.  Transfers and Subsequent Loans During Foreclosure  \nProperties can be transferred during the foreclosure process.  However, the \nforeclosure process should not be stopped until the applicant is determined eligible and \nthe transfer is determined to be feasible and in the best interest of the government.  For a discussion of how the value of a property is determined, see Chapter 7, Section 7.26. \nE.

If the Agency is the senior lien holder, it can only submit one bid.  If the Agency is not the senior lien holder, the designated bidder may make incremental bids in comp etition with other bidders. \nIf a project that is subject to restrictive -use provisions is sold outside the program at \nthe foreclosure sale, the Agency has no means to continue to enforce the restrictive -use \nprovisions after the purchase.  \nG.  After Foreclosure  \n1.  Agency Reporting \nAfter the property has been acquired, the MFH Servicing official  must furnish the \nLeadership Designee  with a report on the sale.  Two forms must be filed: MFH Advice of \nMortgaged Real Estate Acquired form , and, if applicable, Form RD 3560 -55. \n2.  The Property  \nUpon acquisition, any existing leases must be transferred, and management \nagreements must either be extended or canceled.  \n3.  The Borrower  \nIf the property is acquired by the Agency, the Agency must credit the borrower\u2019s \naccount with the Government\u2019s maximum bid.  If the property is not acquired by the Agency, the borrower\u2019s account must be handled in accordance with State law.   \nThe Agency must make attempts to collect any unsatisfied balances. When deficiency \njudgments are sought, the Leadership Designee must prepare Form RD 1962- 20, Notice \nof Judgment , which establishes how the account is to be handled by the MFH Servicing \nofficial . \n12.9   ACQUISITION OF CHATTEL PROPERTY  \nThe Agency will make every effort to avoid acquiring chattel property by having the \nborrower or MFH Servicing official  liquidate the property according to RD Instruction 1962- A, \nand applying the proceeds to the borrower\u2019s accounts.

There are \nfour types of debt settlement: compromise, adjustment, charge -off, and cancellation.  The \nAgency complies with the De bt Collection and Improvement Act of 1996 in pursuing \noutstanding debt.  However, a majority of MFH loans are to non -recourse borrowers for which \nno additional recovery is possible after liquidation.  Therefore, the Agency primarily uses debt settlement in  conjunction with voluntary liquidation. \nThe Leadership Designee  may approve or reject proposed debt settlements when the \noutstanding balance of the indebtedness amount in the offer is less than $1 million.

Most of these cases involve \ncharacteristics unique to either a particular property or to a particular borrower.  Property and borrower issues include a number of relatively uncommon, but nevertheless important, situations that MFH Servicing official s need to know how to address.  Property issues include \nabandonment, valueless liens, and other security issues.  Borrower i ssues include death, divorce, \nbankruptcy/insolvency, and membership liability agreements.  \nThis chapter presents the requirements for these other special servicing cases and Agency \nprocedures for addressing them. \nSECTION 1:  PROPERTY ISSUES  \n13.2   OVERVIEW OF PROPERTY ISSUES  \nThe Agency\u2019s servicing goal is to protect the physical and financial asset that each \nproject represents, and ensure that each project is operated in a way that meets program objectives.  Sometimes, a property becomes troubled due to mismanagement, deferred maintenance, or market changes.  As a result, the property may lose a significant share of its value.  Whether a borrower chooses to abandon the property or to continue with its management, the Agency needs to address the situation created by the property\u2019s problems with appropriate servicing measures that protect the interest of the tenants and the Government.  This section describes those measures.  \nIn general, MFH Servicing official s should obtain the advice of the Office of General \nCounsel (OGC) as needed for handling the special circumstances addressed in this section.  These circumstances include:  \n\u2022 Abandonment;  \n\u2022 Valueless liens;  \n\u2022 Other security issues; and  \n\u2022 Taking additional security to protect Agency interests. \nPrior to any decision involving real property under the above -listed special \ncircumstances, MFH Servicing official s will complete an environmental review (including an  \nASTM Standard E -1528 Transaction Screen Questionnaire, (TSQ) ) under The National \nEnvironmental Policy Act (NEPA), and a due diligence report.  Refer to 7 CFR part 1970 and Chapter 3, Section 3 of HB -1-3560 for further information. \n__________________________________________________________________________________________  \n13-1 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623 ",
  "page_369": "HB-3-3560  \n13.3   ABANDONMENT  \nWhen the Agency believes that a borrower has abandoned a project, it will make an \nimmediate check to determine if the borrower has moved and, if so, whether a forwarding \naddress can be determined so that further servicing actions can be taken.  The Agency will take \nthe steps necessary to protect the Government\u2019s security interest in the property.  In general, the \nsteps taken following abandonment are similar to those taken following foreclosure, once \nabandonment has been confirmed.  \nA.  Indicators of Abandonment  \nThe Agency considers a property to be abandoned when any or all of the following \nconditions exist:  \n\u2022 The borrower cannot be located after the MFH Servicing official  has made diligent \nefforts to contact the borrower.  This condition also applies to instances where the \ngeneral partner(s) of a limited partnership cannot be located and the limited partners are unknown or cannot be located.  \n\u2022 The project remains unoccupied for an extended period of time, and the borrower makes no effort to maintain the security property, secure eligible occupants, and/or comply with the objectives of the loan within a reasonable period of time as specified by the MFH Servicing official  in a certified letter sent to the borrower requesting \ncompliance.  \nB.  Contacting Prior Lien Holders  \nIf the property is not being maintained and the MFH Servicing official  determines \nthat the borrower has abandoned the project, the MFH Servicing official  will attempt to \ncontact any prior lien holders with a request that they take control of the property and make any emergency repairs necessary.  \nIf no prior lien holder is involved or the prior lien holder cannot immediately be \ncontacted or refuses to make the emergency repairs, the MFH Servicing official  will \nimmediately notify the Leadership Designee and request permission to:  \n\u2022 Take possession of the property pending liquidation;  \n\u2022 Make health and safety repairs to prevent further deterioration of the security; and  \n\u2022 Enter into a management or caretaker\u2019s agreement on behalf of the owner.  \nC.  Making Emergency Health and Safety Repairs  \nWhen making necessary health and safety repairs where an emergency exists, MFH \nServicing official s should recognize that the repairs need to be completed as quickly and \neffectively as possible.  Accordingly, a commonsense approach that balances the health and safety of tenants with the price, speed, and quality of the repairs should be employed.  \n__________________________________________________________________________________________  \n13-2 \n  ",
  "page_370": "HB-3-3560  \nBids for specific services may be obtained from several local contractors only if the bid \nprocess does not adversely affect the health and safety of the tenants.  MFH Servicing official s must document the circumstances leading to the emergency situation, as well as \nthe reasonable steps taken to address health and safety concerns in the case file, to later back up any costs incurred. \nAll costs incurred at the project during the interim period between abandonment and \neventual disposition by the Agency\u2014including repair costs \u2014are the responsibility of the \nborrower.  The Agency treats the costs of managing abandoned property as a recoverable cost item.  \nD.  Appointing a Caretaker or Management Agent  \nA caretaker or management agent will normally be appointed when the borrower has \nabandoned the security property or has failed to maintain its operation and the Leadership Designee determines, with the advice of OGC, that the Agency should take possession of the property to best protect the interest of the government.  Selection of a caretaker or management agent is subject to the following requirements: \n\u2022 Qualifications.   Persons or firms chosen as caretakers or management agents should \nhave experience in operating and managing similar properties or have business \nexperience that qualifies them to provide the needed services.  They must be located near the property to provide day -to-day supervision, or be able to appoint a qualified \nlocal person to meet this requirement.  Caretakers will normally be selected for unoccupied projects or those not suitable for occupancy.  Management agents will only be selected for projects that are occupied or suitable for occupancy.  The \nselection process \u2014which must comply with all applicable Federal Acquisition \nRegulation (FAR) requirements \u2014must be adequately documented by MFH Servicing \nofficial s in the case file.  \n\u2022 Allowable fees.   The amount of the management agent or caretaker fee must be set in \naccordance with Agency requirements for management fees.  The requirements regarding management fees are established at 7 CFR 3560.102(i) and described in Chapter 3 of HB -2-3560.  These f ees will be paid as a project expense if project funds \n(e.g., reserve accounts) are available.  If project funds are not available, fees will be paid with Government vouchers, considered a recoverable cost, and charged to the borrower\u2019s acco unt.  The fees will be paid on a monthly basis. \n\u2022 Rental rates.  Rental rates at abandoned properties will normally remain the same for \neligible occupants as when the project was under the control of the borrower, although revisions may be allowed under certain circumstances with the approval of the Leadership Designee .  Such conditions include:  \n\u25ca The lease agreement between the borrower and tenant permits changing the rates;  \n__________________________________________________________________________________________  \n13-3 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623 ",
  "page_371": "HB-3-3560  \n\u25ca A change of rates is needed to provide income sufficient to pay operational and \nmaintenance expenses, including the caretaker\u2019s fee, and to repay the loan on schedule; or  \n\u25ca Any increase will not result in rental rates above the payment ability of eligible occupants, unless the Leadership Designee  has given the authority to rent units to \nineligible occupants.  \n\u2022 OGC advice.   The Leadership Designee should consult OGC for advice, including \nthe possibility of having a receiver appointed, when the following conditions exist:  \n\u25ca The project is occupied but rent is not paid or collected;  \n\u25ca The eligibility of the occupants cannot be determined; and  \n\u25ca The borrower has failed to comply with the objectives of the loan within a reasonable time frame as specified by the MFH Servicing official  in a certified \nletter to the borrower requesting compliance.  \nE.  Addressing the Agency\u2019s Relationship with the Borrower  \nTo resolve the abandonment situation, the Agency must determine the cause of the \nabandonment.  If a property is abandoned in accordance with Section 13.3 A of this chapter, MFH Servicing official s need to document that the Agency will proceed with \none of three servicing options:  foreclosure, acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure, or debt settlement.  The Agency normally will proceed with foreclosure unless one of the \nother two options is of fered by the borrower.  If the Agency determines after \ninvest igating the causes for the abandonment that the borrower entity is no longer viable, \nit will normally proceed to foreclosure or accept a deed in lieu of foreclosure, if debt settlement cannot be achieved.  The Agency will consider negotiated debt settlemen t only \nin cases where a default is evident and doing so is in the best interest of the Government.  Properties in which debts are settled may be declared non -program properties. \nUpon foreclosure, the Agency has the authority to seize any project accounts on \nwhich the Agency has countersigned (e.g., reserve accounts).  \n13.4   VALUELESS LIENS  \nA valueless lien exists at a property where the recoverable value of the lien is less than \nthe estimated cost of recovery.  When the Agency determines that it has a valueless lien, it will prepare a written determination to that effect and release its lien . \nA.  Declaring a Valueless Lien  \nTo declare a valueless lien, the MFH Servicing official  must provide the following \nsubmissions to the Leadership Designee:  \n\u2022 Identification of property (legal description);  \n__________________________________________________________________________________________  \n13-4 \n  ",
  "page_372": "HB-3-3560  \n\u2022 Description of the Agency\u2019s lien position;  \n\u2022 Documentation of reasons that lien is determined to be without value; and  \n\u2022 Explanation of the reasons for releasing the lien and a description of the type of \nrelease sought (i.e., partial or full).  \nB.  Documenting Valueless Liens  \nTo document the reasons the lien on a project is determined to be valueless and to \ndevise a strategy for releasing the lien, MFH Servicing official s should take the following \nsteps:  \n\u2022 Within the context of a problem case report, write up an assessment of the value of the project and forward it to the Leadership Designee for review and guidance on how \nto release the lien; and  \n\u2022 Follow Leadership Designee\u2019s  instructions, as applicable.  \n13.5   OTHER SECURITY  \nThe Agency also services other security instruments, such as collateral assignments, \nassignments of rents, Housing Assistance Payments (HAP) contracts, and notices of lien holder interest in a manner indicated by the agreements and according to acceptable practices in the respective states.  When other security is taken, the Agency  should develop a plan for servicing it \nat the outset.  \n\u2022 The Leadership Designee  should develop any special servicing actions with the \nadvice of OGC to protect the Agency\u2019s interest.  \n\u2022 MFH Servicing official s should file evidence of the other security in the loan docket.   \n\u2022 The MFH Servicing official  should make a notation on the management system card \nshowing that the security has been retained.  \n13.6   OBTAINING ADDITIONAL SECURITY TO PROTECT AGENCY INTERESTS  \nThe Agency generally does not need additional security to protect its interest.  However, \nthe Agency may negotiate with the borrower to obtain additional security in the form of real estate or other security when a decline in the value of the original secu rity or other changes \nadversely affect the security available to the Agency in the event of a default.  Examples of cases where the Agency may seek additional security include when the account is delinquent, the property has not been properly managed or ma intained, or there is serious doubt that the \nborrower can carry out loan objectives.  \nWhile the Agency has the authority to seek additional security in the circumstances listed \nabove, it is generally a negotiated, nonforcible action.  However, there may be instances where the Agency can use its leverage to obtain additional security (e.g., a case where loan funds are \n__________________________________________________________________________________________  \n13-5 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623 ",
  "page_373": "HB-3-3560  \nused to purchase land on which the borrower plans to build a parking lot).  In such cases, the \nAgency might demand an interest in the parking lot as additional security for the entire project.  Additional security is taken by executing a deed of trust with the borrower.  \nA.  Leadership Designee Authorization  \nIn cases where taking additional security is warranted, the MFH Servicing official  \nmust forward the borrower\u2019s case file to the Leadership Designee for authorization, along with a memorandum providing the following information:  \n\u2022 The facts that justify the taking of additional security;  \n\u2022 A conservative estimate of the market value of any real estate to be mortgaged ( Note:   \nIt is not necessary to obtain an appraisal of the property to be mortgaged unless \nrequired by the Leadership Designee.;  \n\u2022 A brief description of any existing liens on the additional security, including the \nrepayment terms and the unpaid balance;  \n\u2022 The name of the title holder and how the title to the property is held ( Note:  Title \nevidence is not required.);  \n\u2022 A plan for servicing the additional security to be taken; and  \n\u2022 A description of other servicing alternatives available to ensure that the objectives of the loan will be met and to protect the Government from loss. \nThe highest quality security available should be taken whenever additional security is \nconsidered.  This means that if several security options are available, the option that has the least amount of risk associated with it (and would thus be easiest to liq uidate if \nnecessary) should be chosen.  Security property with known environmental hazards or other risks generally should not be taken as additional security.  Such risks will generally be identified when the MFH Servicing official  conducts due diligence, including an \nenvironmental review.  When the Agency chooses not to acquire additional security property, whether in whole or in part due to the presence of or potential for release of hazardous substances or petroleum products, the MFH Servicing official  will notify the \nappropriate regulatory authority of the Agency\u2019s findings and actions. \nB.  OGC Advice  \nMFH Servicing official s should obtain OGC advice and assistance whenever \nadditional security is taken.  Specifically, OGC can provide a title opinion, which will \nadvise MFH Servicing official s as to what lien position is available to the Agency.  \n__________________________________________________________________________________________  \n13-6 \n  ",

Bankruptcy, death, and divorce are events that require special attention to ensure that the interests of the tenants and the Government are protected.  Similarly, special agreements that borrowers may have with members of the organization may affect the Agency\u2019s servicing approaches and decisions.  This section addresses such special cas es. \n13.9   REQUIREMENTS FOR ADDRESSING BORROWER ISSUES  \nThe Agency will address borrower accounts affected by special circumstances, such as \ndeath, bankruptcy, insolvency, and divorce, on a case -specific basis.  The Agency will make \nservicing decisions in such cases that are in the best interest of the tenants and the Government.  The Agency will bring legal action questioning the legal capacity of the borrower to administer the project if found necessary to protect the Government\u2019s interest.  The borrower or the borrower\u2019s representative will provide to the Age ncy information concerning the:  \n\u2022 Evidence of legal action, due to a will or court actions that establish who is to become the owner, on the part of the heirs or trustee following the borrower\u2019s death;  \n\u2022 Financial status of the borrower;  \n\u2022 Status of the security property; and  \n\u2022 Impact of the identified actions on the project\u2019s operation.  \nIn general, MFH Servicing official s should obtain the advice of OGC as necessary to handle \ncircumstances involving death, bankruptcy, insolvency, and divorce.  \nA.  Bankruptcy  \nThe handling of bankruptcy cases varies from state to state.  In general, however, \nMFH Servicing official s should obtain and follow the advice of OGC as necessary \nwhenever general partners file for bankruptcy.  \nB.

The Agency will not make subsequent loans to pay equity as a result of a \ndivorce action. \nC.  Membership Liability Agreements  \nAs a loan approval requirement, some borrowers may have special agreements with \nmembers of the organization for the purchase of shares of stock or for the payment of a \npro rata share of the loan in the event of a default.  Alternatively, they may have instruments commonly referred to as individual liability agreements, which are usually \nassigned to and held by the Agency as additional security for the loan.  In other cases, the borrower\u2019s note may be endorsed by individuals.  The Agency will service these security and liability instruments in a manner indicated by the agreements to adequately protect the Agency\u2019s interest.

When the title \ntransfers to the Agency, the property becomes an Agency asset.  The Agency\u2019s objectives in managing and selling its inventory of REO properties include:  \n\u2022 Preserving affordable, decent, safe, and sanitary housing for tenants or potential tenants;  \n\u2022 Maintaining the value of the housing project;  \n\u2022 Protecting the Agency\u2019s financial interests;  \n\u2022 Ensuring that the properties comply with state and local code requirements and applicable environmental regulations; and  \n14.2   OVERVIEW OF THE CHAPTER \nThis chapter is divided into five sections.  \n\u2022 Section 1 describes the management of custodial and REO property.  It describes \nacceptable management methods; discusses issues related to taking possession of \ncustodial and REO properties, such as disposing of nonsecurity property and paying taxes and insurance premiums; and explains requirements related to maintenance, environmental concerns, and other management issues.  \n\u2022 Section 2 covers the disposition of REO property.  It describes the methods for \npricing and selling the properties and outlines procedures for accepting bids from \npotential purchasers.  It also describes the standards the property must meet before being sold.  \n\u2022 Section 3 describes the environmental requirements that must be fulfilled before \nselling an REO property.  These include requirements related to flood and mudslide \nhazard areas, wetlands, coastal barrier resources systems, historic places, protective covenants and easements, underground storage tanks, and hazardous substances.  \n\u2022 Section 4 outlines the procedures for processing and closing the sale of an REO \nproperty.  These procedures are similar to the procedures for closing other Agency \nloans.  This section also highlights some of the special considerations for REO properties.  \n\u2022 Section 5 provides instructions on processing credit sales for non- program terms.  \n14-1 \n(08-30-24)  PN  623 ",

  "page_378": "HB-3-3560 \n SECTION 1: MANAGEMENT OF CUSTODIAL AND REO PROPERTY  \n14.3   OVERVIEW  \nThe Agency assumes management responsibility for two types of properties: custodial \nand REO.  Custodial property is borrower -owned property that has been abandoned.  REO is \nAgency- owned property to which the Agency has acquired title, either as a result of  foreclosure \nor conveyance by deed in lieu of foreclosure.  This section outlines the requirements for \nmanagement of each type of property. \nMFH Servicing official s are responsible for ensuring that custodial and REO properties \nare appropriately managed and maintained.  The goal of property management is to protect the tenants and the interests of the Government.  Consequently, Agency efforts to secure and manage these properties are to begin immediately once the following occurs:  \n\u2022 The property title is conveyed to the Agency; or  \n\u2022 The Agency determines property is abandoned. \n14.4   MANAGEMENT METHODS AND CONTRACTS  \nThe Agency has the authority to contract with qualified management entities to perform \nthe management activities discussed in this section.  The extent of management is dependent on factors such as:  \n\u2022 The nature of the project;  \n\u2022 The project\u2019s location;  \n\u2022 The condition of the project;  \n\u2022 Necessary maintenance; and  \n\u2022 Availability of acceptable management entities.\n  \nIn some cases, the existing management agent can be maintained; in others, the Agency \nmust hire a new management agent to provide all property management services on behalf of the Agency. \nA.  Selecting a Management Contractor  \nManagement contractors are selected in accordance with Agency procurement \nprocedures outlined in RD Instruction 2024- A.  Alternative methods for selecting a \nmanagement contractor may be established by the Agency if it is in the best interest of the Government.  Alternative selection methods require advice from the Office of General Counsel (OGC).  Prior to obtaining a management agent for custodial property, the Agency should determine if court approval is required.  \n14-3 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623 ",
  "page_379": "HB-3-3560 \n B.  Management Contract Requirements  \nAt a minimum, management contracts must:  \n\u2022 Allow for properties to be added or removed from the contractor\u2019s assignment, \nwhenever necessary, such as when a property is taken into custody, acquired, or sold \nduring the period of a contract;  \n\u2022 Prohibit the contractor or associates of the contractor from performing repairs if the \nexecuted agreement calls for the contractor to provide detailed repair specifications;  \n\u2022 Require the management agent to hold security deposits in trust and handle them in \naccordance with the tenant\u2019s lease or occupancy agreement; and  \n\u2022 Require compliance with environmental laws.  \nThe management agent must develop an Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan \n(AFHMP), in accordance with RD Instruction 1901- E. The AFHMP must be submitted to \nthe loan office.  The AFHMP must receive written approval from Rural Development\u2019s  \nCivil Rights  Staff.  Form RD 1955- 62, Request for Contract Services for \nCustodial/Inventory Property or Program Services is a sample statement of work for a project management contract.  \nC.  Management Costs  \nThe costs of management services related to REO property will be paid out of income \ngenerated by the housing project being managed.  If income from the housing project is inadequate to pay for management services, Agency resources may be used to pay for management services.  \nD.  Project Funds  \nWhen a property becomes REO, the Agency transmits operating and maintenance, \nreserve accounts, and escrow funds to the St. Louis Office.  The former borrower\u2019s account is credited for these amounts. If there is a surplus of funds, the St. Louis Office will forward a refund check payable to the former borrower.  \n14.5   TAKING POSSESSION  \nA.  Taking Custodial Possession  \nThe Agency is authorized\n to take custody of security property when a borrower \nbecomes incapacitated, dies, or has abandoned a security property.  When the MFH \nServicing official has attempted for more than 30 days  and is unable to contact a \nborrower, the MFH Servicing o fficial must inspect the property to determine its status \nand attempt to locate and  contact the borrower.  The MFH Servicing o fficial  should seek \nthe advice of OGC in making its determination and recommendation.  \n14-4 \n ",
  "page_380": "HB-3-3560 \n 1.  Determining Whether a Property Has Been Abandoned  \nThe determination that a property has been abandoned requires significant \ninvestigation and documentation.  In addition to the actions described in this paragraph, \nthe MFH Servicing official must follow any procedures required by state or local law in \norder to confirm the determination of abandonment and to take custodial possession. The Agency cannot act to obtain possession of a property as long as a lien holder has legal possession of the property, or the borrower or the lien holder has a right to lease proceeds.  MFH Servicing  officials cannot classify a property as \u201cabandoned\u201d prior to \ndocumenting attempts to:  \n\u2022 Determine that there is no clear evidence of management presence at the project.  For example, a site visit indicates that tenants are unable to contact borrower or property manager regarding repairs or rent collection, the project has fallen into disrepai r due \nto a total lack of maintenance activities, or the Loan Servicer cannot locate the \nborrower or property manager;  \n\u2022 Locate the borrower through sources including, but not limited to, tenants, the postal \nservice, utility companies, business associates, relatives, insurance agents, and tax authorities; and \n\u2022 Determine whether there are other liens on the property .  If liens exist, whether the  \nlien holder(s) are willing to work with the Agency to secure the property.  \n2.  Recommendation for Taking Custody  \nThe MFH Servicing official  will report its findings to the Leadership Designee .  The \nreport will recommend that a property be taken into custodial possession if it appears that the property has been completely abandoned and the Agency needs to assume responsibility for it to protect the security.  Alternatively, if the MFH Servicing o fficial \nreports that the property is occupied, the report will give details as to whether the occupants are under a lease or are unauthorized.  The MFH Servicing offic ial will \nprovide any other relevant details and recommend future action.  When appropriate, the Leadership Designee will authorize the MFH Servicing o fficial to take custodial \npossession.  When the MFH Servicing offic ial believes that a property is abandoned, it \nmust prepare a report that provides evidence of a property\u2019s abandonment.  The report is placed in the borrower\u2019s case file, and a copy of the report is forwarded to the Leadership Designee.  \n3.  Liquidation  \nThe need to take custodial possession of a property may occur before or after a loan \nhas been accelerated.  If liquidation is not already in progress, taking custodial possession should initiate the process.  MFH Servicing o fficials are responsible for conducting \nliquidation activities.  \n14-5 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623 ",

An additional REO case file should be created from the \noriginal case.  The REO case file should include the property title, recent inspection \nreports, appraisals, environmental reviews, and any other documentation related to the physical condition or va lue of the property.  No information related to the borrower is \nneeded in the REO file.  \n14.6   INSPECTING AND SECURING CUSTODIAL AND REO PROPERTY  \nOnce REO property is acquired, a MFH Servicing offic ial must inspect the property to \ndetermine what steps need to be taken to further ensure its security and maintain its value.  The inspection will allow the MFH Servicing offic ial to designate the property as program or non-\nprogram and evaluate the need for repairs.  \nA.  Inspecting and Classifying the Property  \nA MFH Servicing o fficial must perform an on- site field inspection of REO property \nto: \n\u2022 Determine repair needs;  \n\u2022 Gather information to assist in completing the environmental review;  \n\u2022 Assist in updating the due diligence report and appraisal, as necessary; and  \n\u2022 Take necessary actions to secure and maintain the housing project.  \nBased on the results of the inspection, the MFH Servicing offic ial will designate the \nREO property as program or non- program property after considering factors such as size; \ndesign; possible health and/or safety hazards; and obsolescence due to functional, economic, or locational conditions.  REO property may be sold as non- program property  \nit any of the following conditions exist:  \n\u2022 The housing project does not meet Agency requirements and the cost of bringing the housing into compliance is determined, by the Agency, to be economically unfeasible based on the amount of funds available to the Agency and the housing needs in the market area where the housing is located;  \n\u2022 Attempting to sell the property on program terms is not in the best interest of the \nFederal Government; or  \n\u2022 Hazardous substances or petroleum products have been released on the property \nand the cost of cleanup is estimated to exceed the dollar value the Agency will recover through sale of the property.  \n \n14-6 \n ",

Securing Custodial and REO Property  \nWhen the Agency assumes management responsibility and takes possession of REO \nor custodial property, immediate steps must be taken to inspect and secure the property \nwhether by a MFH Servicing o fficial or management contractor.  \n1.  Physical Security of Vacant Properties  \nIf the property is vacant, it should be locked or otherwise secured and a no trespassing \nnotice should be posted.  For REO only, after an inspection determines utility systems are in safe operable condition, utility companies should be contacted to maintai n or reinstate \nutility service.  An inventory should be made of any nonsecurity personal property left on the premises and efforts made to identify any owners or lien holders.  \n2.  REO Properties Occupied by Tenants \nREO property may be occupied by tenants with leases executed by the former \nborrower.  The Agency may require tenants to sign a new lease, but if it is in the best interest of the Government, the Agency may honor existing leases.  The Agency may evict unaut horized tenants.  \nWhen units in an REO property are under an existing lease and the Agency decides to \ncontinue the lease, the tenant must be notified, in writing, that the Agency has acquired \nthe former owner\u2019s rights under the lease and that all payments should be remitted to the Agency\u2019s management agent.  If a lease is to be terminated, the tenant must be notified, in writing, that their lease is being terminated in 30 days , and they must vacate. The OGC \nshould be contacted for advice and assistance prior to evicting a tenant in order to obtain possession of an REO property.  \nRent payments due and payable before the date the Agency acquired the property are \napplied to the borrower\u2019s account.  Any surplus funds will remain with the project.   \n14.7   DISPOSITION OF NONSECURITY PROPERTY  \nThe Agency has no legal claim to any nonsecurity, owner, or tenant property left on the \npremises.  State or local law may affect procedures for disposing of personal property left on the premises of an REO or custodial property.  The Agency must comply with any state or local \nrequirements, as well as the procedures discussed in this paragraph. If the owners or lien holders of any personal property that remains custodial or REO property can be identified and located, the Agency must offer them a reasonable o pportunity to remove the property.  Any conversations \nwith the owner of the property should be documented and placed in the case file.  \n \n14-7 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623 ",
  "page_383": "HB-3-3560 \n A.  Custodial Property  \nThe Agency may remove any nonsecurity personal property from custodial properties \nas long as such property can be safely stored.  Personal property cannot be removed and \nstored if:  \n\u2022 The storage facility presents a hazard to the security of the property, such as a leaking roof or unsecured area, which allows access to the property by unauthorized persons; and \n\u2022 The personal property itself presents a hazard, such as flammables or explosives.  \nHazardous materials must be managed in compliance with Paragraph 14.10.  \nB.  REO Property  \n1.  Notice to Owners or Lien Holders of Personal Property  \nIf the property is not retrieved after the initial notification, a certified letter should be \nsent, return receipt requested, notifying the owner or lien holder of the date on which the \nAgency will dispose of the property, and that the property may be retr ieved before the \ndisposition upon payment of any expenses incurred by the Agency related to the personal property, such as advertisement or storage.  \n2.  Disposal of Unclaimed Property  \nThe Agency will dispose of unclaimed property in accordance with its value and \nconforming with local practices.  For example, if there are items of significant value, an advertisement may be placed in the local newspaper.  Unclaimed tenant property will be disposed of in accordance with the terms of the lease.  \n3.  Income from Disposition  \nProceeds from the sale of items under lien should be paid to any owner or lien holder \nafter deducting Agency selling expenses.  If there is no known owner or lien holder, proceeds are applied to the REO account. \n14.8   TAXES AND INSURANCE  \nA.  Taxes  \nREO property is subject to taxation by state and local political jurisdictions in the \nsame manner and to the same extent as other properties, unless state law specifically exempts property owned by the Federal Government.  If a jurisdiction changes the law  to \nbegin taxing Government -owned property, only taxes accrued after the effective date of \nthe change will be paid.  A MFH Servicing offic ial must notify the taxing authority, in \nwriting, when title to real estate is acquired and provide the MFH Servicing  address to \nwhich tax bills should be sent during Agency ownership.  \n14-8 \n ",
  "page_384": "HB-3-3560 \n If the value of the property is significantly less than the value at which it is being \ntaxed, as soon as it is acquired the Agency may request a new assessment by the local \ntaxing authority.  Management contracts between the Agency and property  managers  \nmay include provisions allowing the management agent to request a new tax assessment.   \nIf property is acquired subject to a prior lien, before the Agency pays taxes, the MFH \nServicing offic ial must contact the prior lien holder to determine if that lien holder will \npay the taxes. \nTaxes on program property are paid when due.  Taxes on non- program property may \nbe deferred until the property is sold if the taxes that accrue before disposition exceed the value of the property.  If the taxing authority schedules a tax sale before the Agency can sell the property, the MFH Servicing offic ial will determine what is in best interest of the \nGovernment.  To make this determination the MFH Servicing offic ial will calculate the \nnet recovery value that would result from paying the taxes and continuing sales efforts.  This calculation will be compared with the net recovery value if the Agency allowed the property to be sold for delinquent taxes. (See Chapter 12 for a more detailed discussion of \nnet recovery value.)  \nB.  Insurance \n1.  Custodial Property  \nInsurance on custodial property will be maintained per program instructions.  \n2.  REO Property  \nInsurance will not be canceled when property is acquired.

Whenever possible, preference will be given to selling REO program property to \na program borrower.  Preference will be given to offers from bidders who are de termined eligible \nby the Agency to purchase REO property designated to be sold as program property.   \nA.  Sale Methods and Pricing  \nMost REO properties are sold through public drawing.  However, the Agency may \nsell properties through auction, sealed bid, negotiation, or agreements with other Federal Agencies, such as the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). \nREO properties are initially priced for sale at their present market value, as \ndetermined by appraisal.  Administrative price reductions may be taken over time to facilitate sale of the property (see Paragraph 14.14 for a discussion of price reduction).  A  \nschedule is published that restricts sales of program property to program -eligible buyers \nfor a period of time before any offering to the general public, and whenever there is a reduction in price.   \nAn Affirmative Fair Housing Marketing Plan, as described in Paragraph 14.15, must \nbe prepared for REO multi -family housing properties of four or more units.   \nB.  Financing  \nWhen funds are available, the Agency may offer financing to buyers of REO \nproperty.  When program credit is offered, the loan is processed following the procedures described in HB -1-3560.   \nNon-program credit terms are offered when the buyer is not eligible for a Section 514 \nor 515 loan, or the property does not qualify as a program property.  Section 5 provides instructions for credit sales on non- program terms.  Buyers who receive financing on \nnon-program terms must be advised that they are not eligible for interest credit or rental \nassistance.  \nC.  Warranty \nThe Agency does not provide a warranty of either the title or the physical condition of \nany REO property.  \n14.12   PRICING AND SALES SCHEDULES  \nREO housing is priced and initially offered for sale at its present market value, based on a \ncurrent appraisal.

Appraisals  \nTo determine the property\u2019s present market value, the MFH Servicing official must \narrange for an appraisal in accordance with the procedures described in Chapter 4, Notice of Funding Availability (NOFA) and Initial Application Process.  If repair or improvement is planned, the appraisal must provide both as -is and as- improved values.  \nEach as- improved appraisal must include a list of the planned repairs.  Any special flood \nor mudslide hazard areas or wetlands and related use restrictions must be reflected i n the \nappraisal.  All REO property considered for disposal or lease must be evaluated for possible contamination from hazardous substances or petroleum products through the process of due diligence and completion of the Transaction Screen Questionnaire ( TSQ) \nas described in Paragraph 14.26.  This will normally be completed at the same time as, or prior to, the appraisal.  \nA property must be reappraised whenever its condition has deteriorated, it has been \nsignificantly damaged or vandalized, additional repairs and improvements have been made, cleanup of hazardous material or lead -based paint, or there has been a change in \nmarket conditions.

Auction Procedures  \nThe Leadership Designee  will determine whether an Agency employee will conduct \nthe auction or whether the complexity of the sale requires the services of a professional \nauctioneer.  Form RD 1955- 46 is used for auction sales.  \n1.  Selecting a Professional Auctioneer  \nAuctioneers are selected through a competitive process using the procedures \ndescribed in RD Instruction 2024- A.  The commission will be set as part of the auctioneer \nsolicitation.  If an auctioneer submits a bid with a commission rate that is significantly lower than other bids, detailed documentation will be provided attesting that they have successfully sold properties at the lower rate with no compromise in service.  \n2.  Bid Deposits  \nSuccessful bidders will be required to make a bid deposit of 10 percent of the \npurchase offer\n.  This fee will be waived for program- eligible bidders, pending final \ndetermination of eligibility.  Deposits should be in the form of cashier\u2019s check, certified check, postal or bank money order, or bank draft payable to the Agency.  Cash and/or personal check may be accepted only if deemed necessary for a successful auction to \noccur by the person conducting the auction.  \nWhere program financing is authorized, all notices and publicity should provide for a \nmethod of prior approval of credit and the credit limit for potential program- eligible \npurchasers.  This may include submission of letters of credit or financial statemen ts prior \nto the auction.  The auctioneer should not accept bids that request program financing in excess of the market value.  \n3.  Accepting Bids  \nWhen the highest bid is lower than the minimum amount acceptable to the Agency, \nnegotiations should be conducted with the highest bidder or, in turn, the next highest bidder(s) or other persons known to be interested in obtaining an executed bid at the predetermined minimum.  \n4.  Purchaser\u2019s Default  \nUpon purchaser\u2019s default, the MFH Servicing official will remit the bid deposit to the \nSt. Louis Office as a miscellaneous collection.  The property may than be disposed of through a negotiated sale. \n14-25 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623 ",

Cooperative agreements with other Federal or state -\nassisted housing programs will be announced and updated with administrative notices.  \n14.20  DISPOSAL AS CHATTEL OR SALVAGE  \nIf the Agency is unable to sell non -program property by regular sale, sealed bid, or public \nauction, the structure may be sold as chattel or salvage to be removed from the site.  Form \nRD 1955- 47 is used to transfer title of real property converted to chattel to the purchaser.  \nIf no offer is received to remove the structure, the Leadership Designee may contract or \narrange to have it demolished, in exchange for the salvaged materials or otherwise as determined appropriate.  For example, the local fire -fighting unit may be permitted to use a structure slated \nfor demolition as a burn for fire fighting practice.  Once the structure is disposed of, the lot is \noffered for sale as non -program REO property.  \nIf REO property is a vacant lot, the lot is offered for sale as non -program property.  \n14-26 \n ",

The proposed disposal \nof REO property will normally qualify as a categorical exclusion.  However, an environmental \nassessment and an en vironmental impact statement (EIS), when deemed necessary, is required \nfor any proposed disposal of REO property that meets one of the following criteria:  \n\u2022 The Agency has evidence that the transaction would result in a change in use of the \nREO property (for example, residential to commercial);  \n\u2022 The transaction is controversial for environmental reasons;  \n\u2022 The original environmental assessment for the project contains mitigation measures \nrequiring an on- going managerial action (such as preservation of an historic building \nor setbacks from wetlands);  \n\u2022 The transaction affects environmental resources identified in 1940- G, or  \n\u2022 The property is contaminated with hazardous substances or petroleum products.  \nThis section summarizes the basic environmental information that pertains to disposal of \nREO properties.

The minimum level of documentation of due diligence is the Transaction Screen Questionnaire  (TSQ), which \nwill be prepared by the Agency or an environmental professional under contract to the Agency.  If the TSQ indicates the possibility of contamination a Phase I Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) will be prepared to determine the types of contamination present.  If determined necessary by the ESA , a Phase II ESA will be prepared to determine the extent and potential costs for \nremediation.  An environmental professional will prepare the ESA.  The SEC should be consulted during this process for guidance and assistance in review and acceptability of t he \nreports.  \nEnvironmental due diligence is normally conducted prior to the Agency taking action to \nforeclose and the reports previously prepared should be reviewed and supplemented as necessary prior to sale or lease.  \n14-28 \n ",

To protect the supply of affordable housing and to ensure that tenants of multi-family housing properties do not suffer from rent over burden or the loss of their units; the Agency requires that borrowers obtain approval before prepaying their loans [7 CFR part 3560, subpart N] .  The approval process may allow the \nAgency to offer the borrower incentives to forgo prepayment and maintain the affordability of the housing.  This chapter explains prepayment requirements and describes the prepayment request and approval process.  15.2 OVERVIEW OF THE CHAPTER  \nThe key decision points in the prepayment process are shown in Exhibit 15-1 of this section.  For an overview of the process, see Attachment 15 -A. \n  This chapter addresses the process in \nfive parts:  \n \n\u2022 Section 1 outlines the key eligibility requirements for participating in the process and obtaining approval to prepay. \n\u2022 Section 2 describes requirements and procedures for processing and evaluating prepayment requests for loans closed before 1979 or loans with no restrictive covenants. \n\u2022 Section 3 describes requirements and procedures for processing and evaluating prepayment requests for loans closed between 1979 and 1989 that have restrictive covenants.  This section also describes the process of offering the property for sale to non- profit \norganizations and public agencies. \n\u2022 Section 4 discusses properties subject to special circumstances, including foreclosure, bankruptcy, acceleration and the advance payment of accounts.

All loans approved prior to December 15, 1989, are subject to prepayment regulations and must file a prepayment application to request payoff of the loan(s).  Loans made on or after December 15, 1989, to build or acquire new multi-family housing units are prohibited from prepayment.  15.5 MEETING WITH THE BORROWER  \n  Whenever MFH Servicing Official s receive an inquiry concerning prepayment, they \nshould invite the borrower to a meeting.  If the borrower begins the prepayment request process with an understanding of the steps involved and the incentives available, the process is more likely to proceed with fewer miscommunications and delays.   At the meeting, the MFH Servicing Official  should: \n \n\u2022 Provide the borrower with the items necessary to constitute a prepayment request in accordance with 7 CFR 3560.653 and review the list of items to be submitted.  Answer any questions regarding the submissions.  Make clear that a complete request includes evidence that the borrower is able to prepay the loan; \n\u2022 Explain the prepayment process, including the procedures for requesting prepayment, the offer of incentives, and the sale to non-profit organizations or public agencies; \n\u2022 Recommend that the borrower hold a meeting with tenants to inform them of the prepayment request and explain the implications of the prepayment process for tenants.

It is not in the Agency\u2019s best interest to offer incentives to a borrower who does not have the financial capacity to prepay the loan since there is li ttle risk that \nthe borrower will actually prepay and remove the project from the program.   The borrower may be planning to refinance the prepayment in one of three ways:  \n\u2022 From the borrower\u2019s own resources; \n\u2022 With financing from a lender or other third- party; or  \n\u2022 By selling the project. \n  Regardless of the source of funds, the borrower must be able to show that the proposed source of financing is available.

SALE  \n  If the borrower is planning to sell the project, the borrower must submit a purchase agreement and documentation of the purchaser\u2019s ability to pay.  The purchaser\u2019s ability to pay can be documented in the same manner as the borrower\u2019s, as described in Paragraph 15.10 A.  \n 15.11 ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION  \n  If the MFH Servicing Official  determines that the borrower is eligible with a complete \nprepayment request and prepayment is feasible, the MFH Servicing Official  continues to process \nthe request.  If the borrower is not eligible for prepayment, the MFH Servicing Official notifies the borrower in writing stating the reasons that the borrower is not eligible for prepayment.   For loans that were closed prior to 1979, or if the loan does not have any existing restrictive covenants, the MFH Servicing Official  follows the process described in Section 2 of \nthis chapter.

The MFH Servicing Official  should make a general offer only if the borrower indicates that any specific \nincentive offer will be rejected.  From the date of the general offer, the borrower has 30 calendar \ndays to accept or reject the offer.  \n \n\u2022 If the borrower rejects the general offer in writing, the Agency will not develop a specific incentive offer.  The Agency will determine the impact of prepayment as described in Paragraph 15.22. \n\u2022 If the borrower accepts the general offer, the Agency will develop a specific incentive offer in accordance with this section. \n\u2022 If the borrower rejects the general offer in writing after 30 calendar days, the Agency will not complete the specific incentive offer and will consider all incentives rejected.  \n 15.15 SPECIFIC INCENTIVE REQUIREMENTS [7 CFR 3560.656] \n  Specific incentive offers are subject to the following requirements.  \n\u2022 Value of incentive offer.   The incentive offer must be based on the Agency\u2019s assessment \nof: \n \n\uf0d8 The amount necessary to provide a fair return on the investment of the borrower; \n\uf0d8 An amount that will not cause project rents to increase above the Conventional Rents for Comparable Units (CRCU) standard in accordance with Chapter 4 of HB-2-3560; and \n\uf0d8 The lease costly alternative for the Federal Government that is consistent with extending the low-income use of the property. \n \n\u2022 Eligible recipients.   The Agency will offer incentives only to borrowers who have met \nthe requirements outlined in Section 1 of this chapter. \n\u2022 T\nimeframe for offer response.   The Agency must develop the offer within 60 days of \ncompleting the review for feasibility and impact.  The borrower must respond to an incentive offer within 30 calendar days.  If no answer to the offer is received within       \n30 calendar days, the Agency must consider the incentive offer rejected. \n\u2022 R eserve requirements.   At the time the incentive is developed, the maximum reserve \namount must be adjusted to include the costs of any deferred maintenance items or expected long- term repair or replacement costs of the project based on the project\u2019s \ncapital plan.  The Agency may require an additional deposit to the reserve account from the incentive package and/or reduce the incentive in order to allow the rents to be increased to fund the reserve at a level necessary to meet capital needs.

  "page_423": " \n\u2022 Capital improvements.  Any necessary capital improvements must be addressed \n(monies set -aside) prior to receiving any incentives. \n\u2022 Consolidation and reamortization of loans.  If a project has more than one Agency \nloan, existing project loans must be consolidated and reamortized unless consolidation is not necessary to maintain feasibility of the project for the current tenants or the level of monthly rental subsidies must be reduced. \n\u2022 Appraisal requirements.   An appraisal is required to provide the Agency the \ninformation  needed to establish the appropriate value of the incentive offer.  It is the \nAgency\u2019s responsibility to assure that an appraisal is obtained. \n 15.16 TYPES OF INCENTIVES [7 CFR 3560.656(C)]  \n  The Agency may offer the borrower one or more of the items discussed below as incentives to forgo prepayment.  The following considerations apply to the development of the incentive package:  \n \n\u2022 Incentive offers must not be made without sufficient Rental Assistance (RA) to protect \ncurrent tenants against rent overburden.  Unused State RA may be used to facilitate these \ntransactions; alternatively, borrowers may elect to be placed on the Agency w aiting l ist \nuntil RA is available.  \n\u2022 If the incentive package involves a rent increase, the Agency must approve the rent increase in accordance with budget approval procedures outlined in Chapter 4 of HB-2-3560.  In no case may the rent increase cause rents to increase above the CRCU standard; except that when determined necessary by the Agency to allow for decent, safe and sanitary housing to be provided in market areas where conventional rents are not sufficient to cover necessary operating, maintenance and reserve costs.  Basic rents may be allowed to exceed comparable rents for conventional unit rent level; and 150 percent of the comparable rents for conventional unit level, as discussed in Chapter  4 of HB-2-3560 [7 CFR 3560.656(b)(3)] ; and  \n\u2022 An Agency equity loan must be the last incentive option considered in developing an offer.  \n \nA. Rental Assistance  \n  The Agency may offer RA if the project tenants will experience rent overburden as a result of the incentive offer.  \n \nB. Increase in Annual Return  \n  The Agency may offer an increase in the amount of the borrower\u2019s annual return on investment by one or both of the following methods:  \n\u2022 The Agency may recognize the borrower\u2019s current equity in the project at the original rate of return; and/or \n\u2022 The Agency may increase the borrower\u2019s rate of return on the original equity. \n HB-3-3560  \n      15-10 ",

Excess HUD Section 8 Rents  \n  For projects with project- based HUD Section 8 assistance, the Agency may permit the \nborrower to receive rents paid to the project in excess of the amounts needed to meet annual project operating and maintenance expenses, debt service and reserve requirements.  This payment is received in a lump sum.   In these cases, the reserve account will be adjusted to provide adequate funding for long-term capital repairs and maintenance based on the project\u2019s capital plan.  \n \nD. Project Conversion or Modifications of Interest Rate  \n  The Agency may agree to convert full- profit  loans to limited profit Plan II loans or \nincrease the interest subsidy for loans with HUD Section 8 assistance to lower the interest rate on the loan and make basic rents more financially feasible.  \n \nE. Agency Equity Loans \n  The Agency may make an equity loan to the borrower.  The Agency may offer an equity loan only after it determines that all other incentive options will not result in an adequate incentive offer.  The equity loan may not exceed the difference between the current unpaid loan balance and 90 percent of the project\u2019s value appraised as unsubsidized conventional housing.   The following requirements apply to equity loans:  \n\u2022 Labor housing projects are not eligible for equity loans; \n\u2022 The loan must not adversely affect the borrower\u2019s prepayment ability; \n\u2022 Equity loans may be processed and closed with the current borrower or any eligible transferee; and  \n\u2022 If the equity loan is made in conjunction with excess HUD Section 8 funds, the equity will be paid using excess reserves before an equity loan is made.  \n \nF. Third -Party Equity Loans \n  A third -party equity loan is not considered an incentive, but it is an option the Agency \nmay give the borrower at the same time it makes an incentive offer.  \n \n\u2022 All incentive requirements described in Paragraph 15.15 apply to third -party equity loans; \n\u2022 An offer to allow the borrower to receive a third-party equity loan must be included in the \nincentive calculation worksheet located in PRE -TRAC or by completing and Excel \nspreadsheet version for consideration in the Agency\u2019s incentive offer; \n\u2022 In exchange for taking a third-party equity loan, the borrower must agree to the \napplicable 20 -year use restrictions and all relevant requirements under this chapter; HB-3-3560  \n15-11 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623 ",

Transfers  \n \n If a transfer is to take place simultaneously with the Agency incentive offer, a complete \ntransfer application package must be submitted as described in Chapter 7 of this handbook.  \n\u2022 I\nf a proposed transferee is determined not to be eligible for the transfer and assumption, \nthe borrower will be given an additional 45 days to reconsider whether to accept the \noriginal incentive offer or find another transferee; and \n\u2022 I n some cases, the Agency may make an offer of incentives contingent on the successful \ntransfer of the project to an acceptable purchaser.  The Agency may offer a smaller incentive if the transfer does not take place.  \n 15.20 I NSUFFICIENT FUNDING FOR INCENTIVES  \n  I\nn some cases, the borrower may be offer incentives that can not be provided immediately.  For example, the Agency may lack funding for equity loans or sufficient RA.  If a borrower accepts an incentive offer but the Agency is unable to fund the incentive within          15 months, the borrower will be removed from the incentive waiting list.

After prepayment, the property leaves the program.  Processing the prepayment request  is described in 15.22. \n  If the project is needed, or there is an adverse impact on minorities, the MFH Servicing Official  must send the borrower a letter informing the borrower of four options: \n \n\u2022 The borrower may prepay the Agency loan subject to use restrictions.  The letter should describe the applicable use restrictions.  Guidance on how to determine the appropriate use restriction is described in Paragraph 15.22 A. \n\u2022 If the borrower does not want to accept the use restrictions, the borrower may offer the property for sale to non-profit organizations and public agencies.  This process is described in Section 3 of this chapter. \n\u2022 The borrower may forgo prepayment and stay in the program. \n\u2022 The borrower may appeal the decision to prepay with use restrictions.  The borrower and \nAgency follow the appeal procedures described in Chapter 1. \n \n The letter should also request the borrower to send a written response indicating the bor\nrower\u2019s intentions within 30 days. \n  If the borrower chooses to prepay the loan subject to restrictive-use provisions, the MFH Servicing Official  must determine the appropriate use restrictions to apply.  The analysis for \nmaking this determination follows:  \n\u2022 For prepayments that will have an adverse impact on minorities.  If the borrower chooses to prepay subject to use restrictions, the Agency must make a determination regarding the impact of the prepayment on minorities.  Loan Servicing Staff should consult with the Civil Rights Staff to make this determination.  The Civil Rights Staff\u2019s role is limited to the assessment of prepayment impact on minorities.  Accepting prepayment with or without restrictions is an Agency determination.  Relevant factors include: \n \n\uf0d8 The percentage of minorities residing in the project and the percentage of minorities residing in the projects in the market area where displaced tenants are most likely to move ; HB-3-3560  \n15-14 ",

In projects where the prepayment does not have an adverse impact \non minorities, the borrower is required to adopt use restrictions that protect the access of current tenants to adequate affordable housing.  The rent will remain at the subsidized amount even though the tenant will no longer receive RA.  These provisions prohibit the borrower from raising rents for tenants who live in the property at the time of pr epayment \nunless the rent increase is necessary to meet the operating cost of the project.  (Their rents can not be raised as a result of actions associated with prepayment.)  \n 15.22 DETERMINATION OF PREPAYMENT IMPACT  \n  One of the Agency\u2019s key goals in the prepayment process is to ensure that affordable housing opportunities exist for program eligible tenants.  Therefore, one of the most important issues to address is the impact of the prepayment on project tenants.  In cases where prepayment will have little or no impact on project rents or availability of units, the Agency has less interest in keeping the property in the program than in cases where prepayment will likely result in the displacement of project tenan ts. \n  To make this determination, the MFH Servicing Official  will review the following \ninformation:  \n\u2022 Existence of comparable conventional units, their rents and vacancy rates; \n\u2022 Any plans to build a similar project in the market area; and \n\u2022 Other subsidized units and the availability of RA. \n  The goal of this analysis is to determine if tenant will lose their units or suffer from rent \noverburden.  The steps involved in the analysis of impact depend on whether the project has RA.  \nA. Prepayment Impact on Projects without Rental Assistance \n HB-3-3560  \n15-15 \n(08-30-24)  PN 623 ",

The MFH Servicing Official  must look at the impact \nof the prepayment on tenant\u2019s ability to stay in the project.  This analysis depends on the proposed use of the project after prepayment and rents for comparable conventional units in the market area.  (For example, if the proposed use of the project is conventional rental units, the Loan Servicer should compare rents in the project to conventional rents in the market area.)  Likely rents should be compared to tenant\u2019s inc ome to ensure that a change \nin rents will not result in rent overburden. \n \n\uf0d8 If prepayment is not likely to result in an increase in rents above current rents or 30 percent of tenant\u2019s adjusted incomes, the prepayment is considered to have no adverse impact on project tenants; and \n\uf0d8 If prepayment is likely to result in an increase in rents that will create rent overburden, the Loan Servicer must consider the availability of alternative comparable housing as described below. \n \n\u2022 Availability of alternative housing.  If the proposed us of the project after prepayment is likely to cause an increase in rents or a loss of units, the Loans Servicer must assess the availability of comparable housing in the community.  The Loan Servicer must determine if there is sufficient housing that is comparable in size and rent to house project tenants in local communities without causing them rent overburden. \n \n\uf0d8 If there is sufficient comparable housing in the local community to replace the units that will be lost after prepayment, then the prepayment is considered to have no adverse impact on project tenants; and \n\uf0d8 If sufficient comparable housing is not available in the local community, the prepayment is considered to have an adverse impact on project tenants. \n \nB. Prepayment Impact on Projects with Rental Assistance \n  If project tenants have RA, the Loan Servicer must conduct the same analysis as \ndescribed in Paragraph 15.22 A.  However, in assessing the availability of comparable affordable units, the Loan Servicer must identify comparable units with RA or other rental subsidy such as HUD Section 8 (as long as the tenants will have priority for these units).  \n\u2022 If sufficient comparable units with RA are available in the local community to house all tenants with RA (for example, if another Section 515 project in the local community has vacancies to house the tenants from this prepaid property), the prepayment is considered to have no adverse impact. \n\u2022 If insufficient units with RA are available, the prepayment is considered to have an adverse impact on project tenants. \n  Exhibit 15-3 of this section provides an overview of the full analysis of impact.  \n15-16 HB-3-3560  ",

If a borrower \naccepts the Agency\u2019s request to enter into a 20 -year restrictive-use agreement, without \nprepayment, no further action is necessary.   After receiving a complete application to prepay and determining the borrower\u2019s ability to prepay, the Agency must make a reasonable effort to enter into a new restrictive- use \nagreement with the borrower before accepting prepayment of a restricted loan.   If a borrower declines the Agency\u2019s offer, the MFH Servicing Official  should document \nthis in writing, noting the date on which this information was obtained.

Based on communication with the owner so far, it is not clear whether:   \n\u2022 The owner plans to continue to operate the apartments as affordable housing.  \nOr, \n \n\u2022 The owner wants to pay their USDA loan in full and then either sell \nor operate the apartments as conventional, market rate apartments.  USDA would no longer be involved in the oversight of the apartment\u2019s management, leases and rent structure.  Or,  \n \n\u2022 The owner wants to sell the property to a new owner who is willing to continue to operate the apartments as affordable rental housing.  Or, \n  \n\u2022 The owner has requested to pay their loan in full to qualify for \nfinancial incentives from USDA and DOES NOT plan to pay the \nUSDA loan in full.  In return for the incentives, the owner will agree \nto remain in the USDA program and continue to operate the \napartments as affordable rental housing, including the continued \navailability of Rental Assistance, if the property has Rental Assistance \navailable, and continued oversight by USDA.   \n \n_____________________________________________________________________________________  \n \n HB-3-3560  \nAttachment 15 -C \nPage 1 of 6  \n(08-30-24) PN 623  \nRevised (08-15-25)  PN 650  ",

Upon request, tenants may review the information submitted with the prepayment request.  \n We ask that you send us your written comments and concerns regarding the owner\u2019s request to pay the USDA loan in full, within 30 days from the date of this letter.

The process evaluates the effect to minorities and the availability of other affordable housing units in the market area if the Owner is appro ved to pay the loan in full.  \nUSDA will provide future notifications of the status of the Owner\u2019s request to pay the loan in full, including if the Owner is approved to make the final loan payment.   Rural Development may offer various financial incentives to the owners to encourage them to remain in the Rural Development program and to continue to operate the apartments as affordable rental housing under the Rural Development program.  Often such ince ntives are \nsufficient to prevent the owner from paying the loan in full, and the apartment will continue to be operated without change for the tenants.  However, if the owner is not interested in the financial incentive(s) that Rural Development may \noffer, the Agency will evaluate how accepting the final loan payment will affect the tenants of \nthe apartments.  \n_____________________________________________________________________________________  \n HB-3-3560  \nAttachment 15 -C \nPage 2 of 6  ",

The Director will not consider any request for reconsideration that does not contain a detailed statement of a material error of fact made in the determination, or a detailed explanation of how the determination is contrary to statute or regulation, which would justify reversal or modification of the determination.  \n (b) The Director shall issue a notice to all parties as to whether a request for reconsideration meets the criteria in paragraph (a) of this section.

In the second situation, a party may desire to receive notice of and perhaps participate in an appeal because of the derivative impact the appeal determination will have on that party, e.g., guaranteed lenders and reinsurance companies. The provisions in this section set forth rules for the participation of such third and interested parties.  \n (a) Third parties. When an appeal is filed, the Division shall notify any potential third party whose rights may be adjudicated of its right to participate as an appellant in the appeal. This includes the right to seek Director review of the Hearing Officer determination. Such third parties may be identified by the Division itself, by an agency, or by the original appellant. The Division shall issue one notice to the third party of its right to participate, and if such party declines to participate, the Division determination will be binding as to that third party as if it had participated. For purposes of this part, a third party includes any party for which a determination of the Division could lead to an agency action on implementation that would be adverse to the party thus giving such party a right to a Division appeal.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(08-30-24)  PN 623",
