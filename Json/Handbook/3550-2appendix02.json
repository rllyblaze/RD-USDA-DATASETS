    "Loan_Arrears_Info": "If your loan is in arrears all delinquent payments must be paid immediately if you plan to continue with the loan. You will be expected to make scheduled payments on or before the due date and to comply with all covenants of the Promissory Note and mortgage documents securing your loan. These requirements include maintaining adequate property insurance and paying taxes when they are due. Noncompliance with these stipulations may result in foreclosure.",

This will include sending monthly billing statements and delinquency notices when applicable. You are entitled to all RHS program benefits for which you may be eligible such as payment assistance, moratorium, and applicable appeal rights. Because your debt was not reaffirmed, you are not legally obligated to repay the loan; however, if you intend to remain in the property, required payments must be made every month. In the event of default, RHS will not seek to collect from you personally but will look only to the security property for recovery of the debt.",
