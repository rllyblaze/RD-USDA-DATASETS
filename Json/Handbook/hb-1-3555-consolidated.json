However, no H andbook can provide guidance \nadequate for every c ircumstance , therefore  Agency staff is available to answer specific \nquestions . \nAgency staff will not make underwriting decisions for a lender; however, they will \nhelp the lender understand the intent of the applicable requirements and provide guidance \nabout th e kind s of information that the lender should obtain to document its decision-\nmaking processes.  Additional training may also be provided by Agency staff with regard \nto particular program requirements that a lender finds difficult to fulfill properly . \nThe Agency is committed to providing timely r esponses to lender  inquiries .

  "page_14": "HB-1-3555 \n \n \n 1-4    1.5 SFHGLP SUMMARY  \nPrivate le nders are key to the success of the SFHGLP.  Although the Agency issues \nloan guarantees, lenders that have been approved to participate in the program are \nresponsible for origi nating, underwriting, servicing, and liquidating loans.  The lender is \nultimately responsible for ensuring that all program requirements are met, and that the underwriting procedures for the loan are followed.  The Agency reviews each loan  \nproposal to ensure the applicant and property appear to meet program eligibility \nrequirements an d monitors lender performance on an ongoing basis to help ensure that \nlenders accurately understand the Agency\u2019s expectations.  \nApplicant eligibility is discussed in detail in c hapters  8 through 11.  In summary, \napplicants may be eligible to receive a guaranteed loan if they:  \n\u2022 Are income -eligible;  \n\u2022 Agree to personally occupy the dwelling as their primary residence;  \n\u2022 Have a cceptable c itizenship or i mmigration s tatus, as defined in Ch apter 8 ; \n\u2022 Have the legal capacity to incur the loan obligation;  \n\u2022 Have not been suspended or debarred from participation in Federal programs;  \n\u2022 Have demonstrated both the willingness and the ability to repay the loan; and  \n\u2022 Are purchasing a propert y that meet s all prog ram criteria.  \nIn the event that a lender incurs a loss on a guaranteed loan, the Agency will \ncompensate the lender  under the terms o f the Loan Note Guarantee and  all program \nrequirements.  \n \nSECTION 3:  GENERAL PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS  \n \n1.6 CIVIL RIGHTS   \n The Agency , participating lenders , and agents  of participating lenders, including \nappraisers, must administer the SFHGLP fairly and in accordance with all equal \nopportunity and fair housing legislation and applicable Executive Orders.  Below is a list \nof the pertine nt Federal laws and Executive O rders , as well as a brief description and \nhighlights.  While lenders will be familiar with many of these requirements, they should carefully  review applicable legislation and orders , especially if new to Federally -\nconducted p rograms.  Agency staff should refer to RD Instruction 1901 -E for guidance \non relevant civil rights requirements.",

Major Civil Rights Laws Affecting the SFHGLP  \n\u2022 The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) prohibits discrimina tion in the \nextension of credit on the  basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, \nmarital status, age, income from public assistance , or because an applicant has in \ngood faith exercise d any right under the Consumer Protection Act.  A n applicant \nor borrower who believes he o r she has been discriminated by Rural Development  \nfor any of these reasons  may write to the Secretary of Agriculture, Washington, \nD.C. 20250.   \n\u2022 Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968  (also known as the Fair Housing Act \nof 1988, as amended)  is enforced  by the U .S. Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment.  The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in the sale, rental or \nfinancing of housing on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, familial status, or disability.  \n\u2022 Section 504 of  the Reha bilitation Act of 1973 p rohibits discrimination by the \nFederal government on the basis of disability.   An applicant or borrower who \nbelieves he or she has been discriminated by Rural Development on the basis of disability may write to the Secretary of Agri culture, Washington, D.C. 20250.   \n\u2022 Executive Order 11063 as Amended by 12259 prohibits discrimination in housing or residential property financing for  any Federal ly assisted activity \nagainst individuals on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.  \nB. Nondiscrimination Practices  \nThe applicable  civil rights laws  prohibit the denial of loans, services, and benefits \nprovided under the SFHGLP to any person based upon race, color, national origin, sex, religion, marital status, familial s tatus, ag e, disability, source of income, or because the \napplicant has, in good faith, exercised any right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 U.S.C. 1601).  This applies to the Agency, participating lenders, and agents of \nparticipating lenders, including appraisers.  Discrimination in employment practices is also prohibited.  \nThe Agency is responsible for providing guidance and oversight to participating \nlenders  and the ir agents , including appraisers , to ensure procedures are consistently met.  \nImportant  key areas are listed below.  \n\u2022 Outreach .  Information about the availability of the program and how to apply \nmust be broadly disseminated, and the extent of the information, assistance, and courtesy extended to those who make inquiries must be consi stent.",

Liquidation and any subsequent property \ndisposition must be executed in a fair and consistent manner.  Property disp osition \npractices, like  those outlined for outreach, must ensure  that no person has an \nunfair advantage in acquiring foreclosed property.  \nC. Reasonable Accommodations for Persons with Disabilities  \nParticipating lenders and their agents must make reasonable a ccommodations to \npermit persons with disabilities to apply for and benefit from Agency programs.  \nReasonable accommodations may include providing facilities that are physically \naccessible and effective communication and outreach tools so that all applicant s can get \ngood program information, for example, a Telecommunications Device for the Deaf (TDD).  \n1.7 REVIEWS AND APPEALS  \nAgency decisions that are not made in favor of a lender or other program participant \n(applicant or borrower) are known as adverse  decision s and may be reviewed or \nappealed.  Adverse decisions must be based upon 7 CFR Part 3555 found in Appendix 1 of this H andbook.   \nAdverse decisions include the administrative actions taken by Agency staff; and the \nAgency\u2019s failure to take required actions w ithin time frames specified in statutes or \nregulations, or within a reasonable time if no deadline is specified.  Adve rse decisions \nmade by a lender are not an Agency decision.  Adverse decisions  made by the Agency \nmay be appealed to USDA, Nationa l Appeals  Division (NAD) in accordance with \nAppendix 3 of this Handbook.   ",

Any exception \nmust be consistent with the authorizing statute and other applicable laws.   \nA. Who Can File a Requ est \nOnly Agency staff may file a request for an exception.  However, lenders can request \nthat th e Agency consider submission of a formal request for exception.  When asking the \nAgency to consider requesting an exception, the lender should include documenta tion \nthat demonstrates how the exception would protect the Government\u2019s interest or maintai n \nconsistency with the program\u2019s authorizing statute.  \nB. What Must Be Included in the Request  \nThe exception request developed by the Agency for the Administrator, or designee, \nmust provide clear and convincing evidence of the need for the exception.

In order to avoid conflicts of interest, applicants and borrowers must disclose to the lender any prohi bited \nrelationship or association with any Rural Development employee  and the lender must \nreport this information to the Agency.   Lenders must also disclose to the Agency any \nprohibited relationship or association that it or any of its employees has with any Rural \nDevelopment employee.  \nA. Prohi bited Rel ationships  \nProhibited relationships and associations include:  \n\u2022 Immediate family members, including parents and children, whether related by blood or marriage, and any household residents;  \n\u2022 Close relatives, i ncluding grandmother, grandfather, aunt, uncle, sis ter, brother, \nniece, nephew, granddaughter, grandson, or first cousin, whether related by blood or marriage;  \n\u2022 Immediate working relationships, including co -workers in the same office, \nsubordinates, and imme diate supervisors; and  \n\u2022 Close business asso ciations with an identity of financial interest, including, but \nnot limited to, business partnerships, joint ventures, or closely- held corporations.  \nB.

A copy of the notice will be \nprovided to the lender and Agenc y employe e. \n1.11 UNAUTHORIZED ASSISTANCE  \nUnauthorized assistance occurs when a borrower is not eligible for all or part of the \nfinancial assistance received in the form of a loan guarantee.  Loans made to unqualified \nborrowers or made for an ineligible pur pose are  consider ed unauthorized assistance.  The \nform of unauthorized assistance can differ based upon false information or inaccurate information.  \nUnauthorized assistance may be identified through audits, reviews by the Agency or \nits agents, or as report ed by lenders.  Chapter 16, Attachment 16- B provides guidance for \nsubmitting lender self -reports .  The significance of the unauthorized assistance will \ndetermine the Agency\u2019s response in accordance with Section 3555.257 of 7 CFR Part \n3555. \nWhen the Agency becomes aware of u nauthorized assistance due to false information \nprovided by the applicant, the lender  may be required  to accelerate the loan request.  \nFailure of the lender to accelerate the loan may result in reduction of a loss claim and/or voiding th e guarant ee.  Based upon the severity, the Agency may pursue criminal and \ncivil false claim actions, suspension and/or debarment , or other appropriate action s. \nThe Agency will document the findings surrounding the unauthorize d assistance in \ndetail and provide a sol ution on disposition of the case.  \n1.12 AGENCY LOAN A PPROV AL AUTHORITY G UIDELINES  FOR  THE SFHGLP  \nAll new loan specialists working in the SFHGLP  are expected to receive loan \napproval authority prior to officially issuing decisions on program applications .

For its success, the program relies on lenders to make sound \nunderwriting decisions. Because the Agency does not underwrite the loans it guarantees, lenders that apply for loan guarantees must originate, underwrite, service, and hold loans responsibly. To ensure that these standards are met, the Agency must  approve a lender  \nbefore it participates  in the SFHGLP.  To be approved, a lender must agree to follow the \nAgency\u2019s program guidelines and consistently demonstrate high-quality in the areas of loan origination, underwriting, servicing, and reporting. Once  the Agency has approved \nthe lender, it may participate in the program as long as it maintains these standards and \ncontinues to follow all program requirements.  The Agency periodically monitors \napproved lenders to verify  that continued program participation is warranted.  \n3.2 LENDER APPROVAL CRITERIA [7 CFR 3555.51]  \nA lender must  demonstrate that it has the expertise  to make and/or service single- \nfamily housing mortgage loans. \nLenders that have been ap proved for single -family housing loan- making activities by \norganizations referenced in Paragraph A of this section are considered to have demonstrated the ability  to originate,  underwrite, and service  SFHGLP  loans. In all other \ncases, the Agency determines whether a lender is qualified by reviewing the lender\u2019s history, along with other documentation. \nIn all cases,  lenders are required to provide evidence that all principal officers have a \nminimum of two years of experience in originating or servicing guaranteed mortgage loans. In addition, all guaranteed lenders must be registered in the System for Award \nManagement (SAM) system, which is validated by the Agency in the lender app roval \nprocess.  \nA.Approval from  Another  Recognized  Source\nAcceptable documentati on includes a copy of the official letter or other verifiable\ncommunication from an acceptable secondary market organization or other Federal government agency  showing that the lender is approved for participation  by that entity.  \nThe lender must also provi de the additional documentation listed in Attachment 3 -A,\n ",

The Agency will provide notice of \nall program changes; however, lender s are responsible for remaining informed of  all \nprogram policies and procedures and ensuring that lender staff is adequately trained.  The \nAgency encourages lenders to attend or participate in training provided by the Agency or \nother approved methods, as outlined in Chapter 3 of this Handbook.  For Agency provided training, the Lender and Partner  Activities  Branch can arrange training for \nlenders and their staff members.   New lenders who request participation in the SFHGLP \nby submitting Form RD 3555-16, Agreement for Participation in Single Family Housing Guaranteed/Insured Loan Programs of the United States Government, are  required to \ntake training prior to approval by the Agency.  Lenders are encouraged to register for automatic email notification regarding loan origination  and servicing updates.  Lenders \nmay register at: https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USDARD/subscriber/new\n.   \n \n4.2 OPERATE RESPONSIBLY  \nThe lender must:  \n\u2022 Operate in a prudent and businesslike manner.  A lender that maintains approval from Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, VA, or HUD (as outlined in Chapter 3 of this Handbook) is presumed to act responsibly if  all elements of the Lender \nAgreement are maintained . \n\u2022 Establish and maintain adequate written policies for loan origination, underwriting, servicing, and quality control.  Refer  to Chapter 3 for additional \nguidance on quality control plans.  It must be compliant for the organization on which approval is based and include a representative sampling of SFHGLP loans.

Lenders remain responsible \nfor complying with all applicable Federal lending laws.  \n4.3 MAINTAIN A WELL -TRAINED STAFF  \nA lender must ensure that its loan processors, underwriters, and servicers are fully \ntrained to implement the SFHGLP  properly and document this training was provided \nbefore  originating  SFHGLP loans. \n\u2022 Maintain knowledgeable staff.   The lender must ensure that new staff members \nare trained on relevant SFHGLP  areas.   Lenders will ensure that all staff utilizing \nthe Guaranteed Underwriting System  (GUS)  and Lender Loan Closing (LLC)  \nsystem  are up to date on mandatory trainings.

If the Agency finds that a lender needs to improve \nits performance, the Agency will require training for the lender\u2019s staff.  \n4.4 COLLECT LOAN PAYMENTS AND ENSURE PAYMENT OF TAXES AND INSURANCE  \nThe servicing lender , or their representative,  must collect the borrower\u2019s monthly \npayment and apply the funds to the borrower\u2019s account in accordance with the terms of \nthe promissory note and mortgage.  The servicing lender  must maintain first lien position \nand ensure that real estate taxes and hazard insurance premiums are paid when they are due.  If tax and insurance funds are collected from the borrower, they must be held in escrow in accordance with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFP B) \nregulations .

Procedure  \nA SFHGLP loan may be sold only to an Agency-approved lender, Fannie Mae, or \nFreddie Mac.  The selling lender must report any guaranteed loan sale to the Agency by \nusing Form RD 3555-11, Lender Record Change .  The notification of transfer of the \nloan(s) should be emailed  to the Rural Development Servicing Office  at \nRD.SO.HSB@usda.gov .  If the loan is sold to a party not approved to participate in the \nSFHGLP , the Loan N ote G uarantee will be considered invalid . Should a lender be unable \nto complete the sale of a loan due to the loss of the original Loan Note G uarantee, the \nlender may request a copy from the Agency.  The Agency will provide a copy marked \u201cReissued Loan Note Guarantee.\u201d  If the loan was closed in the Agency\u2019s Lender Loan \nClosing System, the lender can access a duplicate copy within the system.\n \n \nB. Purchaser Risks and Responsibilities  \nThe purchaser of a SFHGLP loan acquires all the rights of a loan holder under the \nguarantee.  This means that, should there ever be a loss, the purchaser is entitled to file a loss claim with the Agency.  However, the purchaser must ensure that it properly fulfills all servicing obligations  and must provide the Agency any requested assistance for its \nprogram monitoring.  Negligent servicing  actions from the lender  may  invalidate  the \nLoan  Note  Guarantee.  \nNegligent servicing is defined as servicing that is inconsistent with \u00a73555.252 and \nincludes the failure to perform those services which a reasonably prudent lender would \nperform in servicing its own loan portfolio of loans that are not guaranteed.   Examples \ninclude, but are not limited to , violation of usury laws, civil rights laws, servicing \nrequirements, failure to obtain the required security, and use of loan funds for \nunauthorized purposes.  The Agency maintains the authority to enforce this policy \nregardless of the timeframe in which R ural Development is made aware of such \naction.  Negligent servicing includes not only the concept of a failure to act, but also not \nacting in a timely manner or acting contrary to the way a reasonably prudent lender \nwould act up to the time of loan maturity or until a final loss is paid . \n4.7 REPORT SIGNIFICANT CHANGES  \nThe lender must immediately inform the Agency, in writing, of significant changes in \nits structure or status.  Failure to keep the Agency informed of changes in accordance with Form RD 3555-16 could lead to withdrawal of approval.  Significant changes include instances where the lender:  \n\u2022 Changes its name, location, address, tax identification number, or corporate \nstructure;  \n\u2022 Changes its fidelity bonding or errors and omissions insurance coverage; ",

Failure to comply could result in \nreduction or denial of a loss claim or revocation of approval to participate in the program.  These program guidelines include:  \n\u2022 Approved Forms .  The lender must use forms approved by the FHA, Fannie \nMae, Freddie Mac, or Farm Credit S ystem ( FCS) lenders when forms are not \nprovided by the Agency.  \n\u2022 Eligibility Requirements .

However, the process of requesting, issuing, and \nreceiving the loan guarantee is one in which the lender and the Agency must cooperate closely.  Lenders must provide the Agency with clear and accurate information so that Agency staff can promptly determine whether the loan qualifies for a guarantee.  At the same time, Agency staff must process loan applications quickly and accurately to avoid delays that might hamper the lender\u2019s efforts to close the loan efficiently.   \n5.2 REQUESTING A GUARANTEE  [7 CFR 3555.151]  \nNot all loans are appropriate for the SFHGLP.  The lender should determine whether, \nbased on preliminary information, it appears that the loan will meet the program\u2019s criteria.  The lender  should answer the preliminary eligibility  questions  below  to assist in making \nthis determination. The  lender  should also ensure that the applicant s are fully informed \nabout the requirements of the program.  \nA. Preliminary Determination of Applicant Eligibility  \nIn general, the program is most appropriately used to offset the risk of making high \nloan- to-value loans in rural areas.  It is not intended to offset risks that stem from a poor \ncredit history or poor property condition.  In particular, the lender should review the \nfollowing items to make a preliminary determination of the applicants \u2019 eligibility.  \n\u2022 Applicant Characteristics (Chapter 8) Are  the applicant s able to secure \nconventional credit?  Do the applicant s own a dwelling?  Are  the applicant s U.S. \ncitizens or eligible non- U.S. citizens  as detailed  in Chapter 8?  If the applicant s are \nnot U.S. citizens , they must produce evidence per Agency guidelines to qualify  as \na non- U.S. citizen .  \n\u2022 Income (Chapter 9)  At the time of loan approval, is the household's adjusted \nincome below the applicable moderate -income limit? To determine eligibility for \nthe SFHGLP, the lender is responsible for documenting the income of all adult members of the applicant s\u2019 household (not just those who will be signatories to the ",

Current income limits are referenced  in Appendix 5, and can be located on \nthe USDA Income and Property E ligibility website at \nhttp://eligibility.sc.egov.usda.gov/eligibility/ , or by using the Agency\u2019s automated \nunderwriting system, GUS. \nIn addition to meeting a djusted annual  income requirements, the applicants must \nalso have sufficient repayment income and meet additional program requirements.  \nChapter 9 provides more detailed information about annual, adjusted, and repayment income. \n\u2022 Credit (Chapter 10)  Is the credit history consistent with program guidelines? \nThe applicants must have a credit history that demonstrates the ability and willingness to repay the loan.  GUS is unable to render an underwriting recommendation on supplemental credit reports.  These should be uploaded with \nthe application package. \n\u2022 Ratios (Chapter 11 ) Do the applicants\u2019 PITI (Principal, Interest, Taxes and \nInsurance) and total debt (TD) ratios fall at or below the limits established by the \nAgency?  Ratios are calculated using repayment income from applicants who will \nbe a party to the Promissory Note.   \n\u2022 Appraised Value/ Loan amount ( Chapter 12 ) Is the loan amount supported by \nthe appraisal\u2019s fair market value?  If there is not yet a current appraisal, is the loan amount expected to be supported by the appraisal?  \n\u2022 Site and Property (Chapter 12)  Does the property appear to be in an eligible \nrural area as designated by program guidelines?  If warranted, did Agency staff confirm that the property location was rural?  The Agency encourages lenders and those involved in the origination package to verify a property\u2019s eligibility on the Agency\u2019s property eligibility website .

Informing the Applicant  \nBefore request ing a loan guarantee, the lender should take the following steps to \nensure that applicant s have a general understanding of the SFHGLP. \n\u2022 Concept of a loan guarantee .  Describe to the applicants what a loan guarantee \nis, why it is used, and the benefits of a loan guarantee.  Benefits include, but are not limited to , no required down payment and a fixed interest rate . \n\u2022 Loan guarantee f ee (Chapter 16)  Inform the applicants of the upfront guarantee \nfee to be paid at loan closing.

Automated underwriting (AU) systems are an efficient, consistent, objective, and accurate method of mortgage underwriting compared with traditional manual methods.  GUS is a tool that helps evaluate the credit risk of the loan request.  It compliments but DOES NOT replace the considered judgment of experienced underwriters.   \nGUS incorporates applicant s\u2019 eligibility and underwriting requirements of this \nHandbook by utilizing a modified version of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) mortgage scorecard known as Technology Open to Approved Lenders (TOTAL), concurrently with a rules based engine.  GUS is accessed through a secure web -based \nautomated underwriting environment at https://usdalinc.sc.egov.usda.gov/\n.  GUS \nconsiders mortgage loan application data entered by the approved lender , credit \nrepository data, and income and property information to evaluate the potential applicant s\u2019 \nability to meet a proposed mortgage obligation. GUS evaluates select components in a mortgage loan application and provides a credit evaluation and underwriting recommendation within seconds.  GUS is not designed to evaluate the dependability of the applicants\u2019 income proposed for repayment.  This remains the underwriter\u2019s responsibility to determine prior to final submission.  Refer to Chapter 9 of this Handbook to determine adequate and dependable income for repayment ability.  Lenders \nare reminded that data entered in GUS must coincide with that of the lender\u2019s permanent \nloan file.  \nA. Functionality of GUS  \nIncorporated within the functionality of GUS are the following components: \nProperty and Income Eligibility  \n\u2022 The dwelling offered as collateral for the proposed mortgage loan is located in an \neligible rural area; and  ",

When modifications occur, loans remaining as a preliminary recommendation may not receive the same underwriting results upon a final submission. \nCredit Bureau Interface \n\u2022 GUS links with a number of credit providers nationwide.  Users may link to a full list of credit providers at \nhttps://singlefamily.fanniemae.com/credit- information -\nproviders .   \n\u2022 An interface occurs between GUS and the credit bureaus through a platform known as the Fannie Mae Credit Interface Service (CIS).

An attempt to \naccess information from all national credit repositories will occur, but GUS can complete its credit risk evaluation with information from only one repository. \n\u2022 New or re -issued credit can be pulled through GUS. \n\u2022 Credit reports pulled through GUS are valid for 120 days, unless the credit \nprovider\u2019s expiration is more restrictive .   \n\u2022 Lenders are not required to be a Fannie Mae subscriber or partner to utilize the \ncredit report interface in GUS.  \nB. Gaining Access to GUS  \nApproved lenders with active Lender Agreements must utilize GUS  as part of their \ncredit risk evaluation for all loan  types supported by GUS.  Lenders are  required to enter \ninto a User Agreement and obtain authorized access through the use of a Login.gov  \naccount and password.  The GUS Lender User Guides may be obtained at : \nhttps://www.rd.usda.gov/resources/usda- linc-training -resource -library/guaranteed -\nunderwriting -system .   \nC. Underwriting Guidance for Lenders \nGUS evaluates the overall creditworthiness of the applicants  based upon a number of \ncredit variables and, when combined with remaining functionalities of GUS, indicates a \nrecommended level of underwriting to determine a loan\u2019s eligibility for a SFHGLP guarantee.  GUS will conclude that the credit and capacity for repayment of the mortgage \nare acceptable or will refer the loan to the lender\u2019s underwriter for further consideration, review , and manual underwriting.   \nRegardless of the underwriting recommendation provided, the lender remains \naccountable for compliance with SFHGLP eligibility requirements, as well as any credit, capacity, and documentation requirements.  Applicants  should not be approved or denied \na SFHGLP guarantee solely on the basis of a risk assessment generated by GUS.    \nD. Compatible Loan Origination System (LOS) and Point of Sale (POS) Vendors  \n A file import feature is available to create or update an application in GUS. GUS \nallows XML files meeting requirements of the Desktop Underwriter \u00ae Specification  to be \nimported into the system. For additional guidance on file import requirements and the most recent version of the Desktop Underwriter\u00ae Specification permitted, the lender may refer to the GUS Lender User Guide, which can be found at: ",

Cash Reserves \nAlthough cash reserves after closing are not required for the SFHGLP, cash reserves \nare considered in the risk assessment provided by GUS.  When disclosing the assets of \napplicants on the \u201cAssets and Liabilities\u201d page of GUS, lenders have the responsibility to determine if the asset is liquid or readily converted to cash and can be done so absent retirement or job termination.  Assets such as 40l(k)s , IRAs, etc. may be included in the \nunderwriting analysis up to only 60 percent of the vested value.  Funds borrowed against these accounts may be used for loan closing but  are not to be considered as cash reserves.  \nGift funds  from any source will not be included in the cash reserves calculation in GUS .  \nCash reserves are used for the purpose of qualifying applicant s for a loan.  Cash to close \nremains the lender\u2019s responsibility to verify and document that applicant s have sufficient \nfunds to facilitate loan closing.  Documentation will be retained in the lender\u2019s permanent \nloan file.   \nAssets should never be overvalued as it affects the risk assessment provided by the \nautomated underwriting system  and misrepresents the file presented for a Conditional \nCommitment for Loan Note Guarantee .  Guidance on the calculation of reserves is \nexplained in Chapter 9.  Although assets must always be verified, in lieu of entering assets in GUS, the lender may underwrite to a more  conservative approach, entering a \nlesser amount (the amount to demonstrate the applicant has the required funds for closing \ncosts) or alternatively,  with no consideration of assets on the \u201cAssets and Liabilities\u201d \npage and underwriting recommendation.   \nAssets may also influence program eligible income.  Refer to Paragraph 9.4 of \nChapter 9 for additional information regarding assets and program eligible income.  \nF. Omitting Liabilities   \nIf a lender omits an adverse trade line when utilizing GUS and receives an Accept \nunderwriting recommendation, the applicants\u2019 explanation letter and supportive documentation of adverse trade lines will be retained by the lender.  The lender will indicate the justification for the omission in the \u201c If Omit, please specify \u201d section of the \n\u201cAsset and Liabilities\u201d page.  \nG.

Examples of these obligations include, but are not limited to , installment loans, revolving credit lines, real estate taxes, final homeowner\u2019s \ninsurance premiums, etc.  Loan files that have received a Conditional Commitment for Loan Note Guarantee do not require updated underwriting or resubmission of GUS when the cu mulative total of obligations increase , but do not exceed the established thresholds.  \nThis tolerance threshold applies to situations where an increase in monthly debt provided on the loan application at time of Conditional Commitment differs from the amou nt \nrecorded at loan closing.  \nTax and Insurance Escrows:  Approved lenders must ensure that an accurate \nestimate for the property tax/ insurance component of the  applicants\u2019 monthly mortgage \npayment is utilized when submitting loan applications to the Agency. The threshold policy should not be construed to allow lender manipulation of escrow variables to obtain approvals. Care must be taken to assu me a realistic estimate is used for computing the \nmonthly escrowed amount.  For existing properties, the escrowed amount for rea l estate \ntaxes is based on the actual taxes assessed .  For new construction, tax estimates must be \nbased on the land and completed improvements, not just on the land value (i.e. value of both the property and the completed dwelling).  The lender may contact the taxing authority which has jurisdiction  over the property to obtain an estimate of the taxes to be \nassessed for newly constructed homes.  The Agency reserves the right to request and review files from lenders that are suspected of purposely underestimating tax and insurance payments in order to secure a commitment or loan guarantee. \nIncome:   \n Verification of income must be obtained prior to final submission.  \nTherefore,  data entered in GUS must be supported with verifying documentation of \nincome in the lender\u2019s permanent loan file.  Income must be verified  and documented  in \naccordance with Chapter 9 of this Hand book. \nLiquid Assets:   Asset data reflected in GUS must be supported by verification \ndocumentation.  The final submission will reflect the verified amount.  Guidance regarding verifying assets can be found in Attachment 9 -A.   \nH.

GUS Underwriting Recommendations  \nBased on the analysis of credit, capacity , and other loan characteristics, GUS will \nrender an underwriting recommendation.  The recommendation is based upon the dat a \nentered in GUS with the representation from the lender that the data is true, complete , \naccurate, and  verified .  The following represent possible underwriting recommendations \nwith guidance on documentation to be submitted to the Agency when requesting a Conditional Commitment for Loan Note Guarantee.  \nACCEPT/ELIGIBLE Underwriting Recommendation  \nMinimal documentation provisions apply to GUS underwriting recommendations that \nreceive an Accept , unless a quality control message on the GUS Underwriting Findings \nReport indicates a n Accept with Full  Documentation file is required.  A quality control \nmessage requiring a full documentation file will appear on the GUS Underwriting Findings Report upon final submission. Lenders should submit full additional \ndocumentation files as noted in Attachment 15-A, Loan Origination Checklist, for files for that receive GUS underwriting recommendations of Accept with Full Documentation.   \nAccurate data is the responsibility of the approved lender.  By submitting the \nmortgage loan application request through GUS as a final submission , the lender is \nrepresenting that the data input is true, complete, accurate, and verified .  Underwriting is \nthe responsibility of the approved lender.  Lenders are required to review the results of \nthe GUS  Underwriting F indings Report  and credit reports.  If necessary, make data \nchanges and resubmit the loan to GUS.

This random selection is for quality control purposes.  A \nmessage on the lender\u2019s final pass of underwriting will confirm when a full documentation file is required.  Full file documentation reviews are to confirm the data input into the GUS file accurately reflects that of the lender\u2019s file and documentation.  \nMortgage loan documents will be delivered electronically through GUS .

Typical reasons for an Accept/Ineligible  recommendation may include:  \n\u2022 Property is not located in a rural area  \n\u2022 Income exceeds Agency guidelines \n\u2022 Non-owner occupied transaction  \nLoans that receive a recommendation of Accept/Ineligible  may still be eligible for a \nSFHGLP  loan guarantee.  To achieve eligibility, the lender\u2019s underwriter should analyze \nthe findings report and determine the basis for the ineligibility and determine if the reason for ineligibility can be resolved in order to comply with Agency guidelines.  Issues that caused the loan to be ineligible may be resubmitted to obtain an updated underwriting recommendation. \nREFER or REFER WITH CAUTION Underwriting Recommendation  \nGUS loans receiving an underwriting recommendation of Refer or Refer with Caution \nwill require  the lender\u2019s underwriter to perform a manual underwriting evaluation of the \nmortgage loan application to determine if applicants are  creditworthy in accordance with \nSFHGLP credit policies and guidelines.

If the lender is not willing to make the \nloan without a guarantee and wishes to request a guarantee, the  required loan terms for all \nloans guaranteed under the program are described below. \nA.

The \npromissory note must show regular monthly payments generally pa yable on the first day \nof the month. \nB. Interest Rate \nThe lender and the borrower are free to negotiate any mutually acceptable fixed \ninterest rate.  The interest rate should be locked by the time of loan settlement.  In the \nevent the interest rate is not locked at the time Form RD 3555- 18 is issued, and the \ninterest rate increases between the time of issuance of Form RD  3555-18 and loan \nclosing, the lender will note the change when submitting the lo an closing package and \nsupport the increase in interest rate with modified loan applic ation documents.

Repayment  income  calculations  often  differ from \nthe calculation of annual and adjusted annual income.  \n    \nRepayment  income  is the stable and dependable  income  of the applicants  who will be \nparties to the note. Co- signers and non- occupant co -borrowers are not permitted for a \nguaranteed loan transaction. \n \n9.8 STABLE AND DEPENDABLE INCOME  [7 CFR  3555.152(a)]  \n \n7 CFR 3555.152(a)  and Attachment  9-A assist  lenders  in reviewing  income types. \nThe following guidance  also assists lenders  to consider  repayment  income  sources:  \n \n\u2022 The income  source  must  be documented.  \n \n\u2022 There  must  be evidence  to support  the historical receipt  of earnings.  \n \n\u2022 Establish  the likelihood of its continuance  for at least 3 years  into the mortgage.  \n \n\u2022 Analyze any gaps in employment to make a final determination of stable and dependable income. The Agency does not impose specific criteria regarding \nwhen a gap in employment is acceptable. It is the approved lender\u2019s \nresponsibility  to analyze  the complete  employment  history  to determine  stable and \ndependable income.  \n \n\u2022 Caution should be utilized  for applicants  that have  documented declining wages or \nearnings. Lenders must ensure repayment income is not inflated/overstated. \n \n\u2022 Caution should be utilized  for applicants  that have  a documented sharp  increase in \nearnings. A sharp increase in earnings is defined as a 20 percent or greater variance in income from the previous 12 months. Lenders must determine if an increase is supported and logical. Examples include, but are not limited to, a promotion w ith the current employer, documented pay raise, income trend \nanalysis for overtime, bonus, commission, seasonal employees, etc.  \n \n\u2022 Caution should be utilized for applicants that have a documented decrease in earnings. A documented  decrease in earnings  is defined  as a 20 percent  or greater  \nvariance in income from the previous 12 months. Lenders must determine if the ",

When the business was closed;  2. Why the  business was closed; 3.  How the business was closed; and \n4. Evidence, satisfactory  to the lender, to support  the closure  of the business.  \n \nREMINDER: Approved lenders are responsible for their underwriting decisions, \nwhich includes the determination of stable and dependable income. Loans that default \nwithin 60 months of the date the Loan Note Guarantee is issued may result in indemnification  from the approved lender  to USDA due to unauthorized underwriting per \n7 CFR 3555, HB -1-3555, and additional published USDA guidance.  \n \n9.9 AGENCY REVIEW  OF REPAYMENT INCOME  \n \nThe Agency will recalculate the lender\u2019s determination of repayment income, as a \nquality control step, when the repayment ratios are within 10 percent of the published debt ratio threshold of 7 CFR 3555.151(h).  The Agency review is only required for manually underwritten loans, defined as application types that are not supported by GUS and applications submitted to GUS that have received an underwriting recommendation of Refer or Refer with Caution.  \n \nIf the Agency\u2019s calculation does not agree with the repayment income calculation of \nthe lender, the Agency will contact the approved lender to review the results and determine the appropriate calculation. This action will strengthen the oversight procedure s to verify  compliance  with regulatory  requirements. The Agency will complete \nAttachment  9-F, Worksheet  for Documenting Eligible  Household and Repayment  Income , \nto record their calculation, which will then be uploaded to the Electronic Customer File (ECF).  \n \n9.10 OPTIONAL DOCUMENTATION OF INCOME FORMS  \n \nAttachment 9 -G of this Chapter provides optional verification forms for the lender\u2019s",

Dependents  are \nKathy, Janet, and Cynthia.  \nChild  Care  Deduction \n\u2022 Child  care expenses  are permitted  for the care of a foster  child  but must not exceed  the amount  earned  by the family  \nmember enabled to work.  \n\u2022 Child  care expenses  are not permitted  if another  adult  household member  is available  to care for the child.  In this example,  it \nis assumed there are no adult household members available to care for the child.  \n\u2022 Since  the cost of child  care does not exceed  an adult  household member\u2019s  monthly  earnings,  the full amount  of the child  care may \nbe deducted.  \n \nElderly  or Disabled  Household  Deduction \n\u2022 Cynthia,  a household member,  is 67. But she is not an applicant  on the loan,  therefore  no elderly  family  deduction is allowed.  \n \nMed\nical Expense  Deduction \n\u2022 Family  medical  expenses  cannot  be deducted  since  this is not an elderly  or disabled  household as defined  in 7 CFR 3555.152(c).  \nDisability  Assistance Expenses  \n\u2022 No disability  assistance expenses  were  claimed.  To be allowed  a deduction,  the expenses  would  have  to be necessary  to enable \na family member to work.  \nRepayment  Income: Calculate  the income  utilized  to repay  the loan.  Consider  only income from parties  to the note \nthat is determined to be stable and dependable per 7 CFR 3555.152(a).  \nDavid and Betsy are parties to the note.  David has worked the last two years earning $1,250 per week or $65,000 annually.  Betsy \nhas made  $15.50/hour  and worked  20 hours  per week  for the past five years  consistently.  Betsy  receives  child  support for Kathy,  paid \nthrough the court at $100 a month, or $1,200 annually. She has received support consistently for the past three years. Kathy is 14.  \nDavid and Betsy  have  cared  for foster  children  for the past three  years.  Chris  Doe is 8 years  of age. The county pays $800.00  per \nmonth, or $9,600 annually to the household to care for the foster child. Foster care is not a source of income that is eligible for \nrepayment income.  \n\u2022 David:  $65,000  historical employment  income  divided  by 12 = $5,416.67  \n\u2022 Betsy:  $16,120  historical employment  income  divided by 12 = $1,343.33  \n\u2022 Betsy:  $1,200 historical child  support income  divided  by 12 = $100.00 [3-year continuance  since  Kathy  is 14] \n\u2022 Total stable  and dependable  income  in accordance  with 7 CFR  3555.152(a)  = $6,860.00/month  ",

Lenders \nmay use the Fannie Mae forms or any documentation that provides the same information. \nRegardless  of the analysis  method used, and the  documentation prepared  by the lender,  the loan \nfile must contain clear and sufficient support for the lender\u2019s decision regarding  the viability of \nthe business and loan approval.  \n \nA. Individual  Tax Returns (IRS  Form  1040)  \n \nThe amount shown on the IRS Form 1040 as \u201cadjusted gross income\u201d must be either \nincreased  or decreased  based  on the lender\u2019s  analysis  of the individual  tax returns  and any \nrelated tax schedules. Particular attention must be paid to:  \n \n\u2022 Wages, salaries,  tips. If an amount  is shown here,  this may indicate the individual  is \na salaried employee of a corporation or has other sources of income. It may also \nindicate the spouse is employed, in which case the income must be subtracted from the adjusted gross income in the analysis.\n \n\u2022 Business income or loss (from Schedule C) . The sole proprietorship income \ncalculated  on Schedule  C is business  income. Depreciation  or depletion may be added \nback to adjusted gross income.  \n\u2022 Rents,  royalties,  partnerships,  etc. (from Schedule  E). Any income  received  from \nrental properties or royalties may be used as income after adding back any depreciation shown on Schedule E.\n \n\u2022 Capital  gain or loss (from Schedule  D). This is generally  a one-time transaction  and \nshould not be considered  in determining repayment income.  However, if the business \nhas a constant turnover of assets resulting in gains or losses, the capital gain or loss may be considered in determining the income provided the applicant s have at least \ntwo years\u2019 tax returns evidencing capital gains. An example would include an individual who purchases old houses, remodels them, and sells them for a profit.\n \n \n\u2022 Interest  and dividend income  (from Schedule  B). This income, both taxable  and \ntax- exempt, may be added back to the adjusted gross income only if it has been \nreceived for the past two years and is expected to continue. If the interest -bearing \nasset will be liquidated as a source of the cash investment, the lender must adjust accordingly.\n ",
  "page_148": "HB-1-3555  \nAttachment  9-E \nPage 2 of 3   \n \u2022 Farm  income  or loss (from  Schedule  F). Any depreciation  shown on Schedule  F \nmay be added back to the adjusted gross income.  \n \n\u2022 IRA distributions,  pensions  and annuities,  and social  security  benefits . The non- \ntaxable  portion of these items  may  be added back  to the adjusted gross  income  if the \nincome is expected to continue for the first three years of the mortgage.  \n \n\u2022 Adjustments to income.  Certain  adjustments to  income shown on the IRS Form \n1040 may be added back  to the adjusted  gross  income.  Among these are IRA and \nKeogh retirement deductions, penalties on early withdrawal of savings, health \ninsurance deductions, and alimony payments.  \n \n\u2022 Employee  business  expenses.  These  are actual  cash expenses  that must  be deducted \nfrom the applicant\u2019s adjusted gross income, if applicable.  \n \nB. U.S. Corporate  Income Tax Returns  (IRS  Form  1120)  \n \nCorporations are state chartered businesses owned by their stockholders.  Compensation \nto its officers, generally in proportion to the percentage of ownership, is shown on the \ncorporate tax returns and will appear on individual tax returns. If the applicant\u2019s  percentage \nof ownership is not shown, it must be separately obtained from the corporation\u2019s accountant with evidence the applicant s have  the right  to those  funds. Once  the adjusted business  income  \nis determined, it is to be multiplied by the applicant\u2019s  percentage of ownership in the \nbusiness.  \n \nIn analyzing  the corporate  tax returns,  lenders  must  adjust  for the following: \n \n\u2022 Depreciation  and depletion . The corporation\u2019s  depreciation  and depletion  must  be \nadded back to after -tax income.  \n \n\u2022 Taxable  income . This is the corporation\u2019s  net income  before  federal  taxes.  It must  be \nreduced by the tax liability. \n \n\u2022 Fiscal  year  versus calendar  year . If the  corporation operates  on a  fiscal  year that is \ndifferent from the calendar year, an adjustment must be made by the lender to relate \ncorporate income to the individual tax return.  \n \n\u2022 Cash  withdrawals . The applicant\u2019s  withdrawal  of cash from  the corporation may \nhave a severe negative impact on the corporation\u2019s ability to continue operating.  \n \nC. \u201cS\u201d Corporation  Tax Returns  \n \nAn \u201cS\u201d corporation is generally a small, start -up business, with gains and losses passed \nonto stockholders  in proportion  to each stockholder\u2019s  percentage  of business ownership. The \nincome for the owners comes from W -2 wages and is taxed at the individual rate.  \n \nThe \u201ccompensation of officers\u201d line on the IRS Form 1120- S is transferred to the \napplicant\u2019s  IRS Form  1040. Both  depreciation  and depletion may be added back  to income  in \n \n \n ",

However, income must also be deducted \nproportionately by the total obligations  payable  by the corporation in less than one year.  The \napplicant\u2019s withdrawal of cash from the corporation may have a severe negative impact on the corporation\u2019s ability to continue operating which must be considered in the analysis. \n \nD. Partnership  Tax Returns  \n \nA partnership is formed when two or more individuals form a business and share in \nprofits,  losses,  and responsibility  for running the company. Each  partnership  pays taxes on \nhis or her proportionate share of the partnership income.  \n \nBoth  general  and limited  partnerships  report  income  on the IRS Form  1065, U.S. Return \nof Partnership Income , which must be reviewed by the lender to assess the viability of the \nbusiness. The partner\u2019s share of income is carried over to Schedule E of IRS Form 1040. Both depreciation and depletion may be added back to income in proportion to the applicant\u2019s share of income. However, income must also be deducted proportionately by the total obligations  payable  by the partnership  in less than one year.  The applicant\u2019s  withdrawal \nof cash from the partnership may have a severe negative impact on the partnership\u2019s ability to continue operating that must be considered in the analysis. \n \nE. LLC  Corporation  Tax Returns  \n \nA limited liability corporation (LLC) can be formed by one or more individuals. Owners \nin an LLC are referred to as members. A member of an LLC normally has at risk, only his or her share of capital  paid into the business.  Members are not personally  liable  for the debts  of \nthe LLC. There are three ways in which an LLC is taxed:  \n \n\u2022 Single -owner LLC. LLC owners are taxed on business profits each year on their \nindividual  income  tax returns. The IRS treats  the LLC  as a sole proprietorship. Profits \nare reported on Schedule C of an individual 1040 tax return.  \n \n\u2022 LLCs . The IRS treats the LLC as a partnership. The LLC prepares and files IRS  \nForm 1065, U.S. Return of Partnership Income, each year. LLC profits are allocated \nto each of the owners according to the profit -sharing arrangement set up in the LLC \noperating agreement.  Each  owner  is given a Schedule  K-1, which shows  each owner\u2019s \nshare of LLC income. The owner then reports and pays taxes on this income on the owner\u2019s 1040 income tax return.  \n \n\u2022 Check -the-Box Corporate  Tax Treatment . Under  these rules,  any eligible  business \ncan elect to be taxed as a corporation by filing IRS Form 8832, Entity Classification Election , and checking the corporate income tax treatment box on the form. After \nmaking this election, profits kept in the business are taxed at the separate income tax rates that apply to corporations.  ",

A delinquent Federal debt identified on the credit report, public records, or equivalent, must be investigated by the lender to determine if the debt is valid, paid in full, or the credito r has issued a release of liability.  \nAn applicant with a delinquent non -tax Federal debt is ineligible for a guaranteed loan.    \nCREDIT SCORES AND VALIDATION   \nA credit score is a statistical number that evaluates an applicant\u2019s creditworthiness based on their credit \nhistory.  The credit score considers payment history, amounts owed, percentage of credit used, length of credit history, types of credit, and newly acquired credit.   \n GUS Loans:  \nGUS will determine the acceptable credit score to be used for the underwriting recommendation for Accept, Refer, and Refer with Caution recommendations.      \n GUS Accept /Accept with Full Documentation F iles: \nNo credit score validation is  required .   \n Manually Underwritten Loans  and Loan T ypes N ot Supported by GUS  (Manually Submitted):  \nCredit score validation is required.    \n \nLenders must select the middle of three scores, the lower of two (a repeating score may be used), or the single reported score.  A credit report with no score must refer to non-\ntraditional tradeline requirements.         \n Validate Credit Score : \nGUS Refer, Refer with Caution,  Manually Underwritten , and Loan Types Not Supported by GUS \n(Manually Submitted) : \nOne applicant whose income and/or assets is used to originate the loan must have a validated credit score.  This applicant must have two tradelines on the credit report that have been/were/are open for 12 months based on the date the account was opened as stated on the credit report.  A validated score does not indicate the applicant has an acceptable credit history.  A validated score confirms that one applicant has \nan eligible minimum credit history.  \n ",

Consider a non- traditional credit history. \nTradelines with at least a 12 month history on the credit report may be combined with non-\ntraditional credit to meet the cumulative tradeline number requirement for a non- traditional credit \nhistory.

A hard inquiry is requested \nwhen an applicant is seeking credit and completes a credit application.  Hard inquiries are typically listed on the credit report and factored into the credit score.  A soft inquiry is not included on the credit report \nand does not result in a new credit/debt.  Soft inquiries may include a free annual credit report, companies developing marketing lists, prequalification offers, etc.    \n Inquiries for credit made by the applicant(s) 90 days before the date of the credit report must be investigated to determine if new credit accounts were opened.

Rural Area  Definition  \n \nAn area\u2019s rural designation is determined by the Agency and may be changed as a \nresult of a periodic review or after the decennial census of population. The Agency conducts reviews every five years to identify areas that no longer qualify as rural. In areas experiencing rapid growth, and in eligible communities within Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), reviews take place every three years. Public notification will be given at \nleast 30 days before the date of the final determination in order to give inte rested parties \nan adequate chance to comment. Refer to section 3550.10 of 7 CFR  3550 and HB -1-3550 \nChapter 5 for additional information regarding rural area designations.  \n \n ",

Outbuildings such as storage sheds and non- commercial workshops are permitted \nif they are not used primarily for an income producing, agricultural, farming , or \ncommercial enterprise. A minimal income -producing activity, such as maintaining \na garden that generates a small amount of additional i ncome, does not violate this \nrequirement. Home -based operations such as childcare, product sales, or craft \nproduction that do not require specific commercial real estate features are not \nrestricted.  \n \n\u2022 Accessory Dwelling Unit.  An Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) refers to a \nhabitable living unit, within, or detached from a single f amily dwelling, which \ntogether constitute a single interest in real estate.

D esign features such as \nconverted portions of existing homes that include a kitchenette or additional \nattached living area (e.g., bedroom and/or bathroom) without a separate address or  \nindependent utilities (e.g., water, gas, electricity) are not restricted, provided they function in support of only  the household members.  ADUs which function in \nsupport of the household members, such as multigenerational households, are \nconsistent with the objective of this program,  however those designed to create a \npotential rental income stream are not.  The appraiser will determine if the ADU \nrepresents a second single family housing dwelling unit. The appraiser must  \ndocument the highest and best use considering all property characteristics , \nincluding the status of the utilities if they are separate, when making this \ndetermination. The appraiser will include their evaluation in the site analysis and highest and best use section of the appraisal report, as applicable.  \n \n\u2022 Income- Producing Land.

No less than \nthree comparable sales will be used unless the appraiser provides documentation \nthat such comparable sales are not available. The appraiser must use their \nknowledge of the area and apply good judgment in the selection of comparable sales that are the best indicators of value for the subject  property. \n \n\u2022 The appraiser will determine if the cost approach is required. For example, the property is unique, has specialized improvements, is new manufactured housing, or if the client requests the cost approach to be completed, then the appraiser will identify the  source of the cost estimates and will comment on the methodology \nused to estimate depreciation, effective age, and remaining economic  \nlife. \n \n\u2022 The income approach is only required if the appraiser determines that it is necessary to develop credible assignment  results.  \n \n\u2022 An appraisal prepared for REO purposes, loan servicing consideration, or any \nother purpose other than the guaranteed purchase or refinance transaction is ",

Types of Agency  Reviews  \n \nThere are three types of reviews for appraisals : \u201cAdministrative, \u201d \u201cTechnical Desk ,\u201d \nand \u201c Technical Field. \u201d An administrative review will be completed for all transactions \ninvolving the submittal of an appraisal report. A sufficient number of technical desk and \ntechnical field reviews will be completed to ensure the Agency is getting quality appraisals for the Guaranteed Loan Program. An explanation of the review types are as \nfollows:  \n \n1. Administrative  Reviews  \n \nAdministrative reviews are performed by the Agency loan approval official or \nqualified designee on all appraisals prior to issuance of the Conditional Commitment. This review determines if there are inconsistencies in the appraisal report that may have to be addressed, or if a technical review should be completed by the Agency staff appraiser prior to issuance of the Loan Note Guarantee. Indicators that a technical review may be required will be documented on Form RD  1922- 15. \n \n\u2022 Administrative reviews are completed by the Agency on Form RD 1922- 15. \nThis form will be signed, dated, and retained in the Agency file for uploading. This review should be completed prior to issuance of the Conditional  \nCommitment. \n \n\u2022 If there is a deficiency with an appraisal, the loan approval official should \ncommunicate the deficiency to the lender. These deficiencies should include \nitems that affect loan security, value conclusions, or unacceptable property \nconditions.  \n \n2. Technical Desk  Reviews  \n \nA technical  desk review is performed to determine whether the appraisal was \ncomplete, was clearly reasoned, and had adequate support for the conclusion of value. Technical reviews are performed by the Agency Appraiser. Technical reviews completed by Agency appraisers must  follow current USPAP  guidelines . \n \n\u2022 Technical desk reviews may be documented in any format that complies with \nUSPAP and is acceptable for use by RD. Technical reviews should be selected \nin a random method. The percent of files randomly selected will be set by the direction of the SFHGL P.  \n \n ",

Technical desk review s of appraisals received by \n \nthe A gency provide a method of internal control by the appraisal review staff and \nensure that appraisals received by the Agency are in compliance with USPAP and Agency regulations.  A  Director of the OPD, or designated supervisory staff , will \nsupport completion of technical desk reviews in coordination with PSS to achieve the appraisal quality control requirements of the  Agency. \n A technical review may also be requested by OPD staff when problems are \ndetected on the administrative review that cannot or will not be addressed by the submitting lender or original appraiser.  These problems must be significant and result in an appraisa l which does not support the value conclusion. OPD staff will \ndocument the nature of their concerns on Form RD 1922- 15. The appraisal will then \nbe forwarded to the Appraisal Services Branch for a technical and/or field review prior to approval of the  loan. \n \n3. Technical Field  Reviews \n \nField reviews will involve on -site visits to the subject property and the \ncomparable properties used in the report. Field reviews are completed by Agency Appraisal staff on a random, spot -check basis to determine if the appraiser has \nfollowed accepted appraisal techniques and arrived at a logical conclusion.  \n \n\u2022 USPAP Standard 3 Review is used for technical field reviews. The reviewer \nmay use any reporting format that complies with USPAP and is acceptable for \nuse by RD.

A copy of a title report, retained in the lender\u2019s loan file, may be used to \nevidence the easement. Private streets must have a permanently recorded easement or be owned and maintained by a HOA.  All evidence of recorded easements or maintenance agreements must be reviewed and approved by the approved lender\u2019s underwriter a nd \ndocumented in the lender\u2019s permanent loan file. \nB. Maintenance  \n \nStreets and roads must be hard surfaced or all -weather surfaced. An all -weather \nsurface is a road surface over which emergency and the area\u2019s typical passenger vehicles \ncan always pass. A publicly maintained road is automatically assumed to meet this \nrequirement. If a  HOA is responsible for maintaining streets and roads, it must meet the \ncriteria set forth by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), or U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).",

The property must be free to the maximum extent possible  of any known \nhazards that may have adverse effects on the health and safety of the occupants.

The appraiser is required to note readily observable conditions. If the lender knows or is informed by another party of a potential hazard, the information must be disclosed to the appraiser. \nLenders must follow up on all potential environmental hazards identified by an appraiser to determine the nature and scope of the problem, and the impact the problem is likely to have on the property\u2019s value. If potential environmental haza rds are noted, the lender \nmust carefully document the suspected problem and the findings of its investigation.  \n \nIf the lender\u2019s investigation reveals an environmental hazard does exist, the lender \nmust ensure the hazard is mitigated before requesting the loan guarantee.  \n \n \n \nB.

The approved lender must submit the construction contract executed by the applicant and builder with each single -close request.  \n \n12.20 LOAN CLOSING  \n \nStandard industry closing documents are utilized when closing a single -close loan.  \nThe lender is responsible for ensuring all applicable security documents, including a valid \nand enforceable Note, are complete d at loan closing. The lender is responsible for any \nstate specific construction related requirements that may influence the validity of the first lien or the construction disbursement process. The date of closing will be the date the interim construction loan is closed. These construction documents m ay be in any form \nacceptable to the lender.  \n At closing, the term of the loan is for thirty years.  During construction, interest on \nthe construction loan is payable monthly, either directly from the borrower or indirectly \ndrawn from an established reserve account. If the lender elects not to establish a reserve account and the borrower will pay these expenses directly, clear documentation that they possess the ability to do so must be demonstrated in the application package.

The established PITI reserve account will then be \nutilized to make t he monthly loan payments on the amortized loan during the \nconstruction period. This alleviates the requirement for a loan modification or reamortization at the end of the construction period and allows the lender to  \nsecuritize the loan prior to the completion of construction.

Funds that remain in the \ncontingency reserve account after the completion of construction may be utilized for an \neligible loan purpose or applied to the principal balance of the permanent loan. \n \n12.26 MORTGAGE FILE DOCUMENTATION  \n \nThe lender\u2019s permanent loan  file must contain the following information to support \nthe single close transaction, in addition to documentation outlined in this Handbook:  \n \n\u2022 Sufficient documentation to validate the actual cost to construct the subject home  \n(for example, purchase contracts with the builder, Construction Loan Agreement, \nplans and specifications, receipts, invoices, lien waivers,  etc.);  \n \n\u2022 All closing disclosures and closing documents executed by all parties to the \ntransaction and evidencing all costs to the homebuyer and property seller at the time of loan  closing;  \n \n\u2022 A final title insurance policy endorsement ensuring the lender remains in a first lien position and that no junior liens exist against the  property ;\n \n \n\u2022 All canceled checks, paid receipts, draw requests, lien waivers, change orders, title endorsements, etc. for all property -related requirements for new  construction;  \n \n\u2022 The appraiser\u2019s certificate of completion and a photograph of the completed ",

The loan will \nbe serviced in accordance with Chapters 18 through 20 of this Handbook, as applicable. \n \n12.28 REHABILITATION AND REPAIR WITH PURCHASE OF  EXISTING \nDWELLINGS  \n \nThe rehabilitation and repair feature of the SFHGLP allows borrowers to finance the \ncost of repairs to improve an existing dwelling at the time of purchase. The maximum loan amount cannot exceed the cost of acquisition plus the cost of repairs up to the as - \nimproved market value, plus the guarantee fee, if financed. The borrower obtains one loan at a fixed interest rate to finance both the acquisition and the rehabilitation of the property. The loan is guaranteed after the loan has closed, prior to the completion of the repairs, which minimizes the risk to the lender. In GUS, the lender will select Purchase as the loan purpose type on the Loan and Property Information page. On the Lender Loan Information page, the lender will identify the transaction as Renovation, Construction-\nConversion/Construction- to-Permanent  and select the Single -Closing radio button.  On \nthe Additional Data page, \u201cPurchase is\u201d field equals Existing .  \n \nUnless otherwise specified, the rehabilitation and repair construction loan process \nshould be closed and managed following the same procedures described in the single - \nclose feature for new construction.  \n  Lenders may utilize Attachment 12 -E, Repair Escrow and Rehabilitation & Repair \nwith Purchase Comparison, when determining how repairs or  rehabilitation to properties \nmay be financed. \n \nA. Type of  Loans  \n \n1. Non-Structural Repairs up to  $75,000 \n \nThis feature allows borrowers to finance up to $75 ,000 for repairs such as those \nidentified by a home inspector or appraiser. There is no required minimum repair amount. The repairs must be non- structural, and the home must be considered \nhabitable within 30 days  of closing to be eligible for this feature. Since the dwelling  \nwill be habitable  within  30 days of closing, the loan is not eligible for reserve \naccounts for PITI payments during the construction period. The timeframe for the",

Section 1 of this Chapter deals with processing requirements for community \nland trusts , properties with restrictions on resale price,  leasehold  estates, Native American \nrestricted land , and loans on Hawaiian Home Lands . Section 2 describes the specific \nprocessing requirements for loans made on manufactured homes.  Section 3 outlines loan \nprocessing requirements for modular housing.      \nSECTION 1:  SPECIAL FORMS OF OWNERSHIP  \n13.2 OVERVIEW  \nThis section discusses processing requirements for guaranteed loans for dwellings \nthat fall under special ownership  types : Community land trusts , properties with \nrestrictions on resale price, leasehold estates, Native American restricted land, and loans \non Hawaiian Home Lands .  Unless otherwise indicated in this section, the same basic \nrequirements for loan guarantee approval discussed elsewhere in this H andbook applies \nto these loans.   \n13.3 LOANS FOR UNITS IN A COMMUNITY LAND TRUST [7 CFR 3555.206]  \nLoans to finance the purchase of dwellings located on land owned by a community \nland trust may be guaranteed if the conditions described in this paragraph are met, and if \nthe applicant s and the property otherwise meet the requirements outlined in this \nHandbook.  \nA. Definition  \nA community land trust is defined as a private non profit community housing \ndevelopment organization that owns and leases land at affordable prices.  A community land trust sells the property improvements (i.e., buildings, streets, sewers) that normally increase the land\u2019s value, but leases the land under a long- term ground lease to low - and \nmoderate -income households.  The organization must:  \n\u2022 Be organized under S tate or local laws.  \n\u2022 Have no part of its net earnings benefiting any member, founder, contributor, or individual.  ",

Protection of Lender Rights and Lien Position \nThe relevant legal documents must contain language that ensures all restrictions \nrelating to community land trusts will automatically and permanently terminate upon \nforeclosure or lender acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure.  Language that merely subordinates the restrictions to the mortgage is not sufficient.  The restrictions also cannot \nbe forced upon subsequent purchasers following resale by the lender.  \n ",

The c ommunity \nland t rust must then complete the purchase of the home within sixty (60) days of having \ngiven written notice of its intent to purchase. If the c ommunity l and trust does not \ncomplete the purchase within this 60 -day period, the Lender shall be free to sell the h ome \nto another entity . \nC. Appraisals  \nA property located on a site owned by a community land trust must be appraised as a \nleasehold interest.   \nD. Title Policy  \nThe leasehold estate must constitute real property, be subject to the mortgage lien, \nand be insured by a title insurance policy. Refer to title insurance policy requirements \noutlined in Chapter 16 of this H andbook. \n13.4 RESTRICTIONS ON RESALE PRICE  \nRestrictions on the resale price of the property or recapture of equity are permitted.

By releasing the funds, the Agency can reallocate them to deserving applic ants \nand facilitate the loan guarantee process efficiently.  Some common reasons for withdrawing a loan guarantee request are: \n\u2022 Lender\u2019s  rejection of the borrower\u2019s application;  \n\u2022 Change in property; or  \n\u2022 Choice of a loan program other than the SFHGLP . \n14.6 AGENCY ACTION \u2013 REQUESTING FUNDS FROM THE NATIONAL OFFICE \nRESERVE  \nFunds may be retained by the National Office during a fiscal year  to meet program \nneeds or Agency objective.

The permanent loan file must contain verified documentation  that supports \nhousehold eligibility for the S ingle Family Housing Guaranteed Loan Program  \n(SFHGLP) and the lender\u2019s approval of  the loan request.   \nLenders are not authorized to close loans prior to the issuance of the Conditional \nCommitment.

This guidance is \nlimited to lenders.  Agency staff will continue to follow internal policy.  \n7 CFR 3555 does not prohibit or consent to electronic signatures.  L enders may use \nelectronic signatures when  the lender perfects and maintains a first lien position, an \nenforceable promissory note, and meet s all other agency requirements.   This includes \nelectronic promissory notes (eNotes), deed of trust , and other documents relevant to the \nloan transaction.  Lenders should be familiar with the securitization requirements of government sponsored enterprises (GSE), such as Ginni e Mae, regarding the \ntransfer ability of eNotes.   \nLenders who choose to accept electronic signatures must meet the standards and \nrequirements set forth in the E -Sign Act, as well as all other applicable federal and state \nregulations and guidelines.

The lender\u2019s failure to collect on the promissory note or enforce the security instrument because of its electronic signature will be treated as negligent serv icing under \nSFHGLP regulations.  \n Failure to comply with any Federal statute or regulation could result in the denial of a \nloan guarantee or claim, withdrawal of lending authority, and/or debarment from Federal programs.  \n \n15.5 AGENCY REVIEW OF APPLICATION PACKAGE  \nThe Agency\u2019s automated  system will track the date and time the application package \nis received.

Agency Review of Lender\u2019s Underwriting Decisions  \nIt is the approved lender \u2019s responsibility to underwrite loans , however, under limited  \ncircumstances, the Agency may determine that a more thorough review of the lender\u2019s \nsubmission should be performed.  The Agency must notify the lender in writing of the \nadditional review .  The Agency may  review the lender\u2019s underwriting decisions under the \nfollowing circumstances : \n1.   Lenders who are new  to the program  \nWhen a new lender is approved for participation in the program, the initial  \napplication submissions  will receive a thorough Agency review, including a review of \nthe lender\u2019s underwriting decisions.  The purpose of these reviews is to provide \ntraining and ensure that the lender has a complete and accurate understanding of the \nAgency\u2019s requirements .  The Agency will continue to review new lender \nunderwriting decisions until the Agency is confident that the lender is performing \nsatisfactorily.  Additional training is provided when incomplete or deficient packages are received during initial submission.  \n2.   Lenders that submit incomplete or inaccurate applications \nIf a lender submits incomplete applications or applications  with inaccurate \ninformation , the Agency may choose to review the lender\u2019s underwriting to ensure \nthat the y understand the Agency\u2019s requirements.  Thorough review s will continue \nuntil the lender demonstrates their ability to submit complete and accurate application \npackages on a regular basis.  \n ",

The Request for a Loan Guarantee is Approved  \nIf the loan file meets Agency requirements , the lender will receive an email with  a \nlink to view Form RD 3555- 18/18E, Conditional Commitment for Single Family Housing \nLoan Guarantee . The Conditional Commitment establishes conditions for issuing the \nLoan N ote G uarantee.   This form will also be available under the Documents  section  of \nthe GUS system once it has been issued by the Agency.  In order to receive the Loan \nNote Guarantee, t he lender must submit any required documents and certify to all \nconditions noted on Form RD 3555- 18/18E ( including any attachments to the form ).  \nChapter 16 of this Handbook provides additional guidance to obtain the Loan Note Guarantee.   \nB. Return of Incomplete  Application s \nIf the application  request  is missing information specified in  Attachment 15- A and/or \nthe final GUS Underwriting Findings Report , the Agency will suspend the application \nand request the missing documentation from the approved lender.  Once the file is complete,  the lender must alert OPD staff that all requested information is ready for a \nsubsequent review , as GUS does not automatically alert the Agency  when new \ndocumentation is uploaded. The file will then be placed in line again for Agency review.  \nIf the lender cannot provide the necessary information, the lender should request to \nwithdraw the loan file from GUS. Agency staff will not withdraw loan files without first \ncontacting the lender to request the missing documentation.  \nC. The Request for a Loan Guarantee is Denied  \nThe loan guarantee request will be denied if the proposed loan fails to meet program \nrequirement s.

Accepting the Conditions  \nIf the lender understands and agrees to accept the conditions listed on Form RD 3555-\n18/18E , no further communication with the Agency is required until the lender is ready to \nrequest the loan guarantee.  The loan must close in accordance with Form RD 3555-\n18/18E which includes:   \n1. A loan amount equal to or less than the authorized amount ,  \n2. An interest  rate equal to or less than the authorized amount, and  \n3. Compliance with  all stated conditions .    \nB. Declining the Conditions for Loan Guarantee  \nIf the lender determines that the terms and conditions stated on Form RD 3555-\n18/18E  cannot be met, that the loan guarantee is not needed, or that the loan will not go to \nclosing, the lender must inform the Agency in writing as soon as possible.  T he funds for \nthat loan  request  are reserved  for the transactio n until the expiration of the Conditional \nCommitment. Upon being informed that the lender intends to decline the conditions for \nloan guarantee, Agency staff will cancel the loan guarantee obligation in GLS .  This will \nrelease the committed funds for reallocation to a new commitment.  \nC. Requesting Changes in Conditions  \nRequests to close the loan at a lower loan amount or interest rate than those \nauthorized on the issued Conditional Commitment do not require any action.  If the \nlender believes that there are erroneous conditions and requirements on Form RD 3555-\n18/18E  that should be altered, the lender may  contact the Agency and propose \nalternative s.  The request must be via email  and must not affect the eligibility of the loan .   \nModifications t hat adversely affect the loan , such a s an increase  in loan amount, \ninterest rate, monthly liabilities, real estate taxes and homeowner\u2019 s insurance (that exceed \nthe allowed threshold) ; or lower repayment income , assets, etc. require a new \nunderwriting review.  Refer to the resubmission policy outlined in Chapter 5 of this Handbook. The lender is not authorized to close the loan until a new Form RD 3555-\n18/18E is issued.   ",

Advances for Property Repairs  \nServicer s must ensure that borrowers immediately notify them of any loss or damage \nto insured property and collect the amount of the loss from the insurance company.  \nBecause protective advances are covered by the guarantee, servicer s should advance \nfunds only to pay for emergency repairs to protect the security value of the property.  Protective advances for repairs should be considered only if the borrower informs the servicer  that an additional loan or reimbursement from an insurer cannot be obtained in \nan appropriate timeframe, or if the borrower has abandoned the property.  \nProtective advances that are not reimbursed through insurance coverage may be  \ncovered by the guarantee with proper documentation as to why the advance was not covered by insurance if  the advance was other than for taxes and insurance premiums.  \nEither the borrower or the servicer  may identify the need for repairs of the security \nproperty.  All repairs, replacements, and new construction must be planned, performed, and inspected in accordance with the standards specified in Chapter 12 of this Handbook.  \nIf the servicer  is unsure whether the repairs would affect the security value of the \nproperty, the servicer  should request that an inspector examine the property to assess \nwhether repairs are necessary.  Based on the value of the property, the servi cer must \ndetermine whether the repairs are cost effective and document this assessment in the servicer \u2019s file.

Advances for Taxes and Insurance \nThe servicer  is responsible for maintaining escrow funds in a reasonable and prudent \nmanner assuring real estate taxes, insurance, and assessments are paid timely even if a \nshortage exists requiring the servicer  to advance funds on behalf of the borrower .  The \nservicer  will notify the borrower in writing of any escrow shortages and document the \ndecision in the servicer \u2019s file.

If security property is \ninaccessible, the valuation will be based on exterior inspection only.  If a \nsignificant (20 % or more) decline from the value established at loan origination \nand the pre -foreclosure valuation is evident, the servicer is encouraged to review \nthe value determination in accordance with established quality controls and be \nprepared to support the decline  in value.  \n\u2022 Recovery Potential  \u2013 consider  the borrower\u2019s other assets, ability to pay the \ndeficiency, and other sources of recovery such as insurance claims or pending litigation.  \n\u2022 Foreclosure Bid  \u2013 the s ervicer should consider state statutory requirements and \nthe relationship of the outstanding debt and potential REO costs to the market value of the property.

Servicers must  respond to a request \nfor documentation from an attorney or trustee within five business days .  \nA. Acceptable Foreclosure Time Frames \nForeclosure must be initiated within 90 days of the date the decision to liquidate is \nmade unless the foreclosure  has been delayed by law or an alternative to foreclosure is \nrecommended to resolve the delinquency.  Initiation of fo reclosure begins with the first \npublic action required by law, such as filing a Complaint or Petition, recording a Notice \nof Default, or publication of a Notice of Sale.  The Acceptable State Foreclosure Time \nFrames lists the acceptable timeframe to complete a foreclosure by state and can be \nlocated on the USDA Training and Resource Library in the Loan Servicing section under Loss Mitigation found at https://www.rd.usda.gov/resources/usda -linc-training -resource -\nlibrary/loan -servicing .   These time frames are measured from the first legal action to the \nforeclosure sale date.  The Agency foreclosure time frames start with the date of the first legal action required by law, ends with the foreclosure sale date, and does not include post-sale redemption periods or sale confirmations.   \n\u2022 Redemption Period\n \u2013 since redemption periods may be adjusted under state laws \nbased on the circumstances surrounding a property, such as the amount of unpaid principal still owed or the occupancy status of the property, reasonable time frames for redemption periods and sale confirmations should be established on a case- by case basis in accordance with state law.  Reimbursement of accrued \ninterest may be reduced in accordance with Chapter 19 of this Handbook for each day that the foreclosure continues past t he prescribed time frame unless the \nservicer presents a valid reason that justifies the delay.  \n\u2022 Processing Delays\n \u2013 servicers must document any delays to the foreclosure \ntimeline when submitting the loss claim package.   Acceptable delays can include \nbankruptcy petitions filed after foreclosure initiation, contested foreclosures, and court scheduling delays or delays in obtaining service.  \n\u2022 Chapter 7 Bankruptcy\n \u2013 Servicers may be authorized a 90 -day extension to the \nallowable time frame for compliance with state law when a Chapter 7 bankruptcy delays the completion of foreclosure.  To determine the impact of a bankruptcy filing on the foreclosure time frame, the total number of days from first action to foreclosure sale will be calculated.  The total number of days between the bankruptcy filing date and the date of bankruptcy release or dismissal for each applicable bankruptcy case will then be subtracted from the total number of foreclosure days.  The resulting number of days will be compared to the Agency foreclosure time frame plus an automatic 90 -day extension to determine if the \ntime frame was met.  \n\u2022 Chapter 13 Bankruptcy\n \u2013 Additional time allowed for a Chapter 13 bankruptcy \ndelay shall not exceed 90 days from the date the payments under the bankruptcy ",

Any delay beyond 90 days from the date the account became 60 days delinquent under the terms of the bankruptcy plan must be supported by documentation. \n\u2022 Prompt Referral\n \u2013 Servicers must exercise reasonable due diligence requirements \nby resolving a dismissal of the bankruptcy, termination of the automatic stay, or trustee abandonment of all interest in the secured property.  The servicer\u2019s loss  \nclaim documentation must  demonstrate the case was promptly referred to the  \nforeclosure attorney after bankruptcy  filing .

Failure to \nsubmit the documentation supporti ng the extended foreclosure timeframe  as \ndescribed in Chapter 19 of this Handbook will result in denial of additional accrued interest.  \nB. Acceptable Liquidation Fees and Costs  \nAgency regulations authorize the reimbursement of actual liquidation fees and costs \nthat are paid by the servicer  for liquidated loans that result in a loss to the servicer  within \nthe limits of the guarantee.  The Acceptable State Liquidation Costs and Fees will be utilized in determining  allowable reasonable and customary  attorney  fees for foreclosure, \ndeed -in-lieu of foreclosure and bankruptcy. These costs and fees can be located on the \nUSDA Training and Resource Library in the Loan Servicing section under Loss Mitigation found at https://www.rd.usda.gov/resources/usda -linc-training -resource-\nlibrary/loan -servicing .  Fees higher  than the published amounts may be appropriate , in \ncases such as contested foreclosures, required probate procedures, etc.  Any \nreimbursement  of fees over the allowable costs are subject to review by the Agency on a \ncase- by-case basis.  Justification for higher fees must be documented in the file.   \nIt is important to make the distinction between attorney/trustee fees and \nattorney/trustee costs.  Typically, the fee for the service performed by the attorney is listed separately on the attorney invoice from the actual costs involved in the liquidation proceedings.  A complete list of allowable liquidation costs would not be practical since procedural requirements vary by jurisdiction.  Generally, the Agency will reimburse a \nservicer  for costs, which must be paid to public officials such as sheriffs, cler ks of court \nor recorders of deeds, as well as costs, which are required by law (i.e., private service of process and required publications).   \nIn-house expenses of the servicer  will not be allowed during the liquidation process.  \nEmployee salaries, staff attorneys and overhead charges are considered examples of in -\nhouse expenses.  Overhead expenses include, but are not limited to, items such as telephone calls, photocopying char ges, overnight mail fees and postage (not including \ncertified or registered mailings required by law).  Typical overhead costs are inherent to the foreclosure process and payment of these expenses is not reimbursable.   ",

Interrupted Foreclosure Proceedings:  \n      If a foreclosure proceeding is interrupted due to a bankruptcy filed by the borrower, or if a deed -in-lieu of foreclosure or pre -foreclosure sale is accepted prior to the \ncompletion of the foreclosure : \n \n\u2022 75% of the allowable attorney fee and all actual foreclosure costs incurred will  \n      be reimbursed . \n \n\u2022 In addition, 100% of allowable foreclosure attorney fees and costs incurred after \nthe bankruptcy stay is lifted will be reimbursed  if state statute requires that the \nforeclosure be restarted from the beginning.  \n \u2022 If state statute does not require that the foreclosure be restarted from the  \n      beginning, reimbursement of all foreclosure attorney fees incurred both before   \n      and after the bankruptcy is limited to the amount listed on the Acceptable State \nLiquidation Costs and Fees  and can be located on the USDA Training and \nResource Library in the Loan Servicing section under Loss Mitigation found at \nhttps://www.rd.usda.gov/resources/usda -linc-training -resource -library/loan -\nservicing .   \n The Agency will not reimburse any attorney fees or costs incurred for a prior \nliquidation action that has been reinstated by the borrower or for which the foreclosed property is redeemed.

During the suspension servicers should consider the following factors to  determine the appropriate course of \naction : \n\u2022 Evaluate the effects of the disaster .   \n\u2022 Instruct the borrower to file insurance claims and apply for disaster assistance that \nmay be available through FEMA, state , and local governments.",

The goal should be a \nformal relief provision that will cure the delinquency as soon as possible without imposing an undue hardship on the borrowe r.  Forbearance is highly encouraged in \ndisasters.  Under forbearance, the servicer can agree to reduce or suspend the borrower\u2019s monthly payments for up to 12 months .  At the conclusion of the forbearance  the \nborrower must agree to resume his or her regular monthly payments and to pay additional money at scheduled intervals toward repayment of the amount reduced or suspended.    \nRegular follow -up during a suspension and reassessment of the individual borrower\u2019s \ncircumstances, based upon property inspections, and borrower financial information  at \nthe end of the suspension period should be conducted.  If the servicer is not actively engaged in workout options with the borrower(s) and believes suspension beyond the 90-day period is warranted, the servicer must  document the reason to extend a hold on all \nforeclosure actions and retain the documentation in their collection systems.  Failure to do so may impact any future loss claim payment.  \nServicers may use existing loss mitigation workout options to reinstate a borrower \nready to resume mortgage responsibilities.  Late charges while the borrower is on a forbearance plan , or paying as agreed on a repayment plan , should not be assessed.

Special Relief Alternatives :  \nBorrowers must meet all the following eligibility criteria:  \n \n\u2022 The borrower occupies, as their primary residence, the property securing the guaranteed loan.   \n\u2022 The loan was  current o r less than thirty (30) days past due as of the date the  \napplicable PDD was declared . \n \n\u2022 The servicer receives verification  from the borrower the hardship \n(employment and/or property) has  been resolved .  \n ",

USDA does not allow  \nany type of balloon payment as part of the guaranteed UPB.

This involves working closely with the insurance carrier, the borrower, and repair  contractors.  The \nservicer  will complete a thorough analysis concerning the decision to repair the security \nproperty and document the decision.  The decision should support the best level of return to the servicer  and minimize loss to the Agency.   \nInsurance proceeds will be issued jointly to the servicer  and the borrower.  If the \ndecision is to use the proceeds to repair the property, the servicer  must ensure a licensed \ncontractor is used to complete the repairs.  Unless the homeowner qualifies for direct payment of insurance proceeds in accordance with of Chapter  17 of this Handbook, the \nservicer  will release the proceeds in draws based on periodic inspections.  The final draw \nwill be paid after verification that all repairs were satisfactorily completed.   The servicer  \nis responsible for obtaining all lie n waivers for work performed.    \nIf the premises have been destroyed, the servicer should compare the unpaid principal \nbalance with the insurance proceeds and any other circumstances affecting the case, such as local laws barring reconstruction of the destroyed property.

SERVICING EARLY DELINQUENCY LOANS (LESS THAN 90 DAYS  PAST      \nDUE)  \n \nThe purpose of all collection efforts is to bring a delinquent mortgage current in the \nshortest time  possible.  Single Family Housing Guaranteed Loan Program (SFHGLP) policy \nas stated in 7 CFR \u00a7  3555 describes minimum servicing requirements to accomplish this \nobjective.  The majority of one or two payment delinquencies will be addressed by either \nvoluntary reinstatement by borrowers, or through traditional collection methods outlined in 7 CFR \u00a7  3555 .  \nWhile a loss mitigation program is designed to address serious defaults, any reasonable \nservicer efforts to cure loans that are past due for 30 days or more contribute to the goal of helping residents in rural areas retain homeownership and reduce the Agency\u2019s losses.  Thus, effective loss mitigation b egins in the early stages of servicing defaulted loans . It is the \nservicer\u2019s responsibility to validate and document the borrower\u2019s capacity under the terms of the loss mitigation workout recommendation.  \n \nA. EARLY INTERVENTION \nTo facilitate a successful loss mitigation intervention, the servicer must attempt to \nmake verbal or written contact with the borrower  or an authorized representative if the \npayment is not received by the 20\nth day after it is due.  \nBefore an account becomes 60 days past due and if there is no contact or payment \narrangement in place, the servicer must send a certified letter to the borrower requesting \nan interview in an effort to resolve the past due account.  \nThe earlier the servicer contacts  the delinquent borrower and identifies the cause of \nthe default, the more likely it is that the default will be cured, and the borrower will be \nable to keep the home.  It is critical that the servicer make all decisions in a manner consistent with fair housing and lending principles. Servicers are strongly encouraged to recommend borrowers contact state and/or local agencies for financial assistance.   \nB.  CAUSE OF DEFAULT The servicer should identify the underlying cause of the delinquency at the earliest \nstage of borrower contact and determine if the problem is permanent or temporary.  A \nborrower whose ability to support the mortgage debt has been permanently reduced through death, divorce, or permanent disability is unlikely to cure the default through a repayment plan.  Such a borrower should be evaluated for either a loan modification, which may result in a reduction of the mortgage payment, or a pre -foreclosure sale, \nwhich allows a transition to more affordable housing.

DEFAULT COUNSELING  \nA borrower who receives early counseling is much more likely to bring the loan \ncurrent.  Servicers are strongly encouraged to recommend financial counseling to \nborrowers and establish working relationships with counseling agencies.  The servicer should provide  HUD\u2019s publication 2008- 5-FHA, Save your Home: Tips to Avoid \nForeclosure , rev April 2012 to the borrower , before the  account becomes 60 days past \ndue. This may not be feasible, however, if the borrower has filed a bankruptcy petition and, in the opinion of the servicer\u2019s legal counsel, providing a copy of the pamphlet would be a violation of the bankruptcy stay.  In such cases, the ser vicer should keep \ndocumentation of this fact in the servicing file.  \nD. INFORMAL REPAYMENT PLANS  \n     An informal repayment plan is a verbal agreement lasting for 3 months or less.  Such a \nplan is the first and best means to ensure that a one - or two -month delinquency does not \nescalate beyond the borrower\u2019s ability to cure.  In such a plan, the servicer should carefully review the borrower\u2019s financial situation and arrange payment terms that the borrower can realistically keep, and the delinquency can be cured.  Informal repayment \nplans should be documented and retained in the servicing permanent file .  If it becomes \napparent th at an informal repayment plan will not be sufficient to resolve the \ndelinquency, the servicer should refer to section 3, \u201cGeneral\u201d of this guide, to evaluate whether one of the more formal loss mitigation strategies should occur.  \nE. SALE OF THE PROPERTY  \nA borrower who does not have the ability to cure the delinquent loan, but who has \nsufficient equity  in the property  to satisfy the outstanding debt  from a  sale proceeds, \nshould be assisted in selling the property. This assistance may include a written agreement that provides a short -term reduction or suspension of payments pending the \nsale of the property .  The servicer has full responsibility in assisting the borrower in such \na case.  \n2. LOSS MITIGATION OVERVIEW  \nSFHGLP servicers have the authority and the responsibility to use effective actions and \nstrategies to assist borrowers to retain their homes, and thus reduce losses to the Agency and the servicer.  Because of its ongoing relationship with the borrower, the servicer is in the best position to determine which, if any, loss mitigation strategies are appropriate in each  \ncircumstance.   ",

(Ensuring that the borrower receives the HUD publication https://www.hud.gov/sites/dfiles/Housing/documents/RevUpdHmownSuc121518f\nnl.pdf  titled Homeowners Guide to Success, is acceptable, as well as \ndocumentation in the servicing and collection notes of conversations with the borrower  concerning mitigation options) . \n\u2022 Evaluate each delinquent loan once they become greater than 30 days past due but no later than the 90th day of delinquency to determine which loss mitigation option is appropriate . \n\u2022 Use loss mitigation wheneve r feasible to avoid foreclosure.  \n\u2022 Reevaluate each delinquent loan monthly until delinquency is cured or the  \nforeclosure action is complete . \n\u2022 Report loss mitigation actions through monthly default status reporting using ESR  \nstatus of mortgage code values\n. \n\u2022 Initiate foreclosure within six months (180 days) of default unless a loss \nmitigation option is being pursued and ensure that all actions taken are \ndocumented . \n\u2022 Initiate foreclosure timely on vacant and abandoned properties . \n\u2022 Retain a complete audit trail showing all loss mitigation actions .  \n3.

If perpetrated by a servicer, such actions may lead to administrative and/or judicial penalties against the servicer.  \nB. OWNER OCCUPANCY \n  The borrower must occupy the property as their principal residence to be eligible for \nloss mitigation retention options. However, l oss mitigation  disposition options may be \nconsidered if the property has been recently vacated due to one of the following, but not \nlimited to , special circumstances:  \n \n\u2022 Employment transfer  \n\u2022 Natural disaster   \n\u2022 Medical condition  \nA servicer may make an exception for a non- occupant borrower who is seeking relief \nthrough a pre -foreclosure sale (PFS) or DIL when the reason for vacancy was involuntary \nin nature.   The servicer maintains the documents justifying such an exception in the \nservicing file.   \nC. OTHER ELIGIBILITY FACTORS  \nThe following eligibility restrictions apply in all cases:  \n \n\u2022 A borrower who has a pending/active bankruptcy may be considered for loss \nmitigation options; however, the servicer must fully document the borrowers pending plan with items such as , but not limited to, a copy of the \nproposed/confirmed trustee plan.  T he servicer must obtain trustee approval prior \nto loss mitigation plan execution . \n\u2022 If a servicing agreement, investor guidelines , or applicable law restricts or \nprohibits compliance with any steps outlined in this guide, the servicer must maintain evidence in the loan file documenting the nature of any deviation from the provided guidance . \nD. 90 DAY REVIEW  \nThe servicer evaluates each  delinquent SFHGLP loan that it services when monthly \ninstallments are due and unpaid for 91 days, and considers all loss mitigation techniques ",
  "page_355": "HB-1-3555 \nAttachment 18 -A \nPage 6 of 30 \n   \n to determine which, if any, are appropriate.  To meet this evaluation requirement, the \nservicer\u2019s early involvement in the delinquency is demonstrated by contact with the borrower to gather sufficient information about the borrower\u2019s circumstances, intentions, and financial condition.  While the servicer cannot be responsible if a borrower fails to respond to repeated contacts, the servicer must clearly document aggressive efforts to reach the borrower within 90 days of the default.  \nE. CURABLE DEFAULT  \nWhen the hardship no longer exists  and the borrower is committed to remaining in \nthe home, the servicer should consider reinstatement options in this order:  \n\u2022 Special forbearance  \n\u2022 Loan modification  \n \nF. NON- CURABLE DEFAULT  \nWhen the hardships continue to exist , the delinquency is not curable , and the \nborrower is not committed to remaining in the home, the servicer should consider disposition options in this order:  \n\u2022 Pre-foreclosure sale (PFS)  \n\u2022 Deed -in-lieu of foreclosure  (DIL)  \nG. OPTION PRIORITY  \nThe following waterfall of loss mitigation workout options must be adhered to:  \n1.  Informal Repayment Plan  \n                  2.  Special Forbearance  \n3.  Loan Modification  \n4.  Pre -Foreclosure Sale  \n5.  Deed -In-Lieu \nWhenever possible, the servicer should review the borrower for all loss mitigation \noptions concurrently and if eligible, provide a decision based on the highest available option in the waterfall.  In all cases, if a borrower is eligible for both a retention and a pre-foreclosure option, the retention option must be prioritized.  If the borrower accept s \nand then fails a retention option within the first 12  months, they can be offered a pre -\nforeclosure option based on this evaluation with no further need to document ability/ inability to pay.

MONTHLY EVALUATION  \nEach month the account remains delinquent, the servicer must reev aluate  the status of \neach loan following the 90 -day review and maintains documentation of the evaluations in \nits servicing or collection system.  The evaluation may be as simple as notes in the \ncollection system that the borrower\u2019s payments under special forbearance are made as agreed.  Reports generated by servicing systems that track repayment plans are adequate for documentation purposes.  \nI. EVALUATING THE BORROWERS FINANCIAL CONDITION  \nFor any loss mitigation option, the servicer must obtain detailed financial information \nfrom the borrower.  The servicer may ask the borrower to give this information on a form of its choice that collects  all the data elements required for loss mitigation.  \nIf the borrower is cooperative, the information may be taken during a telephone \ninterview if it is a complete picture of the borrower\u2019s financial information.  Regardless of how the financial information is initially obtained , the servicer should request the \nborrower provide evidence to support the income with current paystubs and/or a profit and loss statement if the borrower is self -employed.  T he servicer should obtain a credit \nreport to verify debts, and any other forms of verification the servicer deems appropriate.  \n Once a servicer has the borrower\u2019s complete financial information, they  should \nanalyze the borrower\u2019s current and future ability to meet the monthly mortgage obligation by determining  the borrower\u2019s repayment ability  as follo ws: \n\u2022 Determine the borrower\u2019s current monthly gross  income making necessary \nadjustments for income fluctuations.  \n\u2022 Calculate  the borrower\u2019s normal monthly financial obligations including debt \nservice on the mortgage and other credit obligations.  Adjust  for obligations due \nover the term of the proposed special forbearance agreement, or in the case of all other options, for a minimum of three months.  \n\u2022 Any child support or a limony obligations should be documented with a court \norder to determine the monthly obligation.  \n\u2022 Determine the borrowers current Housing to Income (HTI) ratio as well as t heir \ntotal deb t (TD) ratio . \nAll detailed financial information used to determine the borrower\u2019s financial capacity \nmust be dated within 90 days from the date of receipt by the servicer. The servicer must \ncommunicate a decision to the borrower within 30 days of receiving a complete loss \nmitigation package.   ",

A borrower with sufficient \nincome should be asked to cure the debt through a retention option.  \nJ. INCOME VERIFICATION \nServicers shall document their process in determining each borrower\u2019s income \nscenario.  When verifying income of a borrower , servicers should use good business \njudgment consistent with how they evaluate borrowers when modifying loans held in their own portfolio but at a minimum collect  the following:  \n \n\u2022 Wage or Salary income:  \no Paystub( s) not more than 90 days old at time of submission to servicer, that \ncovers at least 4 weeks of earned income.  \no Borrowers most recent W- 2 or executed tax returns  (can be waived if paystubs \ndocument at least 6 months YTD income) . \n\u2022 Self-Employment Income:  \no Most recent quarterly or YTD profit and loss statement along with a copy of the most recent executed t ax return.  Audited financial statements are not \nrequired.  \n\u2022 Other/ Benefit Income : \no Bonus, commission, tips, overtime, etc. income must be documented with reliable third -party  evidence that such income is consistent and likely to \ncontinue.   \no Benefit income including but not limited to social security, disability, public assistance, and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits \ncan be considered income for the purpose of loss mitigation.  Benefit income must be documented through award letter, exhibits, or benefits statements from the provider or evidence of receipt to the borrower.  \n\u2022 Non- Taxable Income : \no The servicer, at its discretion, may \u201cgross up\u201d income not subject to f ederal \ntaxes.  When grossing up any income , the servicer must document and support \nthe amount of grossed up income and should use the same effective tax rate , \nnot to exceed 25% , for grossing up that the borrower used to calculate the \nborrower\u2019s federal income  tax return  from the previous year. \no Excluding documentation from prior years, all financial information must be dated within 90 days from the date of receipt by the servicer.  \n ",

NON- BORROWER INCOME  \nIncome from a non -borrower who also occupies the property may be used to support \npayments under all loss mitigation options with the following restrictions:  \n\u2022 Servicers should consult their legal counsel to determine if non -borrower income \ncan be utilized for loss mitigation  home retention options  since the non -borrower \nis not on the original mortgage . \n\u2022 Occupancy of the non- borrower  must be fully verified . \n\u2022 Servicer should conduct a financial review  of the entire household income and \nobligations to determine if there is sufficient income to pay back the arrearages . \n\u2022  If the Servicer determines the  non- borrower household member is required by \nstate law to be included on the modified note, the non- borrower household \nmember must sign all required loss mitigation documentation.  \nL. DIVORCE / LEGAL SEPARATION \nIn instances where borrowers are divorced or legally separated , a lender can exclude \nan obligated borrower when determining eligibility for all loss mitigation options, \nproviding the court has deemed the excluded borrower not responsible for the mortgage.  The remaining obligated borrower must provide the fully executed legal document ( ex. \nDivorce Decree) that shows the court\u2019s order, as well as an executed Quit Claim if necessary.   If documented, the divorced/separated party does not need to sign any \nrequi red documentation for the purposes of loss mitigation.  Any borrower excluded from \neligibility requirements is still obligated to the note and is not released from liability.  \nM. INELIGIBLE BORROWER \nIf the borrower is not eligible for any loss mitigation alternative based on information \nsecured from the borrower in a telephone interview, the servicer should advise the borrower of the reason(s) and allow the borrower at least seven calendar days to submit additional information that might have an impact upon the servicer\u2019s evaluation.  The servicer will retain the financial analysis and supporting documentation and make it available for compliance reviews.  Collection actions may con tinue.  \nN. COMBINED OPTION \nLoss mitigation options may be used alone or in combination to resolve an existing \ndefault.  For example : \n\u2022 Pre-foreclosure sale may be combined with a deed -in-lieu provision in case the \nproperty does not sell within the time required.  \n\u2022 A servicer may utilize a trial plan with a loan modification when there is any doubt about a borrower\u2019s long- term income stability.

FORECLOSURE  \nThe servicer must consider all feasible loss mitigation options before initiating \nforeclosure.  The servicer must document all options considered and retain such \ninformation for Agency review.  If the borrower abandons  the property, loss mitigation \nhome retention options need not be considered prior to initiating the foreclosure.  \nP. TIME TO INITIATE ACTION  \nA servicer must initiate a loss mitigation option or refer to  foreclosure within six \nmonths of the date of default.  This requirement is considered satisfied by any of the following actions.   \n\u2022 The loan is brought current or paid off . \n\u2022 The borrower executes a special forbearance agreement . \n\u2022 The loan modification is approved.  \n\u2022 The borrower executes a pre- foreclosure sale or deed in lieu  agreement . \n\u2022 The servicer initiates the first legal action to begin foreclosure . \n \nQ. SERVICER REPORTING  \nThe servicer reports these actions in the month they occur , or if after the monthly cut -\noff date, in the next reporting cycle using the appropriate ESR  status code.   \nR. EXTENSION REQUESTS  \nIf the servicer initiate s a special forbearance or loan modification, but is unable to \ncomplete it, the servicer may approve an extension to the timeframe to initiate foreclosure \nprovided the loss mitigation option began prior to the timeframe that foreclosure was to be initiated.  To qualify for the extension, the servicer must document evidence that it \nanalyzed the borrower\u2019s complete financial situation and evaluated the appropriate loss mitigation options.  In addition, the servicer reports the loss mit igation initiative using the \nappropriate ESR status code in the monthly default status report.  \nThe servicer may approve an extension for completing a deed -in-lieu of foreclosure.  \nIf the servicer attempts a repayment plan  (not special forbearance), the servicer may \napprove an extension before the timeframe to initiate foreclosure expires and explains why an extension is necessary.

OPTION FAILURE  \nIf loss mitigation options fail, the servicer may either resume or initiate foreclosure  or \ninitiate another loss mitigation option.  Failure occurs under any of the f ollowing \ncircumstances:  \n\u2022 The borrower does not perform under the terms of a written special fo rbearance \nagreement for 60 days . \n\u2022 The borrower does not perform under the terms of a trial period used as a \ncondition of loan modification. Servicers must continue to perform outreach \nefforts to borrowers for other workout alternatives.  Borrowers\u2019 financial capacity \nwill dictate whether a retention or disposition workout alternative is feasible.  \n\u2022 There is no signed contract of sale within 3 months of a pre -foreclosure sale \nagreement; or if there is a signed contract of sale, settlement has not occurred within 6 months of the agreement; or the borrower notifies the servicer of withdrawal from the ag reement; or the servicer notifies the borrower in writing \nthat it has terminated the agreement for non- compliance . \nT. DOCUMENTATION \nFor each  loss claim, the servicer must maintain evidence in its servicing notes and \ncollection history systems of its compliance with loss mitigation guidelines as well as supporting documentation including all communications with the Agency.  The servicing \nnotes and collection history systems also must retain  evidence  of compliance with \ncounseling and other actions on loans that do not result in a  loss claim.  \nU. SERVICING PLAN  \nThe servicer  must add a servicing plan in the \u201cAdd Loss Mitigation\u201d  screen in  USDA  \nLINC when a method other than foreclosure is approved to resolve the  borrower\u2019s  \ndelinquency.  The servicing plan must be submitted prior to implementing any action with the borrower. For pre -foreclosure sales and deed -in-lieu of foreclosure alternatives, \nthe servicer must retain a  \u201cDisposition (PFS/DIL) Cost Benefit Analysis \u201d along with the \nservicing plan. \nIf the servicer provides the borrower with an option that requires a trial payment, the \nservicer must enter the trial modification into USDA LINC at the  time of approval.  \nWhen the borrower completes the trial period and executes the final agreement, the servicer must enter the final modification terms into USDA LINC and finalize the modification.  If the borrower fails to perform under the trial agreement, the servicer must \ncancel the trial modification in USDA LINC.  \n4. SPECIAL FORBEARANCE  \nA special forbearance agreement is a written plan that may temporarily reduce or suspend \npayments and/or gradually increase monthly payments in an amount sufficient to repay the ",
  "page_361": "HB-1-3555 \nAttachment 18 -A \nPage 12 of 30 \n   \n arrearage for a short period.  A special forbearance agreement may also involve payments for \nseveral months followed by a loan modification. The agreement provides the borrower with relief not typically afforded under an informal repayment agreement.  Examples of provisions in a special forbearance agreement include a repayment term of four or more months;  suspending or reducing payments for one or more months to allow the borrower to \nrecover from the cause of default; or an agreement to allow the borrower to resume making full monthly payments while delaying repayment of the arrearage.  \nA special forbearance is a plan that involves one of the following:  \n\u2022 Full repayment:  Monthly payments in an amount sufficient to repay the arrearage over time, typically less than or equal to six months ; or  \n\u2022 Hardship or disaster forbearance:  Reduced or suspended monthly payments while the borrower(s) resolves the hardship, such as unemployment, followed by an evaluation for other home preservation options if needed.  \nThe maximum arrearage under a special forbearance plan can not exceed the equivalent of \n12 months delinquency.   \nA. LOAN ELIGIBILITY  \nThe loan is a minimum of 30 days delinquent , or at risk of imminent default, but not \nmore than 12 payments delinquent and is not in foreclosure when a special forbearance \nagreement is executed.    The servicer may suspend foreclosure, on advice of its legal counsel, subject to the borrower\u2019s performance under the terms of the special forbearance \nagreement, if the suspension is stated in writing in the agreement.  \nB. PROPERTY ELIGIBILITY  \nThe servicer must conduct an inspection to verify that the property has no physical \nconditions that adversely affect either the borrower\u2019s continued use or ability to support the debt. Normally a simple curbside inspection is sufficient; however, a borrowe r will \nnot be able to support payments under a special forbearance plan if the property is in such a deteriorated condition that repairs will ex haust  the borrower\u2019s monthly resources.  The \nservicer must use good business judgement to determine if an interior inspection should \nbe utilized.  The analysis of the borrower\u2019s  income should consider obvious property \nmaintenance expenses.  \nThe use of good business judgment is imperative.  If significant deferred maintenance \nis a contributing cause of the default, it may be appropriate to provide a period of mortgage forbearance during which specified repairs are completed at the borrower\u2019s expense.  If the property is in extremely poor physical condition, a special forbearance \nplan that allows a reduction or suspension of payments must cont ain a requirement to \nrepair the property.  ",

BORROWER ELIGIBILITY  \nSpecial forbearance may be offered to a borrower who has recently experienced a \nverified loss of income or an increase in living expenses.  The  borrower should be the \nowner -occupant of the property securing the SFHGLP loan and committed to occupying \nthe property as a primary residence .  \nD. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS  \nThe servicer\u2019s responsibility is to validate and document the borrower\u2019s capacity \nunder the terms of the recommendation.  The servicer determines that the borrower has \nthe capacity to support the modified monthly payments and bring the loan current under \nthe terms of a forbearance plan.  The proposed repayment terms must be consistent with the borrower\u2019s ability to pay.  The following documentation must be obtained to determine financial capacity of the borrower:     \n\u2022 Letter from borrower outlining  their involuntary inability to pay/hardship  \n\u2022 Income Documentation as stated in the overview section  \n\u2022 Credit Report  \n\u2022 Detailed budget  \n\u2022 Documentation of any other sources of income to be used in evaluation  \n \nExcluding documentation from prior years, all financial information must be dated \nwithin 90 days from the date of receipt by the servicer.  If the servicer\u2019s  financial analysis \ndetermines that the borrower either does not, or will not, have the ability to resume full monthly payments in the near future, special forbearance should not be used.  The servicer should then consider other loss mitigation options.  \nE. UNEMPLOYMENT  \nWhen it has been determined  that the reason for default is unemployment and the \nborrower does not have any immediate opportunities for re -employment, SFHGLP \nextends additional latitude to servicers to mitigate losses.  \nServicers have the authority to enter into a forbearance agreement with a borrower \nwho is unemployed or significantly underemployed and seeking re -employment at the \ntime the borrower\u2019s financials are being analyzed by the servicer.   The term of this \nforbearance shall be the lessor of 12 months or a term that would not cause the dollar amount of the borrower\u2019s delinquency to exceed 12 months of scheduled monthly mortgage payment reduction and, will be contingent upon the servicer\u2019s financial analysis of the borrower .  As a condition of the forbearance agreement, the borrower must pursue \nemployment during the term of the forbearance agreement. Additionally, the borrower must contact the servicer if their employment status changes.  ",
  "page_363": "HB-1-3555 \nAttachment 18 -A \nPage 14 of 30 \n   \n The servicer is required to verify the borrower\u2019s employment status monthly and \nrestructure the forbearance agreement or evaluate the borrower for another option, such \nas a loan modification, when the borrower\u2019s employment status changes.  As with \nSFHGLP\u2019s standard forbearance agreement, all of the requirements apply to these s pecial \nprovisions.  \nF. DOCUMENTATION \nThe servicer should provide the borrower a written agreement to be signed and \nreturned with the first payment,  that clearly defines the term, frequency of payments, and \namounts due under the special forbearance plan.  The agreement acknowledges \npreviously missed mortgage payments and states that failure to comply with its terms can \nresult in foreclosure. In the absence of a signed agreement, the servicer may accept the borrower\u2019s  modified payment as acknowledgment of the terms of the forbearance.  If the \nborrower fails to provide the servicer with the signed agreement prior to the end of the forbearance, the servicer should document their continued efforts to collect the agreement.  There is no maximum length for a special forbearance agreement and the servi cer may allow as much time as is reasonable based on the borrower\u2019s repayment \nability.  \nAn acceptable agreement should:  \n\u2022 Provide the borrower with relief not available under an informal payment plan.  \n\u2022 Not at any time allow the total arrearage amount t o exceed the equivalent of 12   \nmonths delinquency. \n\u2022 Not allow late fees to be charged while the borrower is performing under the \nterms of a special forbearance agreement . \n\u2022 Permit allowable foreclosure costs and late fees accrued before the special \nforbearance agreement is executed to be included as part of the repayment schedule.  However, such costs and late fees are collected only after payment of all principal, interest, and escrow advances.  The loan is never considered \ndelinquent only because the borrower has not paid late fees or other foreclosure costs.   \nG.  REVIEW AND RENEGOTIATION \nThe servicer reviews the status of a special forbearance plan each month and takes \nappropriate action if the borrower is not complying with the terms of the plan.  A plan may be renegotiated if the borrower\u2019s financial circumstances change; however, under a \nrenegotiated plan, the loan cannot accrue more than 12 months delinque ncy. \n5. LOAN MODIFICATION \nA loan modification is a permanent change in one or more of the terms of a loan that \nresults in a payment the borrower can afford and allows the loan to be brought current.

Loan modifications \nmay include capitalization of the arrearage.  Capitalization may also include foreclosure fees \nand costs that are associated with the current foreclosure action, deficits in tax and insurance accounts, past due annual fees imposed by the servicer, but not late charges or servicers fees.  \nA modification may be appropriate for a borrower who has experienced a permanent or \nlong- term reduction in income or an increase in expenses, or who has recovered from the \ncause of the default but does not have sufficient income to repay the arrearage thro ugh a \nrepayment plan.  To qualify for a modification, the borrower has a documented ability to support the monthly mortgage debt after the terms of the loan are modified.  \nA. LOAN ELIGIBILITY  \nTo modify the loan under loss mitigation:  \n\u2022 The loan must be in default or at risk of imminent  default .  \n\u2022 The loan is not in foreclosure at the time the modification is executed; however, a \nloan removed from foreclosure status may be modified.  \n\u2022 The default is due to a verified loss of income or increase in expenses.  \n \nB. PROPERTY ELIGIBILITY  \nWhile the modification option does not have a loan- to-value restriction, and an \nappraisal is not required, the servicer must conduct an inspection to verify that the property has no physical conditions that adversely impact the borrower\u2019s continued use or ability to support the debt.  Normally a simple curbside inspection is sufficient; however, a borrower will not be able to support payments under a loan modification  plan if the \nproperty is in such a deteriorated condition that repairs will exhaust  the bor rower\u2019s \nmonthly resources.  The servicer must use good business judgement to determine if an interior inspection should be utilized , and if necessary, analysis of the borrower\u2019s \nfinances  should consider anticipated property maintenance expenses.  If the property is in \nextremely poor physical condition, a modification may not offer a resolution of the default.  Costs to complete needed repairs may not be capitalized as part of a modification agree ment, and the borrower may not receive any cash from the \nmodif ication.  \nC.   BORROWER ELIGIBILITY  \nThe current borrower(s) on the existing Rural Development (RD) guaranteed single -\nfamily mortgage must be identical to the borrower(s) on the modified mortgage.  \nThe borrower(s) must be facing imminent default or be in default.   \nThe Servicer should not require the borrower to contribute cash to pay down ",

A modification must not be used to bring a loan current \nbefore a sale or assumption.  \nD. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS  \nTo be considered for a loan modification, the borrower must provide detailed \nfinancial information to the Servicer.   \nServicers may collect financial information from the borrower either in writing or \nduring a telephone interview.  Regardless of how the borrower\u2019s financial information \nwas secured, the Servicer must independently verify the financial information. \nThe following documentation must be obtained to determine financial capacity of the \nborrower:  \n\u2022 Documentation from borrower outlining the ir involuntary inability to  \npay/hardship. \n\u2022 Income documentation as stated in the overview section.  \n\u2022 The borrower\u2019s c redit r eport . \n     The credit report should only be used to validate monthly installment debt, \nrevolving debt, and secondary mortgage debt.  A borrower\u2019s credit score obtained from any credit repository will not be considered in determining whether a borrower is eligible for loss mitigation. \nQuestions relating to documentation requirements should be directed to the \nServicing Office  via email to guarantee.svc@usda.gov. \n1. UNDERWRITING GROSS MONTHLY INCOME \nGross monthly income includes the following, with respect to the borrower and \nany co-  borrower(s): \n\u2022 The gross amount, before any payroll deductions, of wages and salaries, \novertime pay, commissions, fees, tips, bonuses, and other compensation for \npersonal services.  \n\u2022 For self -employed borrowers, the net income from operation of a farm, \nbusiness, or profession.  \n\u2022 Interest, dividends, and net income of any kind from real or personal property (for example, investment income and rental income) . \n\u2022 Benefit income, including the full amount of periodic payments received ",

UNDERWRITING BACK- END TOTAL DEBT  RATIO  \nThe Back -End ratio (total debt ratio) is the ratio of the borrower\u2019s total recurring \nmonthly debts (such as the borrower\u2019s monthly mortgage payment (PITI ), payments \non all installment debts, monthly payments on all junior liens, alimony, child support, car lease payments, aggregate negative net rental income from all investment properties owned, and monthly mortgage payments for second homes) to the borrow er\u2019s gross monthly income.  \nThe s ervicer must validate all monthly installment debt, revolving debt, and \nsecondary mortgage debt.  This can be accomplished by pulling a credit report for \neach borrower or a joint report for married co -borrowers.   The s ervicer must also \nconsider any information obtained from the borrower orally or in writing concerning monthly obligations not reported on the credit file and document such obligations accordingly.  \nE. FORECLOSURE  \n       I f the foreclosure process has already begun, the Servicer should not proceed with \nthe foreclosure action  until the borrower has been evaluated for all loss mitigation options \nand, if eligible, an offer to participate in the  modification  has been made.  \nF. MODIFICATION PURPOSE  \n The purpose of a loan modification should be to provide payment relief to the \nborrower in the form of a reduced payment.  When no other payment relief options are available, the Servicer may find it necessary to offer the borrower a modification for \nwhich the payment is increased .  In cases where an increased payment is necessary, the \nborrower must demonstrate affordability by making at least 3 tria l payments prior to \nexecution of the modification . \nG. LIEN PRIORITY  \nThe servicer must ensure the first -lien status of the modified mortgage in compliance \nwith any applicable state or Federal laws and regulations.  ",

ESCROWS  \nServicers are required to escrow for borrowers\u2019 real estate taxes and mortgage- related \ninsurance payments.  \nI. MODIFICATION OPTIONS  \nThe following apply to loan modifications:  \n\u2022 The modification results in a fixed -rate fully amortizing loan . \n\u2022 The modified interest rate may be increased over the original note but may not \nexceed the current market interest rate at the  time of approval . \n\u2022 The modification brings the loan current . \nThe servicer shall calculate the target payment as close as possible to 31% of the \nverified gross monthly income.  Loan Modification options shall be used in the following \norder to bring the borrowers mortgage payment (PITI ) to as close as possible to the target \npayment . \n1. Capitalize all delinquency.  Capitalization may include foreclosure fees and costs that are associated with a current foreclosure action, deficits in tax and insurance accounts and past due annual fees imposed by the servicer.  Past due homeowner\u2019s association dues should be capitaliz ed, if necessary, to protect the \nfirst lien position.  Servicer late charges and fees cannot be capitalized.  \n2. Modify interest rate to a level at or below the maximum allowable rate as defined by the Agency.  If the maximum allowable interest rate has not been established \nby the Agency, the servicer should use the most recent Freddie Mac Weekly Primary Mortgage Market Survey (PMMS) rate for 30- year fixed rate mortgages \nplus 50 basis points rounded to the nearest one \u2013eighth of one percent (0.125%) . \n3. If the target payment is unable to be achieved with rate modification  alone, the \nservicer shall extend the term in one -month increments, up to a maximum of 480 \nmonths  until one of the following is achieved.  \na. The mortgage payment is at or below the target and the payment has    been reduced a minimum of ten percent; or  \nb. The mortgage payment is at or below the target and the term has been    \nextended to the cap of 480 months.  \n4. Rate and/or Term extension thresholds outline above should be considered maximum allowable modifications. The servicer may establish lower rate and/or term allowable costs based on contractual restrictions.  \n5. If the targeted monthly mortgage payment still cannot be achieved, the servicer may consider a Mortgage Recovery Advance (MRA) as outlined below in S ection \n5(J), to reduce the borrowers interest bearing principal, in addition to the rate/term ",
  "page_368": "HB-1-3555 \nAttachment 18 -A \nPage 19 of 30 \n(03-09-16)  SPECIAL PN   \nRevised ( 04-14-25)  PN  637 modification to achieve the monthly target payment. \n6. If the servicer has exhausted all steps of the waterfall and the target payment is \nnot achieved, however, the borrower\u2019s payment (PITI) has been reduced by a minimum of ten percent, the servicer should offer the modification to the borrower(s).  \n7. If it is determined the borrower cannot be provided with a payment reduction and no other options are available  a modification can still be offered , including a \nlimited increase in payment,  if the following conditions are met:  \na. The borrowers post modified payment is no greater than 36% of their \nmonthly income . \nb. The borrowers post modified payment has increased no more than 10%.  \nc.  The modified principal balance may exceed the loan\u2019s original principal  \nbalance.  \nd. The modified principal balance may exceed 100% loan- to-value.  \ne. The use of a trial pa yment to support the borrower\u2019s  willingness and \nability to pay is encouraged for a modification, however , it is not required  \nunless an MRA is utilized as part of the modification .  If the servicer \nshould determine a trial payment is the best course of action , they should \nfollow the trial period guidance provided below .  \nJ. MORTGAGE RECOVERY ADVANCE  \nAll new MRAs will not be secured with a note/mortgage in favor of the Agency. \nPrior MRAs will be referred to as \u201cLegacy MRAs\u201d. The maximum amount of the MRA is 30% of the unpaid principal balance at the time of the initial default and shall \ninclude any principal reduction needed to achieve the target monthly mortgage \npayment. If the borrower has previously been provided an MRA of any type, they may be considered for an additional MRA providing that the combined amount of MRAs does not exceed the 30% maximum outlined above.  \n In order to set -up the MRA, the servicer should advance the funds to the \nborrower\u2019s account by creating a non -interest -bearing recoverable servicing advance as \na receivable on the borrower's behalf. This amount should be stated on the monthly mortgage stat ement along with the principal balance.  \n To file a claim for reimbursement of a MRA, the s ervicer must submit a claim to \nRD within 60 days of the advance being executed by the borrower through his or her signature on the MRA Agreement .  When filing the claim for reimbursement with RD, \nthe servicer must upload  a copy of the MRA Agreement signed by the borrower(s)  \nusing the USDA LINC website .  The s ervicer must also upload  a summary of the ",
  "page_369": "HB-1-3555 \nAttachment 18 -A \nPage 20 of 30 \n   \n amount of the funds advanced, including the monthly PITI A and principal curtailment \n(if applicable), and other account information indicating the borrower's arrearage \nbefore the advance.  In addition, the servicer should supply the present status of the account as of the date of the advance  including evidence the loan has been reinstated ; \nthe name, address, and tax ID number for the servicer; and the name, address, and \nphone number of a contact person for the s ervicer who can answer questions about the \nreimbursement request.  \n \nThe complete claim, including all supporting documents referred to above, must be \nsubmitted within 60 days of the execution of the mortgage recovery advance.   \nAll required documentation must be uploaded via USDA LINC  for reimbursement.  \n \n1. MRA GUIDELINES  \nNo interest will accrue on the MRA. The payment of the MRA  is not due \nuntil the earliest of (i) the maturity of the modified mortgage, (ii) the borrower transfers title to the property (by sale or by other voluntary or involuntary \nmeans), or (iii) a pay -off of the mortgage.   \n \nBorrowers are not required to make any monthly or periodic payments on \nthe MRA. However, borrower(s) may voluntarily submit partial payments without incurring any prepayment penalties. Any repayment by the borrower of the MRA, whether partial or incomplete , must be remitted back to the agency \nfrom the servicer prior to release of the lien.  \n If the servicer releases the lien without collecting the advance from the \nborrower, the servicer must reimburse the Agency from their own funds except in cases where the guarantee is terminated due to a loss event such as a Short Sale, Deed in Lieu, or For eclosure.  \nFor legacy MRAs, t he borrower must send payment directly to RD . The \napplicable payment mailing address information can be found on the Loan \nServicing page of the LINC Training and Resource Library, located at https://www.rd.usda.gov/resources/usda -linc-training -resource -library . \n \nK. STAND ALONE MRA  \nIf the servicer determines the borrower is able to make their current contractual \npayment , the servicer can offer the borrower a stand -alone MRA to cure the delinquency \nif the following criteria are met:  ",

The MRA is limited to an \namount no greater than what is necessary to resolve any delinquency and unreimbursed \nservicer advances made during the delinquency and must meet all other requirements as \nexplained in section 5.K above. \nL. TRIAL PAYMENT REQUIREMENTS  \nPrior to modifying a loan using any type of MRA or a modification in which the \nborrower\u2019s payment increases, the servicer must have the borrower complete a trial \nperiod during which the borrower makes the monthly mortgage payment they would \nmake under the modified mortgage.  \nFor borrowers who are in default when a trial payment is  initiated, the trial period \nmust be three months in length.  The servicer cannot modify the loan unless the \nborrower makes all three modified  trial payments in the month in which they are due . \nFor borrowers facing imminent default when a trial payment  is initiated, the trial \nperiod must be four months in length.  The s ervicer cannot modify the loan unless the \nborrower makes all four reduced trial payments in the month in which they are due . ",

SUBSEQUENT USE  \nIf a loan has been modified within the previous two years, re -default risk is presumed \nto increase following a subsequent modification.  Before granting a modification in this \ncircumstance, the servicer must validate the borrower has experienced a change i n \ncircumstances that led to a separate default or imminent default unrelated to the first.  Any such decision must be documented and placed in the servicing file.  A subsequent modification should be an unusual occurrence, and the cause of the second default should not be related to the original reason for default.    \nR. LOAN NOTE GUARANTEE  \nThe terms of the SFHGLP Loan Note Guarantee (LNG) may change.  The LNG may \nbe extended to coincide with the terms of a loan modification that meets the eligibility criteria as noted in 7 CFR \u00a7 3555.303.  Any loss on the modified loan is limited to the lessor of either 90 % of the original loan amount, or the sum of the first 35 % of the loss \nand 85%  of the balance of the loss.  \nS.

Additionally, the \nservicer must upload notification that if the modification was not executed by the \nborrower via USDA LINC.  \n  The agreement should contain the following key data elements:  \n\u2022 Borrower and co- borrower name(s) and ID number(s)  \n\u2022 Effective modification  date  \n\u2022 Modified unpaid principal balance  \n\u2022 Eligible interest and costs capitalized  \n\u2022 Sum of modified  principal and capitalized interest and costs  \n\u2022 Interest rate  \n\u2022 Maturity date  \nT. AGENCY ACTION  \nThe Agency staff processes the loan modification by means of the Guaranteed Loan \nSystem  (GLS) . \n6.   PRE- FORECLOSURE SALE /DEED- IN-LIEU  \nThe pre -foreclosure sale (PFS) option allows a borrower in default to sell his or her home \nand use the sale proceeds to satisfy the mortgage debt even if the proceeds are less than the ",
  "page_373": "HB-1-3555 \nAttachment 18 -A \nPage 24 of 30 \n   \n amount owed.  This option is appropriate for a borrower whose financial situation requires \nthe sale of the home, but who is unable to do so because the value of the property has declined to less than the amount owed on the mortgage.  \nA borrower wishing to use the PFS option submits a request to the servicer along with \nany financial information the servicer requires.  The servicer obtains a recent market value appraisal and preliminary title report to determine the feasibility of the PFS.  The servicer notifies the borrower whether the request is approved. \nThe borrower makes a commitment to actively market the property for a period of at least \nthree months, during which time the servicer delays foreclosure action.  If the property does not sell, the servicer  is encouraged to work with the borrower to determine  the eligibility  for \na deed -in-lieu of foreclosure.   \nDeed -in-lieu of foreclosure (DIL) is a disposition option in which a borrower voluntarily \ndeeds the collateral property to the servicer in exchange for a release from all obligations under the mortgage.  A  DIL is usually preferable to foreclosure because it avoids the time \nand expense of a legal foreclosure action , and the property is generally in better physical \ncondition at acquisition due to the cooperative nature of the transaction.  \nThe servicer may only review a borrower for a DIL prior to a PFS in cases of death, \nborrower incapacitation or other extreme circumstances.  The servicer must use good business judgement when making this determination and retain all appropriate documentati on \nin the servicing file.  \nA. LOAN ELIGIBILITY  \nThe loan is in default (delinquent more than 30 days) at the time the pre -foreclosure \nsale is closed.  A servicer may exercise discretion to accept an application from a \nborrower who is facing imminent default, and if the loan will be in default by the time the \npre-foreclosure sale is completed.  The servicer documents this decision in the servicing \nfile.  Under no circum stances shall PFS be available to borrowers who have voluntarily \nstopped paying their mortgage  despite their continued ability to pay.  \nB. BORROWER ELIGIBILITY  \nThe PFS option may be extended to a borrower who meets all of the following : \n\u2022 Is in default or facing imminent default due to a verified increase in living \nexpenses or decrease in income.  \n\u2022 Occupies the property as a primary residence (servicer must document occupancy \nstatus) . \n\u2022 Is not eligible for any available retention options . \n \nIn addition, borrowers who have failed to perform on an accepted loan modification \nusing USDA guidance may be evaluated for a PFS option.

BORROWERS APPLICATION/DOCUMENTATION \nA defaulted borrower or a borrower facing imminent default who expresses interest in \na pre -foreclosure sale should be sent a copy of the servicer\u2019s PFS criteria.  Additionally, \nthe servicer is encouraged to proactively solicit participation by a borrower who is in default or facing imminent default on an SFHGLP first mortgage and who is unable to cure the default.  \nBy signing and returning the application with the required financial information, the \nborrower should acknowledge receipt of housing counseling, and agree to:      \n\u2022 List the property with a licensed real estate b roker unrelated to the borrower  (The \nlisting agreement should include a specific cancellation clause in the event the terms of a sale are not acceptable) . \n\u2022 Make a good faith effort to aggressively market the property.  \n\u2022 Perform all normal property maintenance and repairs until closing of the pre -\nforeclosure sale.  \nD. PROPERTY VALUE  \nThe servicer obtains a standard market value appraisal from an appraiser who does \nnot share any interest with the borrower or borrower\u2019s agent.  The appraisal contains both \u201cAs Is\u201d and \u201cAs Repaired\u201d values for the property and should be valid for six months.  A copy of the appraisal is shared with the homeowner or sales agent, if requested.  Appraisals or opinions of value provided by the borrower, or borrower\u2019s real estate agent are not acceptable.  The servicer reviews the appraisal and satisfies itself that the opinion represents the fair market value of the subject property.  The list price of \nthe property must reflect its fair market value.  The cost of the appraisal is reimbursable in the loss claim.  \nE. PROPERTY CONDITION \nProperties that have sustained serious damage (from fire, flood, earthquake, tornado, \netc.) should not be considered for PFS if the cost of repair exceeds ten  percent of the \u201cAs \nRepaired \u201d appraised value  until all insurance claims have been resolved .  The servicer \nmay exercise discretion to accept or reject a damaged property when the repair costs are less than the ten  percent threshold and should document the decision in the servicing file.  \nPrior to servicing plan submission , servicers must ensure that hazard insurance claims \ninvolving property damage are filed and settled expeditiously.  All repairs and replacements using the insurance proceeds must be planned, performed , and  inspected in \naccordance with Agency construction requirements and procedures. (7 CFR 3555.252)  ",
  "page_375": "HB-1-3555 \nAttachment 18 -A \nPage 26 of 30 \n   \n F. CONDITION OF TITLE  \nThe property has marketable title.  The servicer obtains a title search or preliminary \ntitle report to verify that the title is not impaired either with unresolvable title problems or \nwith junior liens that cannot be discharged.  If the servicer determines  that junior liens \nand other title issues can  be resolved, the borrower\u2019s PFS application may be approved, \nand resolution of the title issues can be pursued concurrent with the marketing effort. When reviewing for a DIL , all junior liens or issues with title must be resolved PRIOR to \napproval.  \nG. FINANCIAL / PROPERTY ANALYSIS  \nThe servicer determines the borrower\u2019s present and anticipated financial condition.  \nThe servicer projects the borrower\u2019s monthly income and uses good business \njudgment to determine that the borrower is unable to support the mortgage debt.  The servicer may continue with Pre -Foreclosure options , even if the debt is affordable , \nprovided the reason for default requires the borrower to relocate.    \nThe following documentation must be obtained and/or completed in order to \ndetermine financial capacity of the borrower:  \n\u2022    Letter from borrower outlining  their involuntary inability to pay/hardship. \n\u2022 Income documentation as stated in the overview section.  \n\u2022 Credit Report;  and, \n\u2022 Detailed budget . \n \nIf the borrower has been offered a loss mitigation solution based on full \ndocumentation in the last 12 months, the servicer can determine the borrower\u2019s ability/inability to support the debt based on the previous evaluation without obtaining new documentation.  \nAll of the following documentation pertaining to the subject property must be \nobtained:  \n\u2022   Appraisal  \n\u2022   Listing Agreement  \n\u2022   Sales Contract (if applicable)  \n\u2022  Closing Disclosure  \n\u2022  Title Report ; and \n\u2022 All P FS workouts must be accompanied by the \u201cDisposition (PFS/DIL) Cost \nBenefit Analysis\u201d ( Attachment 18 -B).

TIMING OF PFS ACTIONS  \nThe servicer should review for  a PFS, commences foreclosure, or initiates another \nloss mitigation option within six months of the date of default, unless the default is \ncured earlier.  \nIf the PFS follows a failed special forbearance agreement, the PFS, foreclosure or \nother option should be initiated within 90 days of the failure.  \nI. DURATION OF THE PFS PERIOD \nThe PFS period should be 90 days from the date of approval.  The servicer should \nreview the marketing efforts with the borrower each month.  After 90 days have passed without a scheduled closing, the servicer should discuss the likelihood of a sale with the real estate broker and decide if a 30 -day extension to the PFS is appropriate.  \nDocumentation of this decision is retained in the servicing notes.    \nIf the property is under contract at the end of the marketing period, the servicer \nmay extend the PFS period for 60 days, not to exceed a total of six  months.  \nThe pre -foreclosure option may also be extended to a borrower that has not \nreceived prior approval to participate in the PFS program.  A sales contract offer must be validated by an appraisal that is conducted by an appraiser not party to the transaction.  The appraisal must support the \u201cas is\u201d property value independent of the \ncurrent offer.  \nIf a closing of an approved PFS has not occurred within 90 days of the expiration of \nthe PFS period (or six  months of the date of default, whichever is later), the servicer \nshould automatically evaluate the borrower for a deed -in-lieu, and if not eligible, \ncommence foreclosure.  If the borrower\u2019s financial condition has improved significantly to the point that a cure of the delinquency is a viable option, the servicer may undertake a special forbearance agreement or a loan modification.  However, the servicer should fully justify this decision in the claim review file and approve the action within the 90 -\nday period.  \nJ. OTHER SERVICER ACTIONS  \nThe servicer is responsible for inspection, protection, and preservation of the \nproperty between the 45th day of default and the date it approves the borrower\u2019s PFS request.  Funds spent for preservation and protection may be reimbursed.  \n The servicer must provide any documents deemed pertinent to describe all servicing \nactions taken.  ",

The Property Sale Value Calculator  \nThe Agency has developed a Property Sale Value Calculator (PSVC) to determine the \nestimated sales price for REO loss claims .  The model coefficients use data on \napproximately 94,000 historical loss claims from the program.  The Agency updates the \nmodel coefficients on a regular basis using actual property sale values acquired through a third -party data provider.  The Agency adds historical data to the model every year and \nre-generates coefficients to ensure historical relationships between variables represent the \nmost recent data available and that the model produces accurate property value estimates.  \n \n19.4 CALCULATING NET RECOVERY VALUE  \nAs a part of the loss claim, the Agency will reimburse the servicer  for the difference \nbetween the loss incurred by the servicer  and the net recovery value of the property, \nwithin the limits of the guarantee.  N et recovery value is the amount the servicer  recovers \nfrom the sale of a property after accounting for all costs. Net recovery value is calculated differently for properties that have been sold than for properties that are in the servicer \u2019s \ninventory at the time the loss claim is filed.  For property that has already been sold, the actual net recovery value is used.  For property that remains in the servicer \u2019s inventory, \nthe estimated net recovery value  is used.  \nA. Properties Sold at Foreclosure  \nWhen the servicer  disposed of the property at the time of a loss claim submission , the \nactual net recovery value is calculated as the difference between:  \n\u2022 The proceeds from the sale and any other amounts recovered, such as recovered escrow funds; and  \n\u2022 Allowable liquidation and disposition costs.  \nB. Acquired Properties  \nThe Agency estimates the net recovery value on unsold REO as the difference \nbetween:  \n\u2022 The estimated value of the property based on the PSVC ;",

Loss claim checks \nor electronic funds transfer (EFT) payments will be issued to the servicer by the Agency within 60 days  of the servicer\u2019s properly filed loss claim.  Agency staff will notify the \nservicer of any additional documentation required and will note it in the loss claim file.  \nOnce all required information is submitted , the Agency must take the following \nactions:  \n\u2022 Determine whether the servicer  has fulfilled all SFHGLP  obligations and if not, \nwhether reduction or denial of the loss claim is warranted . \n\u2022 Review and approve the loss claim with an Agency designee  with appropriate \napproval authority.  \n\u2022 Advise the servicer  of the PSVC  (if applicable ) used to calculate the loss claim.  \n\u2022 Provide appropriate appeal rights for any adjustments, reductions, or denials with \nspecific reasons and clear explanation for the decision in accordance with \nAppendix 3 of this H andbook. \n\u2022 Issue payment.  \nPayment of the loss claim simultaneously fulfills and terminates the loan note \nguarantee.  A termination notice will be mailed to the designated payee  at the time of \npayment.   \n \nA. Reduction or Denial  of a Loss Claim  \nThe Agency will review each loss claim for adherence to program regulation and \nmake any reductions and/or denial of loss claim as noted below.  The Agency staff will use information provided by the servicer to determine if the loss claim should be adjusted or denied.  The Agency must show that any reduction to the servicer\u2019s loss claim \ncorresponds  with the servicer\u2019s action or failure to act.

Notification of Loss Payment Amount \nThe Agency should notify the servicer  in writing of the amount to be paid within \n60 days of receipt of a properly completed loss claim package.  If the loss claim has \nbeen reduced or denied, the Agency will provide a clear explanation of its decision, including an analysis of how the amount of any reduction was determined and provide notification of appeal rights  in accordance with Appendix 3 of this \nHandbook.  \n2. Payment and Post Payment Activities  \nPayment s for approved loss claims should be distributed within 60 days of receipt \nof a properly completed loss claim package.

Review  and Appeal  Options  \nAdverse Agency decisions against a program participant (lender, applicant, or \nborrower) may be reviewed or appealed by the National Appeals Division (NAD). \nAdverse  decisions  include  administrative  actions  taken  by Agency staff and the Agency\u2019s \nfailure to take required actions within time frames specified in statutes or regulations, or within a reasonable time if no deadline is specified.  7 CFR Part 11 provides procedures \nthat both Agency officials and program participants must follow during the review or appeal process.  Applicable portions of 7 CFR Part 11 to the Single -Family Housing \nGuaranteed Loan Program (SFHGLP) can be found later in this appendix.  Handbook \nLetters  1 through 7 are provided to inform program  participants  of their rights.  \nAdverse decisions are subject to the following review and appeal procedures:  \n \n\u2022 Informal Administrative Review by Agency Decision -Maker. Program \nparticipants  (participants) have  the right  to request  that any adverse  decision  be \nreviewed by the Agency staff member who made the adverse decision.  \n\u2022 Appeal  Request  to NAD.  Qualifying adverse  decisions  may be appealed  to \nNAD.  \n\u2022 Mediation  as a Form  of Alternative  Dispute  Resolution  (ADR).  Adverse \ndecisions which are appealable to NAD require the participant be given the opportunity to seek ADR prior to a hearing with NAD.  \nB. Informing  Program  Participants  of Their  Rights  \nAgency decisions that adversely affect a participant require written notification that \nan informal administrative review with the person who made the decision may be requested.  Letters notifying participants of adverse decisions must contain the \ninformation needed for the participant to make decisions regarding involvement in the review  and appeals  process.  Specific civil rights  language  also must  be included in these \nletters.  Handbook Letters  1 through 7 following  this appendix are available for guidance \nand are titled to assist in selecting the correct language for the decision made.  \nNotification  of adverse decisions  by the Agency will include  notification  to the lender \nand the applicant/borrower when declining a request for loan commitment. Adverse \ndecisions regarding loss payments will be directed to the servicer.  ",
  "page_395": "HB-1-3555  \nAppendix 3 \nPage  2 of 42 \n  \n If the decision is appealable, the participant will be informed of their opportunity to \nseek mediation and/or to request a hearing with NAD using Handbook Letter 1. If the \ndecision is not appealable, the participant will be informed of their rights to have NAD \nreview the accuracy of the Agency\u2019s finding that the decision cannot be appealed using Handbook Letter 2. When  a participant is denied assistance  for both appealable  and non- \nappealable decisions, the Agency will send both Handbook Letters 1 and 2. \nThe lender will be responsible for notifying the applicant or borrower if the lender \ndeclines an applicant  or borrower\u2019s  request.  Denial  of loan requests  or servicing actions \nby the lender are not subject to review or appeal rights.  \n \nC. Adverse Decisions That  Cannot  Be Appealed  \nCertain  decisions  made  by the Agency are not appealable and participants  can request \nan informal administrative review.  The participant will be informed through Handbook \nLetter 2 that they may request an informal administrative review for a review of the accuracy of the Agency\u2019s determination that the case cannot be appealed.  Decisions that \ncannot be appealed can include:  \n\u2022 Decisions made  by parties  not employed  by the Agency;  \n\u2022 Refusal  to request  an administrative  waiver;  \n\u2022 Decisions made  in accordance with statu te (such  as rural area designations);  and \n\u2022 Denial  of loan commitment  due to lack of program  funds.  \nD. Informal  Administrative  Review  \nThe purpose  of the informal administrative  review  is to reiterate the Agency\u2019s  reasons \nfor the adverse decision, provide a forum for the participant response, and obtain any \nadditional information to support the participant request.  \n\u2022 The written request for an informal administrative review must be provided to NAD  within  15 days of the date of the Agency\u2019s  letter notifying the participant of \nthe adverse decision.  \n\u2022 The informal administrative review can be conducted by telephone, webinar, or a face-to-face meeting  with the decision  maker  or their representative.  The Agency \nwill determine the meeting format.  \n\u2022 The review  of the decision must  be completed  within  45 days of the request.

If the decision is reversed, a \nletter will be  sent to  the participant notifying them  of the decision and next  steps.  \n\u2022 All documentation will be retained  in the electronic customer file  (ECF) . \nThe participant may  skip an informal  administrative  review  and,  if applicable, request \nmediation and/or an appeal. In doing so, the participant automatically waives their rights \nto an informal administrative review.  \nE. Mediation  \nAdverse  decisions  which  are appealable  to NAD also require  that the participant  have \nthe opportunity to seek mediation prior to having a hearing with NAD. The purpose of \nmediation is to resolve disputes using a neutral mediator.  A mediator\u2019s role is to \nsummarize each party\u2019s perception of the issues and offer procedural suggestions on a \nresolution which may lead to a mutual resolution of the adverse decision. The Agency \nwill not use the services of an arbitrator.  An arbitrator resolves disputes through hear ing \nboth parties  and renders  a binding decision. Participants may  skip mediation and request \nan appeal to NAD.  \nRequests for Mediation  \nAfter receiving  Handbook Letters  1 or 3 of this appendix, a  participant may  request \nmediation services.  Upon receipt of the participant\u2019s request for mediation, Handbook \nLetter 4 of this appendix is sent to the participant to begin the process.  \n \nCost of Mediation  \n \nCosts associated with mediation should be shared equally between the Agency and \nthe participant.  The selection of a mediator will be based on the most economically \nviable  alternative  to both  the Agency and participant. If Agency administrative  funds are \nexhausted, the Agency will notify the participant that mediation can proceed but the cost of mediation  will be absorbed fully  by the participant. The Agency should ensure  that all \nparticipants requesting mediation are treated consistently and pay the same percentage of the cost toward  this service.  The Agency may also consent  to pay a larger  percentage  (up \nto 100 percent) of the cost of mediation for participants with incomes below the poverty level.  The Agency will notify the mediation source of how the cost of such service will  ",

Handbook Letters  4 and 5 of this appendix include  language  to meet  this \nrequirement.  \nMediation  in States  with a USDA funded  mediation  program  \nMany States have a mediation program that is supported by grants provided by \nUSDA and a list of mediation providers is available at USDA Farm Service Agency  \nHome  Page  (usda.gov) . In States with a USDA  funded mediation  program, participants \nwho are provided appeal rights can be referred to the USDA  funded mediation program. \nMediation  in States  with a Community -Based  Mediation  Center (CBMC)  \nA CBMC is a nonprofit, public entity operating under the guidance of a governing \nboard. They  provide  an alternative  to the judicial system  using trained  mediators  and are \nan option when a USDA  funded State mediation program is unavailable. The State ADR \nCoordinator should establish a source list of CBMCs and include the director, contact \ninformation, and cost.  \nMediation  in States  without  a USDA funded  mediation  program  \nIn States without  a USDA funded mediation  program  or access to a CBMC,  the State \nADR coordinator is responsible for maintaining a list of mediation service providers.  \nThe list will contain  the approximate  cost of each service provider, if known. The \nAgency may handle the list of mediation sources as follows:  \n \n\u2022 The mediator list will be maintained alphabetically, and sources selected in sequential order to ensure that mediation providers receive an evenly balanced number  of referrals.  In the case where  mediators  have  a wide  range  of costs,  an \nemphasis will be placed on the lowest cost provider.  \n\u2022 The Agency may provide the list of mediators to the participant and request the participant  to select  the source  or provide  the name  of another  acceptable source \nof mediation services using Handbook Letter 4.  \n\u2022 The participant must  provide  the name  of a mediation  provider  within  10 days, \nor the request will be withdrawn.  Handbook Letter 7 will be used to notify the \nparticipant the withdrawal of the mediation request.  \n\u2022 Handbook letter 5 will be  used to refer  the case to the mediator.  \n\u2022 Withdrawal  or cancellation  of mediation  does not extinguish the participant\u2019s \nright to an appeal with NAD.

The Agency will not \nrefuse to participate in mediation if requested to do so by the participant.  \n\u2022 Mediation  occurs  prior to having a hearing  with NAD and stops  the clock  on the \n30-day period during which a participant may request and appeal to NAD. \n\u2022 Following mediation,  any days remaining  from the 30-day period are available to \nthe participant to request  an appeal  to NAD.  Handbook Letter 7 of this appendix \nis used for this purpose.  Hearing dates for participants who request mediation \nafter filing an appeal must be selected within 45 days of the conclusion of \nmediation.  \nMediation  on cases involving  the Servicing  Office  \nMediation on decisions made by the Servicing Office will be coordinated through \nwith the OPD and the State Office ADR coordinator.  When a participant receives \nHandbook Letters  1 or 3 of this appendix as a result of an adverse decision  made  by the \nServicing Office, the participant is referred to the Director of OPD to initiate mediation.  \nUpon receipt  of a participant\u2019s  request, the Agency will send Handbook Letters  4, 5, or 7 \nof this appendix, as applicable. A copy will be provided to the Single Family Housing \nAppeals Coordinator in the Servicing Office.  When Handbook Letter 5 is sent to the \nservice provider, the Agency contact will be the Servicing Office.  While the OPD \ncoordinates  this service,  the Servicing  Office  is responsible  for participating  in the actual \nmediation.  \nAppeals  \n\u2022 Participants  who wish  to appeal  an adverse decision  must  submit  a written  request \nto NAD within 30 days of receiving notice of an adverse decision. The request \nmust  be signed  by the participant  and include  a copy of the adverse decision and a \nbrief statement describing why the participant believes the decision is wrong.  \n\u2022 The Agency will promptly provide NAD with a copy of the Agency record, specific references  in 7 CFR Part 3555 to support  the decision, and any other \npertinent information.

In the first situation,  a Division  proceeding may in \nfact result in the adjudication of the rights of a third party, e.g., an appeal of a tenant involving a payment shared with a landlord, an appeal by one recipient of a portion of a payment shared by multiple parties, an appeal by one heir of an estate. In the second \nsituation, a party may desire to receive notice of and perhaps participate in an appeal because of the derivative impact the appeal determi nation will have on that party, e.g., \nguaranteed lenders and reinsurance companies.  The provisions in this section set forth \nrules for the participation of such third and interested parties.  \n(a) Third parties.  When an appeal is filed, the Division shall notify any potential third \nparty whose rights may be adjudicated of its right to participate as an appellant in the appeal. This includes the right to seek Director review of the Hearing Officer determination.  Such third parties may be identified by the Division itself, by an \nagency, or by the original appellant. The Division shall issue one notice to the third \nparty of its right to participate, and if such party declines to participate, the Divisio n \ndetermination will be binding as to that third party as if it had participated.  For \npurposes  of this part, a third  party  includes  any party  for which  a determination  of the \nDivision could lead to an agency action on implementation that would be adverse to the party thus giving such party a right to a Division appeal.  \n(b) Interested  parties.  With  respect  to a participant  who is a borrower  under  a guaranteed \nloan or an insured under a crop insurance program, the respective guaranteed lender of reinsurance company having an interest in a participant\u2019s appeal under this part may participate in the appeal as an interested party, but such participation does not \nconfer the status of an appellant upon the guaranteed lender or reinsurance company such that it may request Director review of a final determination of the Division.

Beyond 1991, interest assist ance was not offered in connection with a \nSFHGLP guarantee.  A relatively  small number of loans providing interest assistance are still \nactive.  For those lenders who have interest assistance guarantees in their portfolio, it is \nimportant to administer the remaining loans corr ectly.  Section 1, Interest Assistance, provides \ninstructions for conducting annua l and interim review s, calculating intere st assistance, and \npaying the lender\u2019s processing f ee.  Section 2 of this Appe ndix provides guidance on what \ntriggers recapture and how it is calculated. \n \nSECTION 1:  INTER EST ASSISTANCE  \nAGREEMENTS \nThe lender is responsible for conducting annua l and interim reviews of household income \nto ensure that the household conti nues to be eligible to  receive interest assi stance, and that the \namount of the assistance  provided is correct.  Form RD 3555-13, \u201cAnnual Interest Assistance \nAgreement ,\u201d is used to determine the amount of assistance for the coming year.  The Agency\u2019s \nDeputy Chief Financial Officer, St . Louis, Missouri generates to  lenders on an annual basis a \nNotice of SFH Interest Assistance Expiring within 90 Days which provides lenders with a list of \nexpiring interest assistance agre ements within the ensuing 90 da ys.  A copy of this notice is \nprovided to the Agency office.  The lender provides Form RD 3555-13  to the borrower, who fills \nout Section II, signs the form, attaches any requi red documentation, and returns it to the lender.  \nWhen the borrower returns the form to the lender , the lender verifies sources and amounts and \ndetermines adjusted income. \n The lender then submits Form RD 3555-13  to the Agency for approval, and the Agency \nreviews the lender\u2019s calculations.  If any errors are found, the Agen cy will contact the lender and \nprovide guidance on the nece ssary corrective actions.  It is the lender\u2019s re sponsibility to resolve \nany inconsistencies with the borrower.   \n In the case of a transfer/assumption, approved by the Agency, in accordance with Chapter \n17 of this handbook, interest assist ance may be granted to the tran sferor provided the eligibility \ncriteria of this appendix are met and the transferor executes Form RD 3555-12, \u201cMaster Interest \nAssistance and Shared Equity Agreement with Promissory Note .\u201d  ",
  "page_446": "HB-1-3555 \nAppendix 6 \nPage 2 of 17 \n            \n  PROCESSING FEE \nThe Agency will reimburse the lender in the amount of $40.00 for the cost of processing \nForm RD 3555-13 whether or not the agreement results in  continued assistance.  The Agency \nwill pay the fee upon receipt of a valid agreement if: \n \n\uf0b7 A new agreement is made at the annual renewal date;  \n\uf0b7 The borrower has a change in circumstances that requires a revision to the current \nagreement.  However, a processing fee will not be paid when the revision to an \nexisting agreement is required due to an error on the part of the lender or \nborrower; or  \n\uf0b7 The borrower is eligible for but not presentl y on interest assistance and enters into \na new Form RD 3555-13 . \nANNUAL AND INTERIM REVIEWS \nAnnual Reviews \nThe lender must review annually each bo rrower receiving interest assistance to \ndetermine whether the household is eligible to continue to receive in terest assistance, and \nwhether any adjustments need to be made.

At the time of  loan closing, the borrower will have signed Form \nRD 3555-12 which requires repayment of some or the en tire subsidy when the borrower ceases to \noccupy the property or transfers titl e.  The purpose of this policy is  to provide borrowers with the \nopportunity to realize a benefit from increased equity in their properties, while requiring \nrepayment of a portion of the assistance received if the borrower has reali zed value appreciation. \n \nTRIGGERING RECAPTURE \nGeneral Rule \nInterest assistance subject to recapture must be repaid whenever the borrower ceases to \noccupy the property or transfers titl e.  If the borrower is absent from the property temporarily for \nreasons such as seasonal or migratory employment , military duty, or hospitalization, recapture is \nnot triggered. ",
  "page_452": "HB-1-3555 \nAppendix 6 \nPage 8 of 17 \n Exceptions \nWhen a loan is assumed in connection with a transfer, recapture will not be calculated or \ncollected at that time.  When the new borrower tr ansfers title or ceases to occupy the property, all \ninterest assistance subject to r ecapture from both before and after the assumption must be repaid. \n Generally, when a loan is foreclosed the Agen cy will not require the recapture of interest \nassistance.  However, recapture is required if: \n \n\uf0b7 The property is sold at or prior to foreclosure for an amount exceeding the \nlender\u2019s unpaid balance and co sts of foreclosure; or \n\uf0b7 A junior lienholder takes over the lender\u2019s loan. \nLender Responsibilities \nThe lender is responsible for collecting the am ount of recapture due from the borrower.  \nWhen recapture is triggered, the lender must  notify the Agency and request information \nregarding the amount of interest assistance that could be subject to recapture.  Agency staff will \nobtain the amount of interest a ssistance from the Guaranteed Loan System account records and \nthe average interest rate paid fr om the Deputy Chief Financial Offi ce in St. Louis, Missouri.  The \nlender must then notify the borrower of the ma ximum potential recapture amount and offer the \nborrower an opportunity to provide the information needed to calculate a reduced amount.  If an \nentity other than the Agency provides assistance to a borrower and requires recapture, collection \nof the Agency\u2019s recapture amounts has prio rity over recapture by the other entity. \n The recapture amount is calculated based on a projected payoff date.  If the actual payoff \ndate is different than the date used to cal culate the recapture amount, the borrower may be \nentitled to a refund, or may owe an  additional amount.  If the borro wer is entitled to a refund, the \nAgency will provide the lender with the reimbur sement.  If the borrower owes an additional \namount, the lender must collect the remaining fu nds and submit them to the Agency before \nreleasing the security instruments.   Security instruments must not  be released until the Agency \nreceives and verifies the recapture payment. \nSHARED EQUITY DETERMINATION - CALCULATING RECAPTURE \nEven though the Agency will calc ulate the recapture amount, it is important for lenders to \nunderstand the recapture calculation well enough to  explain to borrowers, should they have \nquestions.

They borrowed $50,000 through a 30 year guaranteed loan and paid the remaini ng $500 of the purchase price and $1,000 for closing \ncosts out of their savings. \nThe Potters\u2019 note rate is 7 percent, but they received interest assistance with a reduced \ninterest rate of 4 percent for th e first 5 years.  Then John got a big promotion, at which point the \nPotters were no longer eligible for interest assistance. \nLast year, the Potters added a deck.  The materials cost $1,250, but since they built it \nthemselves, there were no labor costs. \nSharon just got a great new job, and the family  is selling the house a nd moving to a larger \nhome.  They are working with Big Bank to finance the new home.  They are putting down $5,000, paying $1,000 in points, and are financin g the rest of the closing costs. \nIn preparation for selling the house, the Potters spent $3,000 on new wall-to-wall \ncarpeting and installed a new high- efficiency water heater for $500. \nThe Potters have found buyers for their hous e and have signed a sales contract for \n$65,000.

CAIVRS alerts participating Federal lending agencies when an applicant for credit benefits, or for a position of  trust in support of the administration of a Federal credit \nprogram, has a Federal lien, judgment , or a Federal loan that is currently in default or \nforeclosure, or has had a claim paid by a reporting  agency. \n \nWhat does it do? \n \nCAIVRS allows authorized employees of participating Federal agencies and \napproved private lenders acting on the Government\u2019s behalf to access a database of delinquent Federal borrowers for the purpose of pre -screening applicants for credit \nworthiness for f ederal assistance.  \n \nHow does it work? \n \nCAIVRS has delinquent borrower records from the Department of Housing and \nUrban Development (HUD), the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the Department of Education (DOE), the Department of Agriculture (USDA), the Small Business Administration (SBA), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and the Department of Justice (DOJ). Authorized users may access CAIVRS via the Internet.  \n \nHow does CAIVRS relate to Government Financial Management?  \n \nFederal law prevents \u201cdelinquent Federal debtors from obtaining Federal loans or \nloan insurance guarantees.\u201d CAIVRS provides a single repository of delinquent Federal debtor records with easy access through a variety of media for pre- screening applicants \nfor Federal benefits. Most credit bureau reports do not identify insured debts as being \ndelinquent Federal debts. By participating in CAIVRS, Federal lending agencies have ready access to an interdepartmental database of delinquent Federal debts that provid e \nFederal financial managers with the information necessary to comply with the U.S. Code requirements.  \n  \n ",
