The Agency will make nonprogram loans to:  \n \n\u2022 Allow the assumption of an existing program loan on new rates and terms;  or \n\u2022 Expedite the sale of a Real Estate Owned (REO) property.  \nUnless otherwise specified in this chapter, nonprogram loan applications should be \naccepted, evaluated, and closed following the procedures described for Section 502 loans in Chapters 2 through 10. For a summary of the differences between program and nonprogram loans, see Attachment 11 -A. \n \nA. Nonprogram  Assumptions  \n \nWhen an existing Agency borrower \nwishes to sell a security property, the Agency will assist that borrower by allowing any creditworthy buyer to assume the outstanding Section 502 debt, even if the purchaser is not eligible for a program loan or the property does  \nnot qualify as a program property. This helps the borrower sell the property and reduce the chances that the borrower will default without requiring the Agency to obligate new funds. The amount assumed is reamortized over a full new loan period.  \n \nB. Nonprogram Loans to Purchase REO Property  \n \nWhen the Agency has REO property to dispose of and funding is available, credit may be \nextended on nonprogram terms in order to facilitate the sale of the prope rty. Field Staff should \nconsult with the State Office to ensure that funds for nonprogram REO sales are available before offering credit. Nonprogram credit may only be offered after the expiration of any restriction \nperiod on program properties.  Chapter 16 provides additional guidance on REO sales. \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n11-1 \n(01-23-03)  SPECIAL PN  \nRevised ( 03-09-22) SPECIAL PN  \nCHAPTER 11: NONPROGRAM LOANS [7 CFR 3550.74]  \nSame Rate and Terms Assumptions  \nIn certain cases, generally those involving \ntransfers of title between family members, a loan \nmay be assumed under the same rates and terms by \nsomeone who is not program -eligible.  However, \nsuch a loan is not considered a nonprogram loan . ",
  "page_2": "HB-1-3550 \n \n11.2 PRE- QUALIFICATION \n \nThe pre -qualification step is substantially the same as for program loans, as described in \nSection 1 of Chapter 3. When a potential applicant expresses interest in nonprogram credit, the \nLoan Originator explains the Agency\u2019s nonprogram requirements and uses UniFi to determine \nwhether the potential applicant has adequate repayment ability. Although the potent ial applicant \nmay submit an application regardless of the outcome of the pre -qualification, this step can save \nthe applicant and Agency staff time in the long run by letting potential applicants know in advance about any reasons they may not be eligible for a nonprogram loan.  \n \n11.3 APPLICATION PROCESSING  \n \nThis step is substantially similar to the process for a program loan described in Section 2 \nof Chapter 3. The nonprogram applicant must submit Form RD 410- 4, Uniform Residential \nLoan Application. The Loan Origi nator then determines whether the application is complete, \nasks follow up questions needed to understand the applicant\u2019s situation, and conducts a preliminary credit check, as described in Paragraph 4.11. The Loan Originator then makes a preliminary eligib ility determination and notifies the applicant.  \n \nUnlike applicants for program loans, applicants for nonprogram credit must submit a \nnonrefundable $100 application fee. However, this fee cannot be collected prior to issuing the \nLoan Estimate to nonprogram applicants, in accordance with Paragraph 3. 8. The application fee \nis waived for applicants who are public bodies or nonprofit organizations.  \n \n11.4 ELIGIBILITY  \n \nNonprogram applicants are not subject to the income eligibility, asset, citizenship, or \noccupancy requirements described in Chapter 4 for program borrowers. They may own other \nproperties and are not required to first seek private sources of financing. However, they must \ncomply with other requirements found in Section 4 of Chapter 4 relating t o legal capacity, \ntruthful applications, and suspension or debarment, and must meet the credit requirements \noutlined in Section 3 of Chapter 4.  \n \n11.5 PROPERTY REQUIREMENTS  \n \nProperties financed with nonprogram loans are not required to meet the site and dwelling \nrequirements described in Sections 1 and 2 of Chapter 5, but are required to meet the environmental requirements described in Section 3 of Chapter 5.  Chapter 16 describes \ndisclosure and documentation requirements for REO properties being disposed of that  are not \ndecent, safe, and sanitary or that may contain hazards.  \n \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n11-2 ",
  "page_3": "HB-1-3550 \n11.6 UNDERWRITING THE LOAN  \n \nA. Down Payment  Requirement  \n \nNonprofit organizations and State and local governments are not required to contribute a \ndown payment.  Other nonprogram applicants are required to make a down payment.  \nNonprogram borrowers who intend to occupy the property must contribute 2 percent of the \npurchase price. Nonprogram borrowers who do not intend to occupy the property must \ncontribute  5 percent of the purchase price.  \n \nB. Amount to be  Financed \n \nFor assumptions, Agency credit is limited to the lesser of the sales price or the amount of \nthe existing borrower\u2019s outstanding debt, less the purchaser\u2019s down payment. If the purchaser \nrequires add itional funds to purchase the property, the funds must come from another source.  \n \nFor REO sales, Agency credit is limited to the sales price, less the purchaser\u2019s down \npayment. Closing costs and fees, tax service fees, and any required initial deposit to t he escrow \naccount cannot be financed. \n \nC. Interest Rate  \n \nThe interest rate charged for nonprogram loans is the nonprogram rate in \neffect at the time of loan approval. Nonprogram rates can be found in Exhibit B of \nRD Instruction 440.1. \n \nD. Loan Repayment Period  \n \nThe repayment period for nonprogram loans depends on whether the applicant intends to \npersonally occupy the property.  \n \nFor nonprogram applicants who intend to personally occupy the property, the maximum \nloan term is 30 years. If an applicant alread y has a nonprogram loan, a new 30- year loan is not \npermitted, even if the applicant intends to occupy the new property.  \n \nFor nonprogram applicants who do not intend to personally occupy the property, the \nmaximum loan term is 10 years. If more favorable ter ms are necessary to facilitate the sale, the \nloan may be amortized over a period of up to 20 years, with payment in full due not later than 10 years from the date of closing.  \n \n  \n \n \n \n \n \n11-3 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL PN  \nRevised ( 03-09-22) SPECIAL PN ",
  "page_4": "HB-1-3550 \nParagraph 11.6  Underwriting the Loan  \n \nE. Repayment Ability  \n \nChapter 6 provides detailed guidance on the use of the principal, interest, taxes, and \ninsurance (PITI) and total debt (TD) ratios. For nonprogram applicants the ratios permitted \ndepend upon whether the applicant intends to personally occupy the property. For nonprogram applicants who intend to personally occupy the property, the PITI ratio must not exceed 33 \npercent of repayment income, and the TD ratio must not exceed 41 percent. For nonp rogram \napplicants who do not intend to occupy the property, the TD ratio must not exceed 41 percent. \nNo analysis of the PITI ratio is required.  \n \n11.7 LOAN APPROVAL AND CLOSING  \n \nAs with program loans, once the Loan Originator has completed the underwriting \nanalysis, loans recommended for approval are forwarded to the Loan Approval Official. When the loan is approved, the applicant selects a closing agent who conducts title clearance, reviews security requirements to verify that they conform to the Agency\u2019s standards, and works with the Loan Originator to ensure that all required closing documents are prepared for signature at \nclosing.  \n \nBecause the same closing forms are used for both program and nonprogram borrowers, \nthe Loan Originator must modi fy the security instruments, promissory note, and, if applicable, \nthe assumption agreement to delete:  \n \n\u2022 Any conditions related to financing or refinancing with other credit, restrictions on \nleasing, and consent to junior lien encumbrances;  and \n \n\u2022 Any references to borrower eligibility for payment subsidies and special servicing \nactions.  \n \nChapter 8 provides detailed instructions for closing both program and nonprogram loans. \n \n11.8 SERVICING NONPROGRAM  LOANS  \n \nAfter closing, the Loan Originator activates the l oan in LoanServ and prepares a loan \ndocket to send to the Servicing and Asset Management Office (Servicing Office)  for servicing, \nas described in Chapter 8.  Nonprogram borrowers are not subject to periodic reviews of their ability to refinance with private credit and are not eligible for payment subsidies, moratoriums, \nor subsequent loans.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n11-4 ",
