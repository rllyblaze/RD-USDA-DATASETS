Loan  funds  are available \nfor repairs to improve or modernize a home, make it safer or more sanitary, or remove health and \nsafety hazards.  For homeowners that are 62 years  of age and old er, grant funds are available to \nremove health or safety hazards, or remodel dwellings to make them accessible to a household member with a disability.   Attachment  12-A, of this Chapter, provides  a summary  of the differences  \nbetween  Section  504 loans  and Section  504 grants , Attachment 12 -B, of this Chapter, provides the \ndifferences between Section 502 and Section 504 loans , Attachment  12-C provides  a processing and \nclosing checklist , Attachment  12-D, of this Chapter, provides  a checklist for assessment of an existing \ndwelling , Attachment 12 -E provides items included with a complete application , and Attachment 12 -\nF, of this Chapter, provides a pre -construction checklist. \nThe procedures  that differ from  Section  502 loans  are described  in this chapter.  \nUnless otherwise specified in this chapter, Section 504 loan/grant applications should be accepted, evaluated, and closed following the same procedures described for Section 502 loans in Chapters 2 through 10 of this Handbook.\n However, Section 504 loans cannot be assumed \nexcept on Same Rates  and Terms  as described  in Chapter 2 Paragraph  2.4 B  of this Handbook.  \nIn addition, a property  survey  is not required for a Section 504 loan or grant unless a mortgage \nor deed of trust is being filed and there is a compelling reason  to question the placement  of the \ndwelling  on the property;  or, in farm  acreage cases, where the house site is subdivided from a \nlarger parcel.  The cost of a survey can be included in the loan if there is sufficient equity.  \n \n12.2 ELIGIBLE PURPOSES  FOR  504 FUNDS  [7 CFR  3550.102]  \nSection 504 loan funds may be used to make general repairs to improve or modernize the \nproperty (including a new addition to an existing home), as long as the dwelling remains modest. Loan Originators may approve any of the eligible costs listed in Chapter 6 Paragraph 6.4 of this Handbook, unless specifically prohibited in 7 CFR  3550 and this chapter.  In limited  circumstances,  \nfunds  may be used to refinance an Agency loan as a special servicing action (subject to the \navailability of funds and Agency priorit ies) such as at the end of a moratorium. Directives will be \nprovided for usage of this option as Agency priorities are determined.  \nSection 504 grant funds may be used only for repairs and improvements that will remove \nhealth  and safety  hazards,  or to repair  or remodel  dwellings  to make them  accessible and useable  for a \nhousehold member with a disability.  A hazard  is a property condition that jeopardizes the health or \nsafety of the occupants or members of the community, but that does not make it unfit for habitation. \nA major hazard is a condition so severe that it makes the property unfit for habitation. \n \n \n12-1 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL  PN \nRevised  (05-05-25) PN 640\n \nCHAPTER  12: SECTION  504 LOANS  AND  GRANTS  ",

The Non- Purchase Loan Estimate \nand Closing Disclosures should be utilized for 504 loans where a security interest will be taken. For unsecured loans (i.e., the total Section 504 indebtedness is less than $7,500), \nForm RD 1940- 41, \u201c Truth in Lending Statement \u201d is required.  \nThe Loan  Originator  will send Handbook Letter  11 , Appendix 3 of this Handbook, \nRequest  Information, to the applicant requesting any missing items and stating that their \napplication will be withdrawn if the  missing  information  is not received  within  15 days (30 \ndays may  be allotted  if the applicant is waiting for repair estimate (s)). A complete Section 504 \napplication includes applicable items listed on Attachment 12 -E, of this Chapter, checklist.  \nThe Loan  Approval  Official  should make a determination  of eligibility  within  30 days \nof receiving a complete loan application. When funding is available, a pre -construction \nconference should be scheduled within 30 days of  an eligibility determination and loan/grant \napproval.  Attachment 12 -F, of this Chapter, is utilized to document the pre -construction \nconference.  \nIf funds are insufficient to continue  processing an application from an applicant  who \nhas been determined eligible, the applicant should be notified using Handbook Letter 2 (3550), Waiting Period and follow up with Handbook Letter 3- A Appendix 3 of this \nHandbook, Waiting Period (Funds Not Available) as applicable (see Exhibit 3- 2 of Chapter 3 \nof this Handbook) .  If an eligibility determination cannot be made within 30 days of \nreceiving a complete application, Handbook Letter 3- B Appendix 3 of this Handbook, \nWaiting Period (Extended Processing Timeframe), will be sent to the applicant with the  \napproximate waiting period until an eligibility determination can be made  and follow up with \nanother Handbook Le tter 3 -B as applicable (see Exhibit 3 -of Chapter 3 of this Handbook).  \nSection  504 applications  requesting assistance  to remove  health  or safety  hazards  should \nreceive priority processing.

Income  \nTo be eligible for a Section 504 loan or grant, the adjusted income at the time of \nloan/grant approval and at loan closing must not exceed  the applicable  very low-income limit. \nLow-income applicants cannot receive assistance under Section 504. \nMedical deductions in excess of 3% of annual income should be closely examined and \napplied to elderly applications, as described in HB-1-3550, Chapter 4 Paragraph 4.4 G of this Chapter . Consider the following unreimbursed ongoing/projected medical  expenses;  Medicare \npremiums,  supplemental insurance, long- term care insurance, prescription drug coverage, \npharmacy expenses, co - payments, eyewear,  hearing aid / batteries,  exams,  monthly payments for \nmedical  bills,  disability expenses, in home care expenses,  dental expenses,  including the greater  of \nthe actual  travel  costs for medical  appointments or the published Internal  Revenue Service  \nmileage  rate. You may not deduct funeral or burial expenses, nonprescription medicines, \ntoothpaste, toiletries, cosmetics, a trip, or program for the general improvement of your health, or most cosmetic surgery. Additional guidance on eligible  medical  expenses  can be located  on the Internal Revenue Service \nwebsite.  \nB. Credit  Requirements  \nApplicants receiving grant only funding do not need a credit history evaluation.  An \napplicant  with an outstanding judgment obtained by the United  States  in a Federal  court, other \nthan in the United States Tax Court, is not eligible for a Section 504 grant or 504 loan. \nFor loans, applicants must have a credit history that indicates a reasonable ability and \nwillingness to meet debt obligations.  Applicants with a credit score of 620 or higher, do not \nrequire  Form  RD 1944-61, \u201c Credit  History  Worksheet, \u201d or further evaluation.  These \napplicants are considered to have acceptable  credit  histories,  with the exception  for loan \napplicant(s)  with a significant delinquency described in Chapter 4 Paragraph 4.12 A, of this \nHandbook, or delinquency of a federal debt. \nFor loans, to assist the Agency with verifying a non-purchasing spouse\u2019s obligations in \ncommunity property states, the applicant\u2019s non-purchasing spouse must provide a credit report or reports from each of the three nationwide consumer credit companies \u2013 Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion as described in HB-1-3550, Chapter 4 Paragraph 4.12 D of this Handbook. \nCommunity property states include: Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New \nMexico, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin.  Puerto Rico allows property to be owned as community property as do several Indian jurisdictions.  Alaska is an opt-in community property state, where property is separate unless both parties agree to make it community property through a community property agreement or community property trust.  As laws vary from state to state, Loan Originators should contact the appropriate Office of General Counsel with questions regarding the consideration of a non-purchasing spouse\u2019s credit history. \n \n____________________________________________________________________________________ \n12-5 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL PN  \nRevised  (05-05-25) PN  640",

An applicant with  a \ncredit score less than 620 must demonstrate a history of reliable traditional or non- traditional \ncredit using Form RD 1944-61, \u201cCredit History Worksheet\u201d to conduct the credit analysis. \nThe indicators of unacceptable credit  described  in Chapter 4 Exhibit 4-4, of this \nHandbook, for Section  502 loans can  be used to evaluate the applicant\u2019s  credit  history; \nhowever, general  credit  requirements may be less stringent than those for Section 502 \nloans.  Late payments for housing costs should not be considered as an indicator of \nunacceptable credit.  \nThe Loan  Originator  will check  Department  of Treasury\u2019s  Do Not Pay (DNP)  portal, as \ndescribed in  Chapter 4 Paragraph 4.11 of this Handbook for loan and grant requests. Infile \ncredit reports will be required for applicant(s) receiving a 504 loan assistance. A Tri -Merge \nCredit Report (TMCR) is required for all applications for loans of $7,500 or greater, but the \ncost of the report is not charged to the applicant.  A TMCR is not required to deny a loan request of less than $7,500. \n \nC. Asset  Requirements  \n \nAsset  requirements  are identical  to those imposed by Section  502, except  only assets  that \ncan be converted to cash in 60 days or less are included in the calculation of non- retirement \nassets.  Non-retirement assets  in excess of $15,000 (or $20,000 for an elderly household), must \nbe used to reduce the Section 504 request. \nAn applicant\u2019s  home equity should not be considered in the asset calculation and should \nnot be used as a test for other credit.  \n \nD. Repayment  Ability  \n \nTo qualify for a Section 504 loan, the applicant must have a reliable income source \nsufficient to allow repayment of the loan as supported by a budget.  A budget is defined by \nusing a maximum Total  Debt  (TD)  ratio of 41%. Non-taxable income  is not \u201cgrossed  up\u201d for \nthe Section 504 program.  \n \nE. Age for Section  504 Grants  \nAt least one qualified applicant must be 62 or older for a household to receive grant \nassistance.   A qualified  applicant  with an eligible  grant purpose may receive grant funds first \n(up to the lifetime limit).   If grant funds are not enough to cover the needed repairs, the \napplicant\u2019s loan repayment ability will be calculated (see Paragraph 12.5 D of this Chapter ). \nF. Ownership  of Property   \n \nThe applicant  must own and occupy the property  to be eligible  for Section  504 funds, and \nmust be able to document ownership, as described in Chapter 5 Paragraph 5.11 of this Handbook, with 3 exceptions: \nLeasehold  Interest: For Section  504 loans, the property must be covered  by a lease with \nan unexpired portion of not less than 2 years beyond the term of the promissory note, and for grants, the remaining lease period must be at least 5 years. \n \n \n12-6  ",

The property  must be considered  typical  and modest for \nthe area and must not be used for rental or other income producing purposes.  However, Section \n504 loan or grant funds may be used  to improve a home on a property that has income-producing \nland or a small business, if the loan or grant is only used to improve the applicant\u2019s residence. \nThe property must be deemed a single- family  housing residential unit.  The Agency \nwill not use 504 program funds to improve multi- family  housing, or accessory  dwelling  units \n(see Chapter 5 Paragraph 5.6 D.2, of this Handbook).  \nA modest dwelling may not have an estimated or appraised value that is greater \nthan the applicable  area loan limit unless waived  by the State  Director.

Determining  Property  Value   \nThe Loan Approval Official will determine whether an appraisal is needed to assure \nadequate  security  exists  for the  proposed loan.  An appraisal  is never required for an \nunsecured loan.  An appraisal is  required  when  the sum  of all secured  (RD or non-RD) \nindebtedness, including the proposed repair loan, exceeds $25,000. Section 504 applicants \nare required to pay an appraisal fee if an appraisal is deemed necessary.  The cost of the \nappraisal  fee is described  in Chapter 5 Paragraph  5.20 of this Handbook and may be included \nin the 504 loan amount. \nIf an appraisal  is not required,  the value  and the method used to develop the estimate \nshould be documented in the running record.  Utilization of tax assessments, and real estate websites such as Zillow.com, Trulia.com and Realtor.com may be considered as a tool to estimate the value of security.  Appraisals are required when issuing an adverse \naction based on inadequate value of security.  \nC. Construction  Standards   \nDwellings repaired with Section 504 loan or grant funds must remain modest and all \nwork  must  be completed  in accordance with local  codes  and standards.  They  do not need  to be \nbrought up to Agency development standards, nor must all of the existing hazards be removed, provided the property does not continue  to have  major  health  or safety  hazards  after the planned \nrepairs are made. Refer to Section 6, Chapter 5 of this Handbook for all construction \nmanagement information. \n \nD. Environmental  Requirements  \nSection  504 loans  and grants  are subject  to the same environmental  requirements  as \nSection 502 loans, as described in Section 3 of Chapter 5 of this Handbook.  \n \n \n12.7 INTEREST RATE  AND LOAN TERM  [7 CFR 3550.113]  \nSection  504 loans  have an interest  rate of 1 percent  and a term of 20 years.  \nSection  504 loans  are amortized  on a monthly basis.

In the case of a life estate interest or an undivided ownership interest, as described in Chapter 5, Paragraph 5.11 of this Handbook, all co -owners living or planning to live in the household must \nsign Form RD 3550- 24.\n The original Form RD 3550- 24 should be filed with the promissory \nnotes in a locked cabinet with a copy to the recipient\u2019s  electronic customer  file, and a copy \nprovided to the recipient.

Documentation  of Grants  \nTo ensure  that any one household or one dwelling  does not receive more  than the maximum \nallowable grant assistance, the Loan Originator must document the amount of any prior grant \nprovided to each homeowner or dwelling.  Since 1998, grant records have been maintained in \nLoanServ.  A list of  grants  closed  prior  to 1998  will be retained  in the state operational  file folder \n3550- C, \"Section 504 Grantee List.\"  When processing grant applications for individuals born \nprior to 1936, both LoanServ and the operational file folder will be checked to document if prior assistance was received.\n For all other grant applications, LoanServ must be checked by \nindividual and by dwelling address.  A dwelling that received past maximum grant assistance \nmay only receive a new grant if ownership has changed.  \n12.11  ESCROW,  TAXES,  AND  INSURANCE  [7 CFR  3550.109, 7 CFR 3550.110]  \nIf the total outstanding indebtedness is more than $15,000, Section 504 borrowers are \nresponsible  for furnishing and maintaining  hazard  insurance,  as described  in Section  3 of Chapter  \n7 of this Handbook.  If funds are not escrowed through another lender to pay for taxes and \ninsurance,  the borrower must contribute the appropriate amount to an escrow account managed \nby the Agency.  Escrow is also not required where the security property includes a farm,  and the \nproperty is not subdivided between  the farm  and non-farm  tract unless  the housing represents  the \nmajority  of the value of  the security property, or it is in the Agency\u2019s best interest.  \nFlood insurance  is required  when  any form  of federal  financial  assistance  which  is intended \nin whole or in part for the acquisition, construction, reconstruction, or substantial improvement of any building located  in a Special  Flood Hazard  Area,  as identified  by the National  Flood Insurance \nProgram, administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and described in RD Instruction 426.2.  Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or \nother improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of  the structure  (a) before  the start of  construction of the  improvement, or (b) if  the structure \nhas been  damaged  and is being restored,  before  the damage occurred  (see Chapt er 7, Section  3 of \nthis Handbook for further information on calculating substantial improvements ). \n \n \n12-11 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL  PN \nRevised  (05-05-25) PN  640  ",

Typically, the repairs, \nimprovements, or minor rehabilitation (work) discussed within this section would be able to be \ncompleted within 30 days of it commencing.  If work will take more than 30 days, the loan must \nbe processed and coded as \u2018construction\u2019 (e.g., interest deferral period and subsequent conversion \nto a permanent loan).  \nA. Communicating  the Standards  \nIt is the applicant\u2019s  responsibility  to be aware of  the standards  the local  jurisdiction  has in \nplace for repairs or improvements to their home before the design or estimate  process progresses.  \nContractors should be provided with a scope of work by the applicant to ensure that the repair \nestimates  for labor  and materials  are consistent  with the homeowners\u2019  expectations.  If application \nfees and permits are required, the scope of work will identify the party responsible for submitting the permit fees and approval from the local jurisdiction. \nB. Selecting  the Contractor  \n \nWhile the Agency does not approve contractors, the Agency may provide applicants with \nsound advice on selecting a contractor (e.g., encouraging competitive estimate , checking \nreferences, Better Business Bureau review, etc.).  The Loan Originator should discuss any \nconcerns from their initial review with the homeowner to assist with  their contractor selection \ndecision.  The Loan  Originator  should document  in the running record  which  contractor(s)  the \nhomeowner selected.  \n \nThe contractor  must  be checked  in the Do Not Pay Portal  and have a valid  contractor\u2019s \nlicense if required  by the local  jurisdiction,  and such license must  be documented  by the Loan \nOriginator (e.g., contractor provided verification or online search, when available).  In many \ncases, the applicant will have a contractor in mind.  The contractor\u2019s estimate  should include a \nbreakdown of materials and labor and describe the quantity, quality, grades, styles, model numbers, etc. to identify the work and materials to be furnished.  \nThe applicant  will provide  an adequate number  of estimate (s) from  a qualified  contractor(s).  \nThe local office must review the estimate (s) obtained to ensure costs are reasonable for the area \nserviced  and the number  of estimate (s) are sufficient.  Online  construction cost comparison tools  \nmay be used when appropriate.\n The estimate (s) must be detailed to include cost of material, \nsize, quantity, and manufacturer.  \n \n \n \n \n12-12 \n \n  \n \n  ",

Pre-Construction  Conference  \nOnce the funding has been obligated, the Agency, the applicant(s), and the contractor(s) are \nrequired to hold a pre -construction conference using Attachment 12- F, of this Chapter , Pre-Construction \nConference prior to work commencing. The purpose  of the conference is to ensure  that each party  \nunderstands  their respective roles and responsibilities.  The parties should review the contract or \naccepted contractors estimate /proposal, start date,  estimated  completion  date,  requirements,  and \nspecifications  to ensure  all parties  understand the scope of work, construction/thermal standards, \nenvironmental mitigation requirements, fees, materials,  inspection requirements, change orders, \nresponsibilities for access, cleanup, and payment procedures. Along with  the RD Representative,  the \napplicant/owner  and the contractor  should sign Attachment  12-F of this Chapter . Alternatively,  the \napplicant/owner  and the contractor  can acknowledge the  pre-construction conference  via an email  \nexchange that includes the completed Attachment 12 -F of this Chapter  with the RD Representative\u2019s \nsignature.  \nD. Construction  Contract  \nWritten contracts using Form RD 1924- 6, \u201cConstruction Contract\u201d are strongly \nrecommended  for all rehabilitation -related  construction and are required  if the contract or \nestimate will be greater than $10,000 and when construction work will affect the dwelling\u2019s \nstructural integrity (widening doorways, removing walls, foundation work, termite/water \ndamage, etc.).  A contract or estimate  not exceeding $10,000 may use Form RD 1924- 6, \n\u201cConstruction Contract,\u201d but it is not required.  Contractors commonly have esti mate  \nacceptance language at the bottom of their estimate  proposals, regardless the homeowner\u2019s \nsignature is required as it binds the agreement (contract).  The applicant and contractor must \nsign the contract(s) or estimate /proposal no later than the pre -construction conference.  If there \nare multiple contracts or estimate s and when utilizing the Borrower Method, Form RD 1924- 1, \n\u201cDevelopment Plan \u201d with cost estimates and estimate  specifications must be used.  Separate \ncontracts and arrangements which split responsibility of contractors (multiple small simultaneous contracts), should be avoided whenever it is practical to do so. \n \n12.13  COMMENCEMENT  OF WORK  \nOnce the contract or estimate  has been accepted and/or signed, the pre -construction \nconference has been held, the work may begin.  Generally, the complexity of most repairs and \nminor  rehabilitation  will not require  periodic  inspections  by Agency  staff. The homeowner  and \ncontractor should communicate with Agency staff any unforeseen issues that arise which could increase costs or jeopardize timely completion.  \n \n \n12-13 \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL PN  \nRevised  (05-05-25) PN  640",

Agency \ninspections, (including acceptable alternatives)  are completed  to ensure  the funds  were used for the \napproved purpose and do  not imply  duty or obligation to the homeowner.  The inspection(s) may \nbe conducted on -site by Agency staff utilizing Form RD 1924- 12, \u201c Inspection Report \u201d, or by \nalternative methods provided by the contractor or homeowner such as photos/videos showing the \ncompleted  work.  Alternative  methods  of inspection should be accompanied  by a written  report  as \nneeded to document items such as the appropriate posters being on display, percent of work completed,  etc.\n Written  reports  without  photos  provided to the Loan  Originator  should be used as \nlast resource and must be confirmed by the homeowner.  \nQualified third -party inspectors may be used when on- site inspections or alternative \nmethods are not feasible.  The cost for these services may also be reimbursed to the \nhomeowner  with loan or grant  funds.  Because of additional  costs  to the homeowner, payment \nfor qualified third- party inspectors is not the preferred method.  If inspections are conducted \nby a third party, the inspector should submit periodic inspection reports to the Agency.  \n \nB. Payment  Upon  Completion \nPayment  Options  \nBefore  the Loan  Originator  initiates  payment(s), the homeowner\u2019s  authorization must  be \ndocumented on Form RD 1924- 9, \u201cCertificate of Contractors Release. \u201d The number and timing  \nof inspections varies by the type and extent of work performed.  \n \nOnce work has commenced, there are two payment options.

This \nmethod increases  Agency  risk and provides  the least amount  of coverage to the borrower.  If this \nmethod is utilized, the total development of rehabilitation and repairs cannot exceed $5,000.  A \ndetailed estimate of labor and materials should be obtained in writing, with the exception for \namounts less than $100.  The Agency has two payment options:  \n\u2022 Checks  can be made payable  directly  to the laborer(s)  and/or  supplier(s)  to purchase \nlabor, equipment and materials, or  \n\u2022 Checks can be issued to the owner, if the owner has paid for labor/material out of \npocket, provides receipts/invoices to document the amount paid, and has obtained signatures  of the workers  who performed  labor  on Form  RD 1924- 11, \u201cStatement  of \nLabor Performed\u201d.  \n \n______________________________________________________________________________  \n12-15 \n \n(01-23-03) SPECIAL PN  \nRevised  (05-05-25) PN  640",

The homeowner  is party  to the \ncontract and therefore responsible to countersign the check and release it to the contractor as \npayment. Before payment occurs, the Loan Originator ensures that the work has been accepted \nby the homeowner.  If construction or rehabilitation work cannot be completed because the \ncontractor is unable or unwilling to do so, and a new contractor is not identified by the homeowner  within  30 days, loan funds  will be applied  to reduce the borrower\u2019s  principal  balance. \nGrant funds will be returned to the  Servicing and Asset Management Office (Servicing Office).  \nThe homeowner  must  be notified  of this action  in writing.  \nIf the homeowner  refuses  to pay the contractor  due to a dispute  or unsatisfactory \nworkmanship, the undisbursed funds will be processed in the following manner:  \n\u2022 If litigation  is pending,  the Agency  will consult  with the Office  of the General \nCounsel prior to disbursing or returning funds.  \n \n\u2022 If litigation is not pending, the Agency will return remaining funds to be applied to the borrower\u2019s loan or grant amount.\n Once funds have been disbursed or returned (and \ndeobligated, as applicable) , loans must be converted to permanent accounts on the first \nof the following month.

For construction loans, \nreturn ed funds must  be de- obligated prior to loan \nconversion.

When ordering multiple \ndraws  for loan-grant  combinations, additional  draws  on the grant  portion cannot  be performed  once \nthe loan has been fully disbursed.  \nLoan funds will typically be disbursed before grant funds; however, this may not always be \nfeasible as grant funds are disbursed to remove safety and health hazards or make the dwelling accessible for household members  with a disability.\n Funds  remaining  after completion  of work  should \nalways be returned to reduce the grant balance first when feasible.  \nIn some  instances,  a supervised bank account  may be necessary  for multiple  disbursements.  \nPlease refer to RD Instruction  1902- A for Supervised Bank  Accounts  (SBA) requirements.
