{"Building Resiliency for Islands in the Storm": "The U.S. Virgin Islands (USVI) is no stranger to hurricanes and tropical storms. But In 2017, the islands were hit by two major hurricanes that landed within weeks of each other. In the recovery efforts that followed, a couple of key items became clear: the need to improve island resiliency, and to ensure the continuity of vital services like electric service and access to medical care.",
"USDA RD partnered with the USVI Economic Development Authority (USVIEDA)": "to support a business incubator on St. Croix. Operating from an industrial park, the incubator housed five small, developing businesses that together have more than 50 employees. To help support the economic stability of these rural small businesses, USDA RD provided a $50,000 Rural Business Development Grant, and funds were used to purchase and install a generator at the industrial park. This project helped ensure St. Croix has one more power safety net in place when the next storm hits.",
"Continuity of medical care": "is another component of disaster preparation, whether for a global pandemic or weather-related incident. Telemedicine allows for remote care that keeps services in place regardless of physical obstacles. In 2019, USVI's Plessen Healthcare implemented a telehealth program at its Orange Grove medical center, allowing patients on the island to get specialized medical care from doctors across the globe.",
"The technology and equipment that helped make telemedicine possible for Plessen Healthcare": "was supported by USDA RD's Distance Learning and Telemedicine (DLT) Grant program. The DLT grant program helps rural communities use the unique capabilities of telecommunications to connect to each other and the world, overcoming the effects of remoteness and low population density.",
"Partnerships Key to Louisiana Disaster Recovery Assistance": "The Louisiana Watershed Initiative (information available at this link: watershed.la.gov/) was launched in 2018, creating eight watershed regions across the state, each with a governance structure to support Louisiana's long-term resilience from flooding risks. Planning was underway in the various regions to develop approaches to lessen flood risk, improve capacities, and maximize natural functions when another series of disasters impacted the state. The 2020 hurricane season and subsequent winter storms in early 2021 put a significant dent on Louisiana's vital watersheds, as well as other infrastructure systems.",
"As part of FEMA-led recovery efforts": "USDA RD coordinated with the Department of the Interior (DOI) to develop a two-day speaker series specific to Watershed 2, located in a rural portion of the state. The series included information on available programming and technical assistance resources that will serve as a foundation to help guide Watershed 2's priorities and decisions in recovery. Along with state and local groups, four federal agencies participated in the event.",
"Robust partnerships also helped address other infrastructure needs that followed the disasters.": "For instance, in response to Hurricane Laura in August 2020, USDA RD coordinated with FEMA's Public Assistance staff to identify projects that need funding for equipment, rehabilitation, or new construction. As a result of this partnership, water, wastewater treatment, and community facilities projects came to the attention of Louisiana Rural Development's Community Programs staff for preliminary eligibility reviews regarding scope and entity eligibility.",
