Use of this specification should help eliminate ambiguities that might arise \nin the evaluation process of competitively bid standard class steel poles procurements. \nBorrowers or their engineering representatives will need to complete this specification \nand add documents as appropriate.  Modifications to this specification may be necessary \nto consider special applications or preferences of the owner. \n2. \nSCOPE  \nThis suggested purchase specification covers the technical aspects of design, materials, \nmanufacturing, inspection, testing, and delivery of direct embedded standard class steel \npoles.  It is recommended that this specification be limited to single poles that are not \nguyed, not subjected to unbalanced lateral loads, or do not have unusual deflection or \nother special limitations.  For applications that consider these items, it is recommended \nthat the owner use \u201cGuide Specifications for Steel Single Pole and H-Frame Structures,\u201d \nRUS Bulletin 1724E-204.   \nThis guide specification does not include contract (front-end) documents or specifications \nfor construction.  The user of this specification should add these documents, including \ngeneral conditions and any supplemental instructions to the bidders.  This specification \nmay be expanded to include H-frame structures. \n3. \nINITIAL DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS \nThere are engineering decisions required of the user of this specification to determine \nwhich standard class steel poles to specify.  Some examples include, but are not limited to: \n\u2022 Amount of foundation rotation in contributing to P-delta moments; \n\u2022 Location of point of fixity; \n\u2022 Embedment depths; \n\u2022 Load cases to be considered in addition to those required by the National \nElectrical Safety Code (NESC); and \n\u2022 Deflection limitations. \nPrior to the selection of a standard class pole, the user should perform the engineering \nrequired for these types of issues or employ an engineering consultant to do so.  See \nAppendix A of this bulletin for a discussion of some of these items."

The specification should contain sufficient requirements and information so that all \nbids can be evaluated equally and so that the manufacturer clearly understands what is \nexpected of the manufacturer. \nScope \nWhile use of this standard class steel pole specification is not prohibited to poles which are \nguyed, which are subjected to unbalanced lateral loads or which have deflection or other \nspecial limitations, the owner must be prudent when using this specification in these types \nof applications. \nIt is recognized that, with the proper understanding and usage of some computerized \nstructural analysis and transmission line design programs, it is possible to select a standard \nclass steel pole which might otherwise be beyond the scope of this specification.  The \nowner must be sure that combined bending and buckling analysis is performed, and that \ndeflections are properly modeled.  \nThe owner should recognize when the design of a steel pole may be more prudently \naccomplished using the \u201cGuide Specification for Steel Single Pole and H-Frame \nStructures,\u201d RUS Bulletin 1724E-204, which requires the actual loading conditions to be \nspecified.  In using RUS Bulletin 1724E-204, the manufacturer assumes full responsibility \nin designing and manufacturing a structurally adequate pole.  \nStandard Class Pole \nIn some cases, utilities prefer to specify certain steel poles to be designed according to \nstandardized loading criteria, much like the standard classifications for wood poles. \nIn utilizing standard class steel poles, a complete structural analysis is still required for all \nstructures.  All appropriate loading criteria are considered in the analysis.  Once the \nrequired steel pole strength is determined, a standard class steel pole that meets the actual \nloading conditions can be selected.  A complete design example is shown in Appendix C. \nWithout considering all the potential reasons for specifying standard class poles, this \nspecification is developed in order to establish a standard classification system and to assist \nthe owner in procuring a standard class steel pole which is properly designed for the \nintended loading criteria."

Since it has become a widespread practice in the industry to \ndesign and manufacture poles which are based on the wood pole classification system of \nthe American National Standards Institute (ANSI 05.1), the steel pole classifications \ndeveloped in this specification generally follow the wood pole classification system. \nHowever, to avoid confusion with the wood pole classifications, the steel pole \nclassifications have a unique naming system. \nWood Pole Equivalency \nIn some cases, the owner may design a transmission line based on wood pole \nclassifications as described in ANSI 05.1 and then wish to order steel poles which meet the \nwood pole equivalent loadings.  Because of the differences in strength factors applied to \nwood poles in comparison to steel poles, the owner must be sure that the strength factors \nare properly accounted for in the design of the steel poles.  \n\u201cWood pole equivalent\u201d is a term that may be defined in a number of ways.  For purposes \nof this commentary, the term \u201cwood pole equivalent\u201d is defined as a standard class steel \npole which is equated by required factored loading to an ANSI 05.1 standard class wood \npole.  The equation is made by a ratio of the strength factors applicable for each pole type \nand loading criteria. \nThe design and purchase of steel poles as an equivalent to wood poles can be vague even \nwith clear instructions.  As such, the owner should be sure that the equivalency is properly \ndetermined. Once the equivalency is determined, the owner should specify the standard \nclass steel pole based on the classifications detailed in paragraph 5.a.(2).  In doing this, the \nmanufacturer will not be involved in the equivalency process and the ambiguity should be \neliminated. \nThe wood pole equivalency is based on the required ultimate moment capacity of the pole \nat the groundline based on embedment depths shown in ANSI 05.1.  In obtaining a suitable \nequivalency, the owner must consider factors other than the equivalent groundline \nmoment.  For example, the differences in material and section properties of the wood pole \nversus the steel pole will result in differences in buckling analysis, pole deflections, \nsecondary moments, applied wind forces, etc. \nIt is impossible to completely equate the steel pole and wood pole at all points along the \npole.  The owner must be certain that the steel pole selected by equivalency methods will \nhave strength sufficient for the actual application."

Thus, the equivalency factor will be 0.65/1.00 = \n0.650. \nThe equivalency factor is a useful concept to understand as the owner requires a wood pole \nequivalent under various loading conditions and strength factors.  Several examples of \nequivalencies are listed in the following sections. \nWood Pole Equivalency \u2013 0.65 TO 1.00 Ratio (0.65 Eq.F) \nFor the NESC Grade B district loadings, the NESC allows for a strength factor of 1.00 to \nbe applied to a load on a steel pole while it requires a strength factor of 0.65 to be applied \nto a load on a wood pole.  As such, the ultimate strength requirement for the steel pole will \nbe less than the ultimate strength of the wood pole for the district loading conditions. \nFor example, the owner designs a transmission line for wood poles based on NESC district \nwind loading conditions.  The owner wishes to purchase a steel pole that is equivalent to a \nClass 1 wood pole.  Based on ANSI 05.1, the Class 1 wood pole groundline strength is \nderived by applying a horizontal factored load of 4,500 pounds at 2 feet from the pole top \nbased on a simple cantilever.  Since the owner had classed the wood pole based on an \nNESC strength factor of 0.65, the owner wishes to select a steel pole meeting the same \nNESC district wind loading conditions.  To do this, the owner will multiply the required tip \nloading of 4,500 pounds by 0.65/1.00, which equals 2,925 pounds.  The 0.65/1.00 ratio (or \n0.65 Eq.F) adjusts for the difference between wood and steel strength factors.  The owner \nwill then select a standard class steel pole which has an ultimate moment capacity based on \nthe horizontal tip loading of at least 2,925 pounds.  From paragraph 5.a.(2), the owner \nselects a class S-02.9 pole, which has a tip loading of 2,925 pounds. \nBased on the method shown in this example, Table A-1 of this Appendix at the end of this \nsection is a tabulation of wood pole equivalencies based on the NESC Grade B district \nloading. \nWood Pole Equivalency - 0.75 to 1.00 Ratio (0.75 Eq.F) \nFor the NESC Grade B extreme wind loadings, this specification requires a strength factor \nof 1.00 to be applied to an extreme wind load on a steel pole while the NESC requires a \nstrength factor of 0.75 to be applied to an extreme wind load on a wood pole.  As such, the \nultimate strength requirement for the steel pole will be less than the ultimate strength of the \nwood pole for the NESC extreme wind loading conditions."

One common application of this is when the owner designs a transmission \nline using wood pole properties but utilizing steel pole strength factors.  In this case, the \nowner has accounted for the difference in wood versus steel strength factors during the \ndesign of the project. \nFor example, the owner designs a transmission line for wood poles based on NESC district \nwind loading conditions.  However, for steel poles, the owner uses the NESC district \nstrength factor of 1.00 (applicable to steel poles) in the calculations.  The owner selects a \nwood pole Class 1 at a specific location.  Thus, the owner wishes to purchase a steel pole \nwhich is equivalent in ultimate strength to a Class 1 wood pole.

Consideration should be given for strength \nrequirements at all points along the pole, not just at the groundline. \nP-Delta Moment \nPrior to selecting a standard class steel pole, the owner should determine the effect of the \nsecondary moments due to the vertical loadings, including the effect of the pole weight, \nduring the transmission line design process. \nWhenever there is a transverse or longitudinal load, the pole will deflect in the direction of \nthe load.  As a result, the vertical load is no longer in its original position.  The vertical \nload moves over as the pole deflects, causing additional moments in the pole.  Also, the \npole weight can place secondary moment loads in the pole.  The additional stress caused \nby this secondary moment is dependent on the magnitude of the vertical load and deflected \nshape of the pole.  Many pole designs, particularly tall poles, have to be calculated for the \nposition of equilibrium of forces in the fully displaced position.  The solution typically \ntakes many iterations.  A full nonlinear analysis will consider the change in orientation of \nthe loads relative to the displaced positions of the structural members.  \nAs a minimum, an approximate method for determining the effect of the secondary \nmoments should be utilized, such as the method given in the RUS Bulletin 1724E-200. \nFoundation Rotation and Deflection \nAlthough significant foundation rotation and deflection criteria are considered to be \nbeyond the scope of this standard class steel pole specification, some allowances can be \nmade for these effects.  They should be considered during the owner\u2019s analysis of the \nactual loading conditions to apply to the steel pole.  Typically, this type of analysis is \naccomplished by nonlinear structural analysis techniques.  \nOnce the structural analysis has been completed (including foundation rotations and \ndeflections, p-delta effect, etc.), the owner may select a standard class steel pole that has \nthe ultimate moment capacity greater than the design loading requirements. \nLongitudinal Loads \nIt is recommended that RUS Bulletin 1724E-204 be utilized whenever the longitudinal \nloads may result in a significant unbalanced lateral loading condition."

Traditionally, static longitudinal loads are specified due to the complexity \nof calculating the influence of structure flexibility. \nGuyed Poles and Guy Wires \nIt is generally beyond the scope of this standard class steel pole specification to consider \nguyed poles and guy wires in the design of the structure.  It is recommended that RUS \nBulletin 1724E-204 be utilized instead. \nIt is generally agreed that a steel pole has less buckling strength than an equivalently \nclassed wood pole.  Wood poles are solid wood and the material in the heart of the pole \ncan resist buckling.  Standard class steel poles however, are thin walled, hollow structures \nwith limited buckling strength.  The forces resulting from the attachment of the guy wires \nto the standard class steel pole needs to be carefully analyzed by a structural engineer.  The \nsteel pole and guy wire(s) must be designed as a system.  \nAny time a steel pole structure is guyed, the guy type, size, modulus of elasticity and guy \nslope or angle has to be determined by the owner and properly modeled in the analysis of \nthe steel structure.  The load in the guy wire should be limited to 65 percent of its ASTM \nrated breaking strength under actual factored loading conditions, as is required by RUS \nBulletin 1724E-204.  The steel pole and guy wire(s) must be designed as a system.  The \nguy modulus of elasticity can increase from a minimum value at the time of manufacture, \nto a maximum value that results from periodic stretching and relaxing during the load \ncycles.  Ranges from 19,000 ksi to 28,000 ksi have been stated.  The ASCE steel pole \nspecification (ASCE 48) has suggested the engineer use a guy wire modulus of elasticity of \n23,000 ksi whenever it is not specified. \nThe owner should use caution in using this equivalency method of sizing standard class \nsteel poles and its usage should be prudently influenced by the owner\u2019s experience in \nsimilar applications where actual design loadings were utilized under similar guying \nconditions.  However, a typical situation where the owner may wish to use this \nspecification for guyed poles is when the owner uses a transmission line design computer \nprogram, or other structural analysis program, in which minimum strength values are input \nfor each pole type and the program is capable of combined bending and buckling analysis \nof guyed steel poles. \nPoint of Fixity - Paragraph 5.a.(1) \nPoint of fixity for this specification is defined as the location on the pole where maximum \nmoment occurs.  Maximum moment is calculated by the pole designer using the loadings \nprovided by the owner and multiplying those loadings by the appropriate moment arms.  \nThe existing soil and backfill has to be able to support the pole with these bending \nmoments applied.  The location of this point of fixity could be at or below the groundline."

Within the scope of this standard class pole specification, the point of fixity is \narbitrarily considered to be located at a distance from the pole butt that is equal to 7 \npercent of the pole length.  This value seems to work quite well over a range of pole \nlengths and is approximately the same value as a point of fixity located at 1/3 of the \ndistance below the groundline based on an embedment depth of 10 percent of the pole \nlength + 2 feet.  \nPole Top Strength (Paragraph 5.a.(2)(a) \nThis specification sets minimum ultimate moment capacity requirements near the pole top \nfor each standard pole classification.  The similar ANSI 05.1 requirement is generally \noverlooked, misunderstood or not considered by manufacturers and others who seek to \nstandardize pole sizes based on the wood pole classifications.  \nUpon a careful study of the ANSI 05.1 wood pole specification, one should understand that \nthe horizontal loading applied at 2 feet from the pole top is for the purpose of determining \na required groundline ultimate moment capacity for any length pole of the given class.  \nHowever, the minimum required wood pole top size is specified apart from the horizontal \nloading requirement  \nFor example, according to ANSI 05.1, a Class 1 wood pole must have a circumference of \n27 inches at the top.  When applied to the Douglas Fir or Southern Yellow Pine poles with \na fiber stress of 8,000 psi, the resulting top strength is calculated as 41.5 ft-kips for the \nClass 1 wood pole.  \nBecause the conductors and shield wire supports are typically located on crossarms away \nfrom the pole axis, significant moments can be generated in the pole near the top.  The \nmoments are greatly increased whenever a braced pole top assembly is utilized.  These \nmoments are not accounted for by applying the horizontal factored loading alone.  \nTherefore, in the design of transmission poles, it is critical that a minimum ultimate \nmoment capacity be specified near the pole top.  In the absence of a minimum top strength \nrequirement, a steel pole top strength can theoretically be negligible. \nThe minimum pole top strength required by this specification should be suitable for most \ntransmission line applications.  However, the owner must be sure that the top strength is \nproperly evaluated, especially when working with wood pole equivalencies and braced \nstructures."

This \nultimate moment capacity is determined by multiplying the tip load by the moment arm \nbased on a simple cantilever.  As a result, the required factored moment diagram is linear \nin shape.  This same method may be utilized in structural analysis and automated \ntransmission line design computer programs to develop an array of factored moment \nrequirements for standard steel pole sizes. \nPole Deflection - Paragraph 5.a.(3) \nAlthough significant horizontal pole deflection limitations are considered to be beyond the \nscope of this standard class steel pole specification, some allowances can be made for these \neffects.  They should be considered during the analysis of the actual loading conditions \napplied to the steel pole. Typically, this type of analysis should be accomplished by \nnonlinear structural analysis techniques.  Since the electrical clearances must be assured in \nthe operation of transmission lines, deflections must remain within an acceptable range.  \nThis specification limits the allowable pole deflection to 15 percent of the pole height \nabove the point of fixity when the tip load specified in paragraph 5.a.(2) is applied under a \nhorizontal testing procedure. \nThe owner should recognize that the actual pole deflection for the application will be less \nthan the specified deflection limit of 15 percent of the pole height.  With the standard class \npole, all of the loading is applied near the pole top.  In a typical transmission line \napplication, the actual horizontal loading will be some distance from the pole top.  As \nsuch, the actual deflection at the conductor under short term factored loading conditions \ncan be expected to be less than 10 percent of the height above ground. \nThe NESC requires that electrical clearances be maintained under a wind loading of 6 psf.  \nIt is expected that the deflection of a standard class pole under this 6 psf loading condition \nwill be less than 3 percent of the height above ground. \nFor situations where the owner wishes to know the deflection for a standard class pole, the \nowner should use a suitable structural analysis computer program in which the actual \ndesign loading conditions and steel pole properties are input into the program, or the owner \nshould ask the pole manufacturer to provide the analysis.  \nIf the owner has special deflection limitations, it is recommended that RUS Bulletin \n1724E-204 be utilized instead of this specification.  In doing so, there will be little doubt as \nto what the actual pole deflections will be under all loading conditions."

Use of plate thickness less than \n3/16 inch may be possible.  However, consensus from the committee members and based \non current designs by the manufacturers, transmission size poles will normally require at \nleast a plate thickness of 3/16 inch.  If mild corrosion occurs, the percentage of reduced \nstrength will be less the greater the wall thickness of the steel plate.  Having the minimum \nplate thickness of 3/16 inch will also improve strength for mounting of davit arms and guy \nattachments.  If an owner does decide to purchase poles with a wall thickness less than \n3/16-inch, extra care should be taken in the field to avoid damage to the pole during \nstorage, handling, and installation.  Small nicks in the galvanizing or other protective \ncoating could exaggerate future problems.  Also, minor misalignments or poor fit of \nhardware during construction could cause a major problem.  Ground collars on thin wall \npoles should be considered a necessity.  Other sections of this commentary explain why \npoles purchased with this guide should not be used in guying situations, unless an engineer \nexperienced with guyed steel structures oversees the design.  This is especially true for \npoles of wall thickness less than 3/16 inch.   \nGround Collars - Paragraphs 5.a.(12) and 5.a.(13) \nAttachment B of the specification is set up to allow the owner to alter the requirement for a \nground collar by putting \u201cnot required\u201d on line 6.  Ground collars are recommended for \ndirect embedded weathering steel poles, but they are sometimes optional with galvanized \nsteel poles.  If ground collars are used, a length of 4 feet or greater is recommended. \nThe intent of ground collars on standard class steel poles is similar to the preservative of \nwood poles.  The preservative protects the wood against rot and fungus attack.  Similarly, \nthe ground collar protects the steel pole from corrosion and mechanical damage. \nThe ground collar does not prevent nicks.  The ground collar does provide nonstructural \nsteel that can be sacrificed to corrosion.  Corrosion can be due to many outside causes over \nwhich the owner has no control.  A short list of potential causes includes road salt, \nfertilizer, poor/corrosive soil, and galvanic corrosion from pipeline crossings or \nunderground electric lines.  The ground collar also protects the pole from mechanical \ndamage that may occur during construction or later by right-of-way crew or by property \nowners. \nWhereas some utilities feel that galvanized poles with polyurethane coating do not need \nadditional corrosion and mechanical protection, they do feel that weathering steel poles \nneed additional protection to the patina and polyurethane coating.  Some manufacturers \nclaim that poles that are galvanized and the embedded portion coated with polyurethane \ncoating (paragraph 5.i.(1)), do not require a ground collar.  If nicks do occur to a \ngalvanized pole, the galvanizing will act like a sacrificial anode and protect the nicked \nsteel."

      "content": "Bulletin 1724E-214 \nAppendix A \n Page 12 \n \nASCE 48 states that bare weathering steel should not be used below grade due to the \npotential problems from corrosion.  Some utilities add a round collar to all weathering steel \npoles.  Still other utilities in dry climates with non-corrosive soils may not use ground \ncollars.  However, since the polyurethane coating can be nicked during construction, it is \nrecommended that round collars be used on all weathering steel poles. \nCharpy Requirements - Paragraph 5.b.(3) \nCharpy test is a notch-bar impact test used to compare notch sensitivities of materials.  The \nimpact values cannot be converted into energy figures for use directly in engineering \ndesign.  The impact value from the notch-bar impact test is used only as a comparison test.  \nFor example, if a type of steel has been found to have good notch toughness in service and \nits impact value is known, it is assumed that other types of steel having the same impact \nvalue will also have the same notch toughness.  The ASCE design standard for steel poles \nhas established impact values for the Charpy notch-bar impact test.  These values are a \nfunction of yield stress, plate or bar thickness, and temperature. \nNotch-bar impact tests are used to help determine if a normally ductile material might \nbehave in a brittle manner.  Three main factors that influence if a material will behave in a \nbrittle or ductile manner are triaxiality, strain rate, and temperature.  Ductile materials tend \nto become more brittle as triaxiality increases, strain rate increases, or temperature \ndecreases.  Since brittle materials require far less energy for fracture than ductile materials \nof the same strength, one can realize the importance of the Charpy test for steel poles used \non transmission lines. \nThe tendency is to reduce temperature requirements of the Charpy test for structures to be \nin service in warm climates such as Louisiana or Florida.  This is not recommended.  \nHowever, for locations in which temperatures may be extremely low, lower temperature \nvalues may need to be specified. \nThe ASCE design standard specification contains Charpy requirements for structural plate, \nanchor bolts, and weld materials.  The material used for making welds is required to meet \nthe impact requirements for the lowest toughness requirements of the plates being joined.  \nField Drilled Holes - Paragraph 5.c.(16) \nDrilling holes in a pole during construction allows the maximum flexibility in the use of \npoles in unexpected situations.  However, the cutting of the pole does affect the corrosion \nprotection of the pole.  For galvanized poles and painted galvanized poles, a drilled hole \nexposes bare steel to the weather.  These holes need to be painted with a zinc rich touch up \npaint similar to described in paragraph 5.i.(1)(a).  For poles made from weathering steel \nthe hole can allow rain or ground water into the pole depending on the hole location.  \nWeathering steel poles protect themselves from corrosion by constantly cycling from wet \nto dry.  This cycling creates a water tight oxide layer.  Inside the pole or under water the \ncycling cannot happen.  Therefore, there is no corrosion"

When field drilled holes are anticipated, the inside of weathering steel \npole should be coated similar to the coating described in paragraph 5.i.(1)(d).  If coating \nthe inside is not practical then a thick coating of a silicon sealant shall be applied to the \nbolt and hole.  Field drilling of painted poles should be avoided if possible.  Drilling \nholes in painted poles destroys the water tightness and allows corrosion to start on the \nunprotected carbon steel. If holes cannot be avoided then a thick coating of a silicon \nsealant shall be applied to the bolt and hole.  \nField Drilled Holes (wrong location/drilled in error) \nOccasionally a field-drilled hole will end up in the wrong location.  A rule of thumb from \nThe American Welding Society (AWS) says a defect or hole location is critical if another \nhole is spaced within 2.5 times the diameter of the hole in question. (i.e. two 1 inch holes \nshould not be closer than 2 \u00bd inch edge to edge).  A structural analysis of the actual \nconditions will possibly give a different answer.  If the location is critical then a field weld \nrepair is needed by a certified welder. \nIf the location is not critical then it can be filled with an automotive type freeze plug and \npainted with touch up paint.  The hole should be plugged to keep birds and insects out of \nthe pole and to slow or prevent corrosion to the inside of the pole.  The above rule of \nthumb does not apply to holes that are drilled at the correct elevation but on the wrong \nface.  These poles need to be reviewed by the manufacturer and repaired by a certified \nwelder or these poles need to be replaced. \nPole Materials  (Galvanized Steel vs. Weathering Steel) \nStructural grade steel is a great product for many reasons. However it has one definite \nproblem. Mother Nature wants to return it to its natural state of iron ore.  Industry has used \nmany ways to slow the corrosion process.  In 1836 a chemist patented a means for coating \niron with zinc.  That process of hot dip galvanizing remains substantially unchanged today.  \nIn the 1900's another method was found.  By having a relatively high copper content in the \nraw steel a dense patina oxide coating would form on the steel and act as a tight adhered \nbarrier preventing future atmospheric corrosion.  This steel was largely forgotten until the \n1960's when US Steel started marketing their version of this steel as \"COR-TEN\".  Today \nit is commonly called weathering steel. \nThe formation of dense patina oxide on weathering steel requires a cycling from wet to dry \nenvironment - optimally 50 percent wet and 50 percent dry.  Departure from the 50/50 ratio \nwill slow the oxide formation.  Unfortunately, this limitation was not well understood in \nthe 1960's and weathering steel was used in locations where water and dirt were trapped.  \nThe result was the oxide did not form and the corrosion continued as if the steel was \nnormal bare steel.  In some cases such as highway bridges and lattice towers the corrosion \ncaused a problem that was given the name \"pack-out\".  In this case the corrosion takes \nplace between two pieces of steel that are bolted together in such a configuration that water \nis trapped and held.  The corrosion products swell."

As a result of this problem weathering steel developed a bad \nreputation.  However, with prudent attention to details, weathering steel is being used by \nmany utilities today. \nBoth galvanized steel and weathering steel have their advantages.  Which is better is a \nquestion that has not been answered.  Weathering steel normally has a cost advantage and \ncan be factory welded to make a one-piece pole of any length.  The one-piece length of \ngalvanized poles is limited to the length of the galvanizing tank.  Weathering steel \nbecomes a dark brown wood color.  A galvanized pole starts out shiny and ends up a dull \ngray.  Some people say that weathering steel should not be used in areas of heavy road salt \nor in heavily fertilized farm fields.  The weathering steel manufacturers found a number of \npoles in undesirable conditions, tested them and found that the oxide had formed and that \ncorrosion was not a problem.  This guide makes no judgment as to which material is better \nor gives any guidance in the use of one versus the other.  If correctly used both will \nperform very well.  If not used as intended, neither will perform as desired.  It is \nrecommended that the owner contact the pole supplier to select the best material for the \npole's intended application.   \nPainted Poles  \nPainted bare steel poles are not recommended.  These poles have more construction and \nmaintenance expenses than poles with paint over zinc primer or paint over hot dip \ngalvanizing.  The inside surface of bare steel poles is not protected and the poles can \ncorrode from the inside out.  Also the outside paint is easily chipped leaving bare steel \nwhich may quickly corrode.  \nWeathering Steel Poles - Paragraphs 5.i.(1)(c) and 5.i.(1)(d) \nThere are environments where weathering steel is not recommended in a bare, uncoated \ncondition because the protective, tight oxide will not form properly.  These environments \ninclude:  (1) atmospheres containing concentrated corrosive industrial fumes, (2) marine \nlocations subject to salt-water spray or salt-laden fogs, or (3) applications where the steel \nmay be continuously submerged in water (salt or fresh) or buried (bare) in soil.  Use of \nweathering steel poles near roads that are salted during the winter should be avoided. \nIn general, weathering steel is intended for and is most often used in a bare, uncoated \ncondition.  However, those surfaces that will not be exposed to the weather or subjected to \na wet-dry cycle should be protected from corrosion.  Flat, horizontal surfaces are \nparticularly vulnerable.  Also, in areas where ground cover will grow to a height where it \nwill contact the pole and rub the protective weathering steel coat off or in areas where the \nvegetation will keep the pole moist, the steel surface should be protected from corrosion by \napplication of a coating.  For direct embedded steel poles, the polyurethane coating may \nhave to be extended above the top of the ground sleeve to protect the weathering steel pole \nfrom moisture entrapped by vegetation or rubbing by groundcover."

      "content": "Bulletin 1724E-214 \nAppendix A \nPage 15 \n \n \nDirect Embedded Poles - Coating General - Paragraph 5.i.(1)(d) \nWhen poles are direct embedded, this specification requires a polyurethane coating to be \napplied to the exterior surface of the embedded portion of the pole.  The top edge of the \ncoating is not a smooth transition.  Water and dirt can get trapped in this area.  Therefore, \nwe suggest that the transition be located about 2 inches below the top of the ground collar \nwhere there is extra metal.  Some poles get set in areas of high vegetation.  These poles \nmay require the coating to extend higher on the pole. A full discussion of this is given \nbelow.  \nBearing Plate, Coatings, Construction in Wet Areas - Paragraph 5.i.(1)(d) \nThere are many problems associated with setting poles in wet areas and or bad soils.  Two \nof these problems are floating poles and bog or swamp shoes.  The floating poles can be \ndue to the fact that some poles are designed without drain holes in the bearing plate.  When \nsoil conditions require the use of driller\u2019s mud during the augering process, the pole may \nfloat and it is impossible to set it in the foundation unless the water is removed from the \nhole, which may cause the sides of the hole to collapse.  The pole could be set if there was \na hole in the bearing plate to allow the fluid into the pole.  Galvanized poles are allowed to \nhave a drain hole in the bearing plate to facilitate the galvanizing process (paragraph \n5.a.(10)). Weathering steel poles are not normally allowed to have this same hole due to \nabsence of corrosion protection inside the pole. Weathering steel poles should not be used \nin areas where water/water table is above the base/bearing plate of a steel pole.   The owner \nmay want to coat the inside of galvanized poles with a coating similar to that on the outside \nof the pole and described in paragraph 5.i.(1)(d).  \nThe problem of swamp or bog shoe is the method of attaching the device to the pole.  \nNormally this is done by drilling a hole through the pole and using a through bolt.  The \nproblem is these bolts may be at or below water line. Therefore they let water into the pole.  \nThis does not cause a major problem for galvanized poles.  For weathering steel the steel \nneeds to cycle from wet to dry to create the corrosion protection.  This cannot happen \nunder the above conditions.  There are two solutions.  One is to have the inside of the pole \ncoated as described above, the other is to have the manufacture install a water tight sleeved \nhole at the location of the attachment bolts.  \nStructure Testing - Paragraph 5.L \nAn option is available in the specification for full scale testing of poles.  For a \nmanufacturer that has been designing and fabricating steel poles with the same processes \nfor a good number of years, the need for testing of a steel pole is questionable.  Pole testing \nmay be appropriate in cases where there are unusual requirements, new fabrication \ntechniques or, when new suppliers are used to validate their design."

The large amount of copper used in a substation grounding \ngrid may create a galvanic corrosion cell, with the steel of the pole sacrificing itself.  \nAnodes or extra subsurface protection may be needed. \nAdditional Protection \nThe owner or owner's representative should determine if anodes should protect the \nembedded poles.  If it is necessary, requirements for sacrificial anodes and their installation \nshould be incorporated in the construction specification. \nElectrical Grounding and Polyurethane Coating  \nWhen poles are direct embedded, this specification requires a polyurethane coating to be \napplied to the exterior surface of the embedded portion of the pole.  This coating will tend \nto insulate the pole from the ground and as such, supplemental grounding may be \nnecessary.  \nGround Rods \nUse of copper or copper clad ground wire and rods should be avoided with direct \nembedded poles.  Galvanized rods and couplings are suggested.   \n4.   \nSHIPPING - Paragraph 6.a.(3) \nLumber treated with salts (Ammoniacal copper arsenate, ACA, Ammoniacal copper zinc \narsenate, ACZA, and Chromated copper arsenate, CCA) to retard \u201cdecay or fire\u201d will \nchemically attack the steel.  Urethane foam or some foam containing fire retardants \nshould not be used in packaging and shipping.  When these materials become wet, they \nbecome very corrosive. \n5.   \nDRAWINGS AND INFORMATION TO BE SUPPLIED BY THE \nMANUFACTURER - Section 7 \nIn order to properly evaluate bids, the specification requires certain information to be \nsupplied with the bid.
