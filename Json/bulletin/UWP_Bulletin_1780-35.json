This exemption only applies to coatings on the external surface of iron and steel components. It does not apply to coatings or linings on intemal surfaces of iron and steel products, such as the lining of lined pipes.

Any coating processes that are applied to the extemal surface of iron and steel components that would otherwise be AIS compliant would not disqualify the product from meeting the AIS requirements regardless of where the coating processes occur, provided that final assembly of the product occurs in the United States. This exemption only applies to coatings on the external surface of iron and steel components. It does not apply to coatings or linings on intemal surfaces of iron and steel products, such as the lining of lined pipes. All manufacturing processes for lined pipes, including the application of pipe lining, must occur in the United States for the product to be compliant with AIS requirements.",
    "Construction materials are": "those articles, materials, or supplies made primarily of iron and steel, that are permanently incorporated into the project, not including mechanical and/or electrical components, equipment and systems. Some of these products may overlap with what is also considered structural steel.",
