    "1. SUMMARY": "The Uniform System of Accounts (USoA) promulgated by the Federal Energy Regulatory\nCommission (FERC) codified in 18 CFR 101, serves as a basis for the Rural Utilities Service\n(RUS or the Agency) USoA codified in 7 CFR 1767, Accounting Requirements for RUS Electric\nBorrowers. When new or revised accounting guidance is provided by FERC for electric utilities,\nthe Agency must review this guidance within the framework of this part for applicability to its\nborrowers. FERC issued Order 898, Accounting and Reporting of Certain Renewable Energy\nAssets, on June 29, 2023, published at 88 FR 69314, which identified new accounts in the USOA,\nto be effective January 1, 2025. The intent of FERC Order 898 was to create new accounts for\nwind, solar, and other renewable generating assets; create a new functional class for energy\nstorage accounts; codify the accounting treatment of environmental credits; and create new\naccounts within existing functions for computer hardware, software, and communication\nequipment. In addition to the new accounts, FERC Order 898 provides revisions to specific\nsections of General Instructions and Electric Plant Instructions and corresponding changes to\nFERC Forms to implement these changes.",
    "After reviewing Order 898, RUS, an agency of Rural Development, recommends Electric": "Awardees adopt the 160 new accounts identified below into the Uniform System of Accounts.\nFurther, RUS is providing recommended general instructions specific to accounting for\nenvironmental credits. RUS expects to revise its regulations with respect to these accounts\nshortly; however, until such time, it recommends that entities follow these recommendations.",

The cost of eligible environmental credits not used in the current year should be transferred to the vintage for the immediately following year.",
    "5": "Account 158.3 Bundled Environmental Credits Inventory and Account 158.4 Unbundled Environmental Credits Inventory should be credited and Account 555.2 Bundled Environmental Credits, and Account 555.3 Unbundled Environmental Credits, debited respectively, so the cost of the environmental credits to be remitted for the year is charged to expense based on each month's usage. This may, in certain circumstances, require allocation of the cost of an allowance between months on a fractional basis.",
    "6": "In any period in which a utility records its estimated amount of required environmental credits, the utility should charge Account 158.3 or Account 158.4 with the estimated cost as appropriate. This estimated cost of future allowance acquisitions shall be credited to Account 158.3 or Account 158.4 and debited to Account 555.2 or Account 555.3, in the same accounting period as appropriate. Should the actual cost of these environmental credits differ from the estimated cost, the differences should be recognized in the then-current period's inventory issuance cost through Account 158.3, and Account 158.4, as well as Account 555.2, and Account 555.3 within a single month, as appropriate.",

First, if there is uncertainty as to the regulatory treatment, the gain should be deferred in Account 254, Other Regulatory Liabilities, pending resolution of the uncertainty. Second, if there is certainty as to the existence of a regulatory liability, the gain will be credited to Account 254, with subsequent recognition in income when reductions in charges to customers occur or the liability is otherwise satisfied. Third, all other gains will be credited to Account 411.11, Gain from Disposition of Environmental Credits. Losses on disposition of environmental credits, other than those held for speculative purposes, should be accounted for as follows. Losses that qualify as regulatory assets should be charged directly to Account 182.3, Other Regulatory Assets. All other losses should be charged to Account 411.12, Losses from Disposition of Environmental Credits. (See the definition of regulatory assets and liabilities.) Gains or losses on disposition of environmental credits held for speculative purposes should be recognized in Account 421, Miscellaneous Nonoperating Income, or Account 426.5, Other Deductions, as appropriate.",
