    "Revisions_Note": "The following revisions have resulted from the necessity to accommodate the attached samole documents covered in REA Bulletin 415-1, Sale of Property Ly Talapnore Forrowers for specific inclusion of the Rural Telephone Bank. The attached instruction Number (8) will be added to Page 2 of the Instructions for Attorney Preparing a Release of Lien contained in REA Bulletin 415-1, Sale of Property by Telephone Borrowers. The attached Exhibits A, B, C, and D will replace the existing Exhibits A, B, C, and D now attached to Bulletin 415-1.",
    "Policies_Note": "The policies and instructions specified in REA Bulletin 415-1 will apply to both REA and RTB borrowers. All mention of REA and the Government in the Bulletin, except as specifically provided in the attached docu- ments and instruction shall be deemed to cover the Rural Telephone Bank except in the case of Paragraph IV, A 2 and 3.",
    "Special_Attention": "Special attention is directed to REA Bulletin 320-12, Notes, Interest Computation, Payments and Loan Account Statements. Special payment on RTB loans and loans guaranteed by REA for the Federal Financing Bank (REA holds the lien on these loans) ordinarily would not be the most advantageous course for the borrower as there are usually prepayment penalties attached to FFB and RTB loans as explained in the bulletin.",

    "Revised Procedure": "Under the revised procedure, borrowers are responsible for preparing and furnishing the partial releases to be executed by REA. The partial release should be prepared by the borrower's attorney or by the attorney for the purchaser of the property. It will be the responsibility of such attorney and the borrower to assure the accuracy and legal effectiveness of a proposed release.",
    "Effect of Change": "The effect of this change is to require that all requests to REA for partial release of lien include the release to be executed. Where a sale of property requires REA approval in accordance with REA Bulletin 115-1 (Electric): 415-1 (Telephone) and a release of lien is necessary, the release of lien in appropriate form should accompany REA Form 369, Request for Approval to Sell Property (Electric), or REA Form 793, Request for Release of Lien and/or Approval of Sale (Telephone).",
    "Assistance": "To assist the borrower's or purchaser's attorney in preparing the required release so that it will serve its intended purpose and be satisfactory for execution by REA, instructions and recommended forms are attached.",

    "matter_2": "All mortgages, deeds of trust, and supplements thereto securing REA loans should be listed in the form. It is important that underlying security instruments be included, as well as current security instruments, since all REA mortgages and deeds of trust contain after-acquired property clauses and thus cover all property of the borrower theretofore and thereafter acquired. Security documents have generally been filed for record in all counties in which property of the borrower is located; the underlying security instruments are generally described in the \"Whereas\" clauses of the most recent mortgage or deed of trust.",

    "paragraph_4": "An adequate number of copies of the partial release, for recordation and for the records of the borrower the purchaser, and the trustee (if any), should be prepared for execution by REA. In addition, please furnish one copy for REA records.",
    "paragraph_5": "Where a successor trustee has been appointed to succeed a trustee named in a deed of trust, a \"Whereas\" clause of the release should refer to this fact and to the recorded evidence of such appointment. Where a trustee corporation named in a deed of trust has merged with another institution, or has changed its name, a \"Whereas\" clause in the release should explain the variance in names between the named trustee and the trustee executing the partial release.",
    "paragraph_6": "If a partial release of lien has recently been prepared and executed by REA for the borrower, a review of this partial release will be helpful to the attorney in preparing the proposed new release. Any additional security instruments or supplements that may have been executed by the borrower subsequent to the earlier release should, of course also be listed in the new release.",
    "paragraph_7": "In order that REA may be in a position to xecute the proposed release the release must include the specific provision in the attached Exhibits A, B and C to the effect that the release will not affect or impair the Government's liens on other properties of the borrower not expressly released, and that the release is made without warranties and without recourse."
